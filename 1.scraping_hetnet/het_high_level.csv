Louis Paul Abeille, 1719-1807,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/abeille.htm,"French lawyer, government official and Physiocrat. Born into a well-connected Breton family, Louis-Paul Abeille served from 1758 as a lawyer in the Breton Estates and king's procurator in the Breton marches.  Abeille became inspector-general of commerce and manufactures.  Having served as Trudaine's secretary, he was appointed in 1768 secretary-general of the Bureau of Commerce in Paris (a position that had been previously promised to Morellet). Despite his provincial roots, Abeille's early writings, notably the Corps d'observation (written under the direction of the Vicent de Gournay) quickly brought him to the attention of Enlightenment economists in Paris.  He was an early convert to Physiocracy, being probably the third disciple of Quesnay, after Mirabeau.  Abeille promoted their ideas in several publications (all anonymous), notably the Principes (which drew praise from the Physiocrats, and was duly attacked by  Forbonnais).  Nonetheless, Abeille seemed attracted more to the laissez-faire policy prescriptions, preferring to focus on the effects of particular barriers to trade, than the general points and nuances of Physiocratic theory. As a result, he was gradually pipped in the master's attentions by the capable young Dupont de Nemours.  It was a quarrel with Dupont that prompted Abeille to break with the Physiocrats after 1768. In his later years, he became increasingly associated with Neo-Colbertistes like Necker. Abeille was one of the leading members of the Société Royale d'Agriculture of Paris (f. 1785).  He was ennobled in 1787 by Louis XVI.      Major Works of Louis-Paul Abeille     Resources on Louis Abeille    All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Pierre Abélard, 1079-1142,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/abelard.htm," Early French Scholastic logician, philosopher, theologian and teacher at Paris, pioneer of the ""Scholastic method"". Not an economist by any stretch of the imagination, but important for the early history of Scholasticism, in bringing Aristotlean logic to bear on Christian theology. Abelard pioneered the method of finding contradictions in authoritative texts and resolving them rationally (e.g. Sic et Non).  On the basis of the then-thin corpus of Aristotle's works (only the translations of Aristotle's logic by  Boethius were available), Abelard articulated the ""Nominalist"" (Aristotlean) challenge to the dominant ""Realist"" (Neo-Platonic) theology.  Realism had been embraced by the Church since the time of St. Augustine,  and was at this time represented by its greatest master, Anselm of Laon.  Drawing from Aristotle, Abelard disputed the Neo-Platonist assertion of the transcendental existence of universals, and contended these were only human abstractions drawn from particulars. (ergo abstract concepts were merely ""names"", not actual things, thus ""nominalism"") Originating from the region of Nantes, Pierre Abelard was educated by William of Champeaux (a disciple of Anselm's) at the Paris cathedral school of Notre Dame. Around 1103, Abelard defeated William in a debate, and went on to found his own school at Melun. A few years later, around 1108, when Champeaux had retired to the monastery of St. Victor, Abelard returned to Paris and defeated him in debate again. Denied succession to the chair at Notre Dame, Abelard crossed the Seine river and set up his own school in Montagne Sainte-Geneviève (area of the future Sorbonne). Around 1113, Abelard went to Laon, and disputed with Anselm himself, prompting the latter to expel him.   Returning to Paris, by 1115, Abelard finally got the cathedral school chair of Paris and was made canon at Notre Dame. Abelard was now at the height of his fame, attracting and cultivating a crop of brilliant young students. Abelard's career came to a crashing end around 1118, as a result of Abelard's dalliance with Heloise, the daughter of a colleague.  Castrated and resigning his posts, Abelard retired to the abbey of St. Denis, teaching at a nearby priory.  But disputatious as ever, Abelard soon got into trouble again.  In 1121, accused of Sabellianism (a heresy ancestral to unitarianism, denying the Holy Trinity), Abelard was indicted and censured by the ecclesiastical council of Soissons.  In 1125, Abelard retired to a monastery in Brittany and resumed his contact with Heloise, who was at that time confined to a convent at Argenteuil (the famous correspondence between Abelard and Heloise stems from here). Around 1130, Abelard was allowed to return to Paris and resume teaching at Montagne Sainte-Geneviève.   It was during this time that Abelard wrote his most famous works. Abelard was called to defend his works in 1140 at the Synod of Sens, before the powerful Cistercian abbot Bernard de Clairvaux.  But the proceedings were not a disputation (as he had expected) but a trial.  Bernard had the rationalist writings of Abelard (and also Arnold of Brescia) condemned by the Synod. Peter Abelard died in 1142.  His students, notably Peter Lombard and John of Salisbury  would carry on his legacy (another student, Guido di Castello, ascended to St. Peter's throne as Pope Celestine II in 1143, just after Abelard's death).  Abelard's school of Sainte Genevieve, together with the cathedral school of Notre Dame and William's school at Saint Victor, are regarded as the triple-cradle of the University of Paris, which would take shape before 1170, with royal recognition by 1200, and papal recognition in 1215. The pioneering methodology of Abelard would be adopted by the Scholastics.  Armed with the greater hoard of translated works from Aristotle that soon arrived, the Scholastics would dominate the European intellectual landscape from the 13th to 15th Century.

Francesco Accorso (Accursius), c. 1182 – 1263.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/accursius.htm," Italian Scholastic jurist of Bologna,  the great glossator of civil law (Roman law) in the Middle Ages. Francesco Accorso (nicknamed ""Accursius"")  of Bagnolo  was originally from the outskirts of Florence, and went on to study civil law  under Azo of Bologna.  Accursius received his doctorate around 1213, and went on to teach in Bologna. The Justinian code (Corpus Juris Civilis), the great compendium of Roman civil law, originally compiled in the 6th C. had been recovered in Bologna in the late 12th C.  Bolognese scholars, from Irnerius onwards, had written numerous glosses (notes on the margins of the manuscripts) to explain the definitions, content and meaning of the Roman legal concepts in Justinian's texts.  Around 1220,  Accurius began his monumental task of collecting sorting the glosses scattered through numerous manuscripts, and compiling them into a single collection.  Accursius's collection, known as the Glossa Magistralis (""Great Gloss""), of the entire Justinian corpus was completed around 1228, and came out in 1234/35.  (the comparable feat in canon law was the Glossa Ordinaria of Johannes Teutonicus). The influence of Accursius ""Great Gloss"" on the development of civil law and jurisprudence in centuries to come can hardly be overstated.   Typical of his authority is the old formula Quidquid non agnoscit glossa, non curia agnoscit (""What the gloss does not recognize, the court does not recognize""). Accursius continued teaching at Bologna throughout the end of his life, sometimes working on the side as a consultant, lawyer and examiner of Bolognese notaries.  He died in 1263.

Henry C. Adams, 1851-1921,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/adams.htm,"  Henry Carter Adams was an early American economist, one of the forerunners of the American Institutionalist school. Henry C. Adams was born in Dearborn, Iowa.  Descended from among the earliest English Puritan settlers of Massachusetts, Adams's father Ephraim Adams, a Congregationalist missionary, had been one of the earliest European settlers in Iowa territory.  He was tutored at home by his father, before proceeding to Grinnell College (which his father had founded), from which he graduated in 1874.  He proceeded to enroll in Andover theological seminary, intending to take up the ministerial life.   But he soon changed his course and decided to study economics, which he believed was essential to understanding morals and social reform.  In 1876, Adams entered graduate study at the newly-founded The Johns Hopkins University.  In 1878, Adams became the first Hopkins student to receive a Ph.D. for an economics thesis on the history of US taxation.   He subsequently undertook a two-year study tour of Germany, imbibing the lessons of the German Historical school.  It was in Berlin where Henry C. Adams met Andrew D. White, and persuaded him to appoint him to a lectureship that would introduce economics at Cornell University in 1879.  Adams split semesters teaching at Cornell and Johns Hopkins until 1881, when he began splitting his time between Cornell and Michigan. From his dissertation onwards, Henry C. Adams quickly emerged as a prominent public finance economist - his Public Debts (1887) and Science of Finance (1898) becoming textbooks in the field.  Although conservative in some respects, Adams parted ways from contemporary American apologists by his criticism of laissez faire, calling for regulation of the railroads and the legalization of trade unions.  Jointly with Ely, Adams was one of primary forces behind the creation of the American Economic Association in 1885.  His 1887 article on state regulation, contributed as an AEA monograph, was a pioneering classic in the field.  He was later elected president of the AEA in 1896. Adams was forced out of Cornell in 1887 because of his ""radical"" opinions (Adams identified his 1886 Scientific American article on labor, an impromptu speech during the heat of the Gould railway strike, as the cause of his dismissal).  Adams subsequently became a full professor of political economy and finance at the University of Michigan in 1888, where he remained until his death.  During part of this time,  from 1887 to 1911, Adams took up the job of head statistician at the Interstate Commerce Commission (for which he would deliver several statistical reports on railways and public utilities,  emphasizing the indispensability of state collection of corporate accounts and statistics  for proper regulation; his reflections compiled later in his 1918 book).  Towards the end of his life, Adams composed an economics textbook with an Institutionalist emphasis for use in high schools (1918).      Major Works of Henry C. Adams     Resources on Henry C.

Herbert Baxter Adams, 1850-1901,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/baxteradams.htm,"American historian of the ""New Generation""  at Johns Hopkins. Born in Shutesbury, Massachusetts of early English colonial stock, Herbert Baxter Adams was educated at Philips Exeter Academy and went on to enroll at Amherst College, graduating in 1872 at the top of his class. After a year teaching classics at Williston Seminary, Adams left the United States for graduate study in Germany. After a few months in France and Lausanne, Adams enrolled at courses in history and political science in Heidelberg in early 1874 (where he met fellow American student John Bates Clark). He proceeded for a period of study at Göttingen and Berlin, before returning to Heidelberg to complete his doctorate in 1876 under political scientist J.C. Bluntschli and the German historicist Karl Knies.

Herbert Baxter Adams returned in the Fall of 1876 to the United States to take up a fellowship in history at the newly-founded the Johns Hopkins University. From 1878, Adams was made associate professor in history (he also held a part-time appointment at Smith College in Massachusetts between 1878-81) and, finally, in 1891, ""Professor of American and Institutional History"". 

Although primarily a historian, Henry Baxter Adams saw it as a part of political science. His principal area of research was early American colonial and educational history.  Adams is often credited for introducing the ""seminar"" system of teaching into American universities and making student research central to graduate studies. Adams's history seminar at Hopkins was influential and much imitated. In 1882, Adams launched The Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science, and in 1884 was one of the founders of the American Historical Association. He also edited the ""Contributions to American Educational History"" series for the US Bureau of Education. Hebert B. Adams was the head of the Department of History, Economics and Politics at Johns Hopkins.  Through the 1880s, historian Herbert Baxter Adams and economist Richard T. Ely trained the next generation of American Institutionalists at Hopkins.  Adams's most notable students however were primarily historians, notably Woodrow Wilson and Frederick Jackson Turner. Falling ill in 1899, Adams died in 1901.      Major Works of Herbert Baxter Adams     Resources on Herbert Baxter Adams All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Irma Adelman, 1930-2017,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/adelman.htm," Irma Adelman was born in Czernwotz, Romania, to a Jewish family. The family moved to British Palestine in 1939, subsequently Israel after 1948, where Irma would complete her school education. She emigrated to the United States to enroll at the University of California Berkeley, where she would obtain her BA in 1950 an eventually her Ph.D in 1955, with a thesis on Walras's monetary theory. As a woman, Irma Adelman had difficulties securing a permanent position, and would hold a series on temporary appointments at Berkeley and Stanford. During this time, she published several seminal works, .e.g. on the Klein-Goldberger model confirming the shock-based cycle hypothesis of Frisch (1959), computation of indexes using hedonic pricing (with Griliches, 1959) and her theoretical book on economic growth (1961).   In 1962, Adelman obtained a permanent position at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.   It was during this period that she began her work in economic development, and was a frequent consultant used by the the USAID in Washington DC.  She served as an important consultant for the South Korean government's development plane from 1965. It was during her period there that Adelman initiated her long collaboration with Cythia Taft Morris, and began her work on large scale econometric models, bringing factor analysis into economics.  Adelman moved to Chicago in 1966 to take up a position at Northwestern.  It was here that Adelman initiated her long collaboration with Cynthia Taft Morris, and began her work on large scale econometric models, bringing factor analysis into economics.  She also went on to pioneer the construction of computational general equilibrium models.  However, her work as a development economists drove her back to Washington, initially at the World Bank in 1971, then at the University of Maryland from 1972.   Adelman returned to her alma mater, UC Berkeley, in 1979, initially at the Department of Agricultural Economics.  She remains at Berkeley to this day.

Gustav Åkerman, 1888-1959,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/akerman_g.htm," Swedish economist, Gustav Åkerman was the older brother of Johan Henryk Åkerman.  A student of Knut Wicksell at Lund, Gustav Åkerman proposed in his 1923-4 dissertation to integrate fixed and durable capital into the circulating capital model of Wicksell - which he claimed would eliminate those troublesome ""Wicksell Effects"". His work prompted Wicksell to reconsider his own theory of capital, attempting a reformulation in a famous ""Note on Dr. Åkerman"" (1923). Gustav Åkerman went on to teach at the University of Gothenburg (Göteborg), where he was professor of economics and sociology from 1931 (succeeding Gustav Steffen).  He continued his work on the theory of capital (1931), thereafter turning to history.      Major Works of Gustav Åkerman   Resources on Gustav Åkerman All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Johan Henryk Åkerman, 1896-1982,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/akerman.htm,"  Swedish economist, younger brother of Gustav Åkerman. The younger Åkerman was arguably more original than his elder brother.  Johan Henryk Åkerman's dissertation at Lund,  Rhythmics of Economic Life (1928), announced his life-long interest in business cycle theory (e.g. 1931).  There was, in his view, a strict synchronization between short and long cycles.  Åkerman's attempts to formulate a theory would involve incorporating a prescient concern with an endogenous business cycle theory reliant in part upon seasonal cycles which, he argued, were correlated with and could propagate large and longer economic swings.  This vision of synchronized cycles was severely critized by Ragnar Frisch (1931).  Although largely ignored outside Sweden, Åkerman's ""causal association"" (1931) theory is a precedent to very recent work on seasonal cycles.  Åkerman was also the first to identify the ""political business cycle"" (1947), a result for which he is better known in the Anglo-Saxon world. Åkerman also pursued more expansive work.  In his two monumental volumes on economic theory (1939, 1944), Åkerman attempted a sweeping theory of historical and structural change and how that, in turn, determines specific economic phenomena. This made him quite critical of the pure theory and the cavalier aggregation methods of the Stockholm School (see Åkerman (1953) and the subsequent debate in the Ekonomisk Tidskrift). Åkerman's works include a concern with methodology, epistemology and institutional factors that is akin to, but not superseded, by Myrdal. His work, much of it published in Swedish, German or French and often littered with his unique jargon, has had a far greater impact on the Continent than the English-speaking world. Johan Henryk Åkerman became a lecturer at the University of Lund in 1932. A decade later, in 1943, Åkerman succeeded to Wicksell's old professorial chair at Lund (vacated when Erik Lindahl moved to Uppsala).  Åkerman and his approach are sometimes characterized as the ""Lund School"" (as distinct from the ""Stockholm School"").   His older brother, Gustav Åkerman, was holding the chair in Gothenburg.

Albertus Magnus, c.1200-1280.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/magnus.htm," St. Albertus Magnus, or ""Albert the Great"", was a German Scholastic philosopher, known as Doctor Universalis. A native of Swabia, Albertus Magnus studied at the University of Padua, and subsequently joined the Dominican Order of Preachers in 1223.  He proceeded to teach theology at a variety of cathedral and monastery schools in Germany, notably Cologne.  It was during his stay at Cologne that he met the young Thomas Aquinas, who would remain a lifelong disciple. In 1245, Albert Magnus  (accompanied by Aquinas) moved to Paris, for his doctorate, and, in 1248, returned to the newly-founded Studium in Cologne, to take up office of Regent, with Aquinas as his lieutenant.  In 1250, Albert, assisted by Aquinas grew, drafted a curriculum of study for Dominican Regulars and in 1254, participated in the defense of the Regulars in the great conflict of the 1250s, and was elected provincial general of the Dominican order for Germany in 1254.  He would go on later become (briefly) Bishop of Regensburg. Albertus Magnus (the ""Universal Doctor"") was one of the first European commentators on Aristotle (coming on the heels of Grosseteste's translation), including his economics.  His pupil, Thomas Aquinas, would carry on that legacy.      Major Works of Albertus Magnus   Resources on Albertus Magnus All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Claude-Camille-François Comte d'Albon, 1753-1789,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/albon.htm,"French Enlightenment litterateur from one of the more distinguished families of Lyons and Count of Albon. Historically, the ""Counts of Albon"" was the French title for the feudatory  ""King of Yvetot"", an ancient, miniscule and ostensibly independent Norse principality in Normandy (of which he was ""King Camillus III""). Well received in the court of Louis XV at an early age, Comte d'Albon broke into print barely out of school.  The young Comte d'Albon was a disciple of the Physiocrats, writing and delivering a decent eulogy to Quesnay after his death.  D'Albon's three volume Discours are essentially curious observations on various countries that he had traveled (England, Holland, Italy, etc.), while generally well-received, have also been criticized for revealing a certain immaturity.

Armen A. Alchian, 1914-2013,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/alchian.htm," Armen Alchian's output may be sparse and informal, but it has been among the most influential. Although he was at the Rand Corporation and UCLA for most of his career, Alchian's approach to economics has been closely associated with the ""Chicago School"".  The reason for this judgment rests on his virtuoso use of Neoclassical price theory in some rather complicated corners of economics, thus making him one of the founding father of New Institutional economics. In his famous 1950 contribution to the ""maximization debate"" in the theory of the firm, Alchian introduced the ""survival"" principle of evolution into analyzing market structure: perhaps not all firms consciously maximize profits; but the competitive price mechanism and the market will weed out those who do not.  Although at any time we may have non-profit-maximizers, in the long run, as the process of evolution continues, only profit-maximizers will survive. Thus, the assumption of profit-maximization in economic theory, Alchian argued, was a valid generalization even if it did not correspond to fact at any point in time. This argument is clearly more acute than the simpler one offered by Milton  Friedman, and served as an important precedent for ""evolutionary"" economics. Alchian's critique of Keynes's theory of investment (1955) is a classic in investment theory while his work on unemployment (1969) was one of the first to consider the natural rate of unemployment arising from ""job search"". His 1972 work with Harold Demsetz on property rights was a generalization of Coase's work. Finally, his famous 1964 textbook with W.R. Allen is an exemplary treatment in the Chicago vein - preserving and extending the Neoclassical market paradigm to handle all sorts of economic problems and describing purported ""market failures"" not as failures as such but as ""market outcomes"" in the face of transactions costs and information problems.

Alexander of Hales, 1183-1245,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/alexhales.htm,"English Scholastic philosopher at Paris, founder of the Franciscan theological school. Originally from Halesowen (Gloucestershire), Alexander of Hales studied and taught at the university of Paris. In the 1220s, he composed a Glossa on Peter Lombard's Sentences (f.1150),  one of the first commentaries on Lombard, and the first to make extensive use of  the works of St. Anselm of Canterbury.  After a brief sojourn in England (where he served as archdeacon of Coventry), he returned to Paris. He composed his Quaestiones disputae shortly after his return.  Around 1236, at the advanced age of fifty, he became a Franciscan friar, founded the Schola Fratrum Minorum in Paris, and become the first Franciscan to hold a professorial chair at Paris.  Alexander of Hales is best known as the putative author of the Summa universae theologica, a magisterial commentary on Peter Lombard's Sentences, commissioned by Pope Innocent IV.  How much of it was actually written by Hales is uncertain - it was still unfinished at the time of his death in 1245, and it was completed by his students (notably Jean de la Rochelle) over the next decade  It is believed the bulk of it might have been written by the latter. Alexander the Hales significance is threefold.  Firstly, for being the first to place Lombard's Sentences (f.1220s) as the centerpiece of theological training; secondly, for being the first to make extensive use of the newly-recovered works of Aristotle and his Arab commentators; thirdly, for staking out the Franciscan school of theology, giving what had been thus far a activist-oriented mendicant movement some theological heft.  In this, he was joined by his contemporary, Robert Grosseteste, who had been establishing a Franciscan school at Oxford in parallel to Hales's efforts in Paris.   The Summa nonetheless takes a highly critical stance against the arguments of Aristotle and the Aristoteleans, finding they have little to offer, and and embracing instead the usual Christian Patristic authorities  - notably St. Augustine - and their traditional arguments (e.g. that knowledge of God cannot be obtained through reason alone, but by contemplating his ""creations"" as analogies, etc.)  As such, despite its ""new"" Scholastic style and sources, the doctrines and arguments in the Summa are thoroughly traditional and show little innovation.  Although highly praised in his time - Alexander of Hales was granted the honorifics Doctor Irrefragabilis (""Irrefutable Teacher"") and Theologorum Monarcha (""King of the Theologians"") by the Pope - he has been regarded as overrated by later Scholastics and historians. Roger Bacon was quite critical, and some modern historians consider him little more than the chairman, or even just a collective pen name, of a group of anonymous Franciscan scholars in Paris (alternatively, authorship is sometimes assigned to Jean de la Rochelle) Alexander of Hales was succeeded in his Paris chair by his disciple Jean de la Rochelle.  Hales also taught St. Bonaventure up to the bachelor level.      Major Works of Alexander of Hales   Resources on Alexander of Hales All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Sir Archibald Alison, 1792-1867,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/alison.htm," Scottish Episcopal cleric, lawyer, jurist and sheriff of Lanarkshire.   Born at Kenley, Shrospshire, the son of an Anglican vicar, Archibald Alison was educated in Edinburgh, Scotland. Pursuing a legal career, Alison was called to the Scottish bar in 1814, and was appointed sheriff of Lanarkshire in 1828. In 1851, Archibald Alison was elected Rector of Glasgow University.  Sir Archibald Alison was an Episcopalian Tory, a rather rare combination in Scotland. He was a frequent contributor to Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, a Tory review. Like Tories of his day, Alison embraced a traditional, paternalistic ""organic"" view of society and, from his court in Glasgow, gained a reputation as a jurist very much alarmed by the changing conditions of the poor in the industrial age.  But both his articles and his record on the bench demonstrates he was an active opponent of allowing the poor to take matters into their own hands, tolerating neither expansion of the suffrage nor trade union activity. Archibald Alison's principal claim to fame is his wildly successful History of Europe (1833-42), where his Tory proclivities seeped through in his resounding condemnation of events like the French Revolution.  In numerous articles and other publications, Alison defended the Corn Laws, the Poor Laws, slavery and other bêtes noires of the Whiggish Classicals.   Alison's principal contribution to economic debates was his 1840 treatise on population, which built upon Malthus's population doctrine with a twist.  He focused particularly on Malthus's recommendations on the enbourgeoisement of the proletariat, i.e. that if the poor could somehow be inculcated with the ""superior"" habits of the middle classes, they would curb their fertility and climb out of their vicious circle of poverty. Alison was particularly keen on deciphering the causes of ""emulation"".  He reasoned that this was easier done in the towns, where the proximity of people and the competitive spirit of commercial activity generated pressures to ""emulate"" the habits of one's betters, but also to keep an ever-higher standard of living  (in a ""keeping up with the Joneses"" sort of way, an effect he expounded upon at length).   But Alison despaired of the condition of the countryside, where people were relatively isolated from each other, there were few examples of  ""betters"" (absentee landlords were the rule) and class stratification was deep. Social mobility, Alison insisted, was made all the more impossible by the growth of large farming estates and the disappearance of small farms that might have been accessible to an ambitious rural laborer.   All this, Alison concluded, worked against the ""emulation"" principle; there was very little hope that the rural poor would ever be able to curb their fertility as their town-dwelling brethren had done.  He recommended a ""return"" to the pastoral ideal of small yeoman farmers, resident landlords, cross-class interaction and mobility, to achieve the emulatory effect of voluntary restraint and lift the rural poor.  Needless to say, Alison's ideas were more romantic yearning than policy-effective.  The novelty of Alison's work, then, is the emphasis he placed on emulatory effects not only of ""moral"" habits but also of consumption, and the need to pay attention to the conditions for social mobility in different contexts. In both these regards, Alison is much quoted by later population theorists.   Alison was a member of the Royal Societies of both Edinburgh and London.

Maurice Allais, 1911-2010 ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/allais.htm," An independent-minded French economist, Maurice Félix Charles Allais strove to carry the message of the original Lausanne School of Walras and Pareto into the modern era, through what we have called the Paretian Revolution of the 1930s.  Maurice Allais wrote two major treatises in the 1940s, Á la Recherche d'une discipline économique (1943, reprinted 1952) and Economique et interet (1947) whose inspiration was to a great part derived ""from meditation upon the works of Leon Walras, Irving Fisher and especially Vilfredo Pareto, three great masters who deeply influenced me"" (Allais, 1992). As a later commentator put it, had Allais written these two works in English, ""a whole generation of economic theory would have taken a different course"" (Samuelson, 1983). In his 1943 opus, Allais provided the groundwork for much of the Paretian system, including the first proofs of the Fundamental Welfare Theorems in both a static and intetemporal framework. He went on to unveil what are now standard ideas about market failures in a general equilibrium setting. Recognizing the potential implications of natural monopolies, transactions costs and unnatural rents on market efficiency, Allais made several quite ""radical"" policy proposals. His affinity to the old Lausanne school extended to the points on policy, e.g. sharing the latter's call for the complete nationalization of land and massive income redistribution by capital taxation. Allais's work on intertemporal equilibrium and capital were extended in his 1947 book and further developed in other articles (1960, 1962, 1965, 1967). Among his contributions in 1947 was the invention of the now-famous ""overlapping generations"" (OLG) model (before Samuelson). Allais also introduced the ""Golden Rule"" for optimal growth (long before Phelps, but after von Neumann). The Baumol transactions demand for money rule was also anticipated by Allais in 1947. The contribution Allais is generally best known for in the Anglo-Saxon world is the ""Allais Paradox"" in the theory of choice under uncertainty - which he presented in a series of papers in 1953. Succinctly, the paradox claims that the assumptions made in conventional expected utility theory contradict real life decisions - specifically, Allais finds behavior which contradicts the expected utility rule. The idea introduced by Allais is that there is a systematic relationship between the an agent's attitude towards risk and the ""degree of certainty"", what was later called the ""common consequence effect"".   Discovering this paradox, Allais led the way to new attempts at formulating new theories of decision-making under uncertainty (e.g. 1983, 1984, 1986, 1988, 1991). In his earlier 1943 book, Allais's introduced several other advances in general equilibrium theory besides welfare theory and the concept of an intetemporal equilibrium: namely, he introduced a unique non-tatonnement process of stability without interim prices. In 1971 and after, Allais called for a re-examination of the foundations of the Neo-Walrasian economics he had helped create, proposing instead a theory of ""markets economies"" relying on his 1943 process. This process relied on the ""search for surplus"" in exchange, which eschewed the concept of price as a guiding principle. Equilibrium, Allais claimed, is achieved when surpluses are exhausted and only then can prices be deemed to exist. His theory of surpluses and markets is best outlined in his 1989 treatise, Théorie Générale des Surplus (see also 1973, 1981, 1986, 1987). Allais's legacy is mixed. Through his two major works (1943, 1947) and as mentor of two of the most prominent pioneers of Neo-Walrasian theory, Gerard Debreu and Edmond Malinvaud, Allais channeled numerous concerns of the original Lausanne School economists into the post-war General Equilibrium program. Today, he might be best known for his development of the ""Allais Paradox"" in uncertainty theory, but most of Allais's highly original contributions - notably his surplus theory of exchange and stability and his unique ""psychological-relativistic"" theory of money (1966, 1972, 1974, 1975) - have been either completely ignored or surreptitiously stolen by the mainstream economics establishment without due acknowledgement. His calls for a re-examination of the foundations of Neo-Walrasian theory and his single-handed attempts to reform it have only recently gotten wider attention.  Nonetheless, despite the numerous setbacks during his professional career, Maurice Allais was vindicated by being made an officer of the Legion of Honor in 1977 and a richly- deserved Nobel Memorial prize in 1988.  It perhaps also should be mentioned that while Allais's contributions to economics have only been reluctantly recognized, his contributions to physics and history have been better acknowledged! A graduate of the the École Polytechnique and the École Nationale Supérieure des Mines (ENSM) of Paris, Allais taught at ENSM from 1944 to 1988.  He was director of research at the Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique (1954-80) and the Center of Monetary Analysis at the University of Paris (1970-85).

Ambrose of Milan, 337-397.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/ambrose.htm," Patristic Latin father of the Christian church. Energetic and highly influential Archbishop of Milan, St. Ambrose was arguably the single person most responsible for bringing the western Roman Empire back to (Nicene) Catholic Christianity and driving Arian Christianity out of the Roman ecclesiastical establishment.  St. Ambrose is regarded as one of the four ""Great Doctors"" of the Church and his theological views continued to be highly influential on later Scholastics.  Born of Frankish roots, Ambrose initially carved out a career in the Roman civil service, eventually becoming consular prefect of Liguria and Emilia. Upon the death of Auxentius,  the (Arian) Bishop of Milan in 374, Ambrose, although only an catechumen, was urged by the Nicene party to take the episcopal seat.  Although refusing at first, Ambrose eventually consented and was baptized, ordained and invested swiftly. Ambrose enjoyed a productive relationship with Roman emperors Gratian the Younger and Theodosius the Great, although he had frosty relations with Arian co-emperor Valentinian II and his mother Justina (at one point in 385, Ambrose famously barricaded himself the Milan cathedral to prevent it from being used by the emperor for Arian services; Ambrose's outsized influence in Milan led Valentinian II to eventually relocate his court to Vienne).  Ambrose presided over the Synod of Aquileia in 381 which deposed several Arian prelates, and welcomed the results of 381 Ecumenical Council of Constantinople restoring the Nicene creed.  Ambrose of Milan was the principal force behind the 382 Council of Rome, presided by Pope Damasus I, which issued the Gelasian decree (a comprehensive list of uncanonical and heretical books) and commissioned St. Jerome to write the Latin Vulgate translation of the Bible. St. Augustine credits his own conversion from Manichaeism to Christianity in 387 to the personal influence of Ambrose.  Ambrose encouraged the Theodosian decrees of 391, banning paganism and establishing (Nicene) Catholic Christianity as the state religion of the Roman empire. Ambrose best-known work is probably his De Officiis Ministrorum, a treatise on duties and ethics addressed to clergy, openly imitating Cicero's De Officiis.  Ambrose articulates essentially a philosophy of Classical Stoicism in new Christian dress.  The Ambrosian twist lies in identifying pagan concepts, such as 'the good' and 'the useful' with Christian concepts of piety and justice.  Like the Stoics, Ambrose emphasizes virtue and condemns the distractions of worldly riches, albeit not for its own sake, but as the key to eternal life.  St. Ambrose's ethics of self-reliance contrasts sharply with the total human 'helplessness' of St. Augustine. Ambrose's De Tobia is one of the first Christian works addressing usury, which Ambrose condemned wholeheartedly, basing himself partly on the Old Testament (e,g, Exodus 22:25, Leviticus 25:36, Deuteronomy 23:19), partly on common prejudice against the practice of usurers, but mostly in the general context of Christian charity (cf. De Officis, Bk. 3.3).  His famous declaration in Bono Mortis, ""Si quis usuram accipit, rapinam facit, vita non vivit"" (""If someone accepts usury, he commits robbery, he shall not live"", Bono Mortis, s.56) was widely quoted by later authors.  Ambrose condemned luxury in De Helia et ieiunio and  avarice in De Nabuthe Jezraelita.  However, he does allow the usury charged to heretics and infidels, on the justification ""ubi jus belli, ibi jus usurae"" (""where war is justified, usury is justified""). Ambrose is the patron saint of Milan, and his remains are found in the Basilica Cathedral of Sant' Ambrogio in Milan.

"Benjamin M. Anderson, Jr", 1886-1949,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bmanderson.htm," Benjamin M. Anderson hailed from a business family in Missouri.  After doing his undergraduate work at the University of Missouri, Anderson taught for a while in a series of local colleges, before proceeding on to his graduate studies at the University of Illinois and Columbia University.  He received his Ph.D. from  Columbia in 1911, under the supervision of John Bates Clark.  He remained a lecturer at Columbia for two years and at Harvard for five, before he decided to abandon academia for the private sector.  In 1918, he was hired by the National Bank of Commerce and, two years later, by Chase National Bank.  He returned to academia in 1939, as a professor of economics at UCLA.  In 1946, he joined the faculty at Cornell. In many ways, Anderson came closest to advancing John Bates Clark's ""organic"" approach to economics.   Anderson's thesis on Social Value, emphasized the social roots of value very much in the Clarkian vein.   His 1917 book also advanced a social organic of money reminiscent of Carl Menger.  Anderson was highly critical of the facile Quantity Theory, and reserved particular vitriol for monetary ""cranks"" (among whom he included Irving Fisher) who offered quick, mechanical ""solutions"" to economic problems and ignored the delicate interface between economy and society.   A laissez-faire activist, Anderson was deeply opposed to state interventionism.  Throughout his years in the private sector, Anderson continued to write and sat on several government commissions.   He also was, incidentally, a world-class chess player.      Major Works of Benjamin M. Anderson   Resources on B.M. Anderson   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Dr. James Anderson, 1739-1808.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/jamesanderson.htm," Dr. James Anderson was a Scottish agriculturalist, farmer, scientist, lawyer and dilettante (James Anderson LL.D.; not to be confused with contemporary namesake James Anderson, M.D., a physician in Madras).  According to Schumpeter (1954), Dr. James Anderson ""had to an unusual degree what so many economists lack, vision."" Raised on a farm in Midlothian, Anderson was primarily interested in the application of scientific principles to farming.  Although he attended lectures at Edinburgh university, Anderson was not quite a part of the network of scholars of the Scottish Enlightenment, although he certainly imbibed in the scientific spirit of the age.  A farmer by profession, Anderson was primarily self-taught in all manner of subjects.  A practical as well as curious man, Anderson was the inventor of numerous agricultural improvements, most famously the ""Scotch plough"" for use on heavy soils.  Most of his discoveries were disseminated in articles contributed to contemporary journals, notably the Edinburgh Weekly Magazine (published under a variety of pen-names, ""Agricola"", ""Senex"" and so on).  In 1775, he published (anonymously) a volume of Essays on agricultural subjects which was quickly re-issued in 1776, with an extra volume, this time under his real name for the first time..  In one of his earliest and most famous performances, in an article on monsoons for the first edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the young Anderson predicted, with remarkable accuracy, the discoveries made by Captain Cook in the south seas before he had returned to announce them. After setting himself up on a large farm in Aberdeenshire, Anderson published his two most famous tracts in 1777, the Observations and the Inquiry, in which he introduced the differential theory of rent based on the extensive margin.  Noting that lands of different degrees of fertility yield different surpluses, Anderson writes:  ""Many persons will, therefore, be desirous of obtaining possession of these fertile fields, and will be content to give a certain premium for the privilege to cultivate them; which will be greater or smaller according to the more or less fertility of the soil. It is this premium which constitutes what we now call rent, a medium by means of which the expense of cultivating soils of very different degrees of fertility may be reduced to perfect equality."" (Anderson, Observations, 1777: p.376) In his Inquiry, Anderson provides a numerical example and even a formula for rent.  He would reiterate this again in his later works, e.g.  ""Rent is in fact nothing else than a simple and ingenious contrivance for equalizing the profits to be drawn from fields of different degrees of fertility."" (Anderson, 1799: Vol. V, p.403). Anderson's 1777 tracts were published a mere one year after Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations -- and it is likely that Smith grew aware of them (he certainly was aware of Anderson himself) .  Robert Malthus came across his work in 1803.    It was only in 1815 that the differential theory of rent was taken up by Malthus, Ricardo, West and Torrens and placed at the center of the economic doctrines of the Classical School.  However, Anderson differed from this later formulation in one important respect: he denied there were diminishing returns to cultivation in the intensive margin (i.e. diminishing returns to more intensive cultivation of a given plot of land).  Predictably, Anderson was an enthusiastic believer that technical ""improvements"" could always overcome these, as his own contributions to agricultural technology had shown. In his 1799 Recreations and his 1801 Calm Investigation,  he was vehement about the possibility of division of labor and increasing returns to scale in agriculture, e.g. ""The melioration of the soil must ever be proportioned to the means that are made use to augment its productiveness; and this will ever depend upon the quantity of labour and manure that is judiciously bestowed upon it. I mean to say that no permanent or general melioration to any considerable extent can ever be effected but by labour; and that, under skillful management, the degree of melioration will be proportioned to the labour that is bestowed upon the soil....In other words, the productiveness of the soil will be proportioned to the number of persons who are employed in active labour upon the soil, and the economy with which they conduct their operations."" (Anderson, 1799: Vol. IV, p.375-6) Anderson supported protectionist Corn Laws, believing that they encouraged British farmers to achieve the extent of cultivation necessary for these improvements to take effect. In recognition of his contributions, Anderson received his doctorate in law from Aberdeen in 1780 and, in 1783, he left his farm in Aberdeenshire and moved to Edinburgh.  In 1783, he circulated a private pamphlet on Scottish fisheries among his friends, which inadvertently brought him to the attention of the government.  As a result,  1784, Anderson was commissioned (or rather conscripted) by the government to undertake a survey of fisheries in western Scotland (published 1785).  His treaties on the American colonies (1776, 1782), were largely against Britain keeping the colonies - not out of any affectation for the colonists, but rather because he believed the colonies were economically detrimental to Britain (e.g. again invoking increasing returns, contra Franklin, Anderson argued that emigration from Britain to America hurt the progress of the British economy.) From late 1790 to early 1794, Anderson edited The Bee, a literary and scientific journal, with a run of eighteen volumes.  This landed him in a bit of an imbroglio, when government officials requested that Anderson give up the names of the anonymous author of some of the more controversial political articles in the journal (he refused).  In 1797, Anderson moved to London, where he dedicated himself to quieter intellectual pursuits, which found expression in the series of volumes of his Recreations, where many of his ideas on rent and increasing returns were expressed.  He died in West Ham.      Major Works of Dr. James Anderson Resources on James Anderson   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Elisha Benjamin Andrews, 1847-1917,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/andrews.htm,"Early American Baptist minister, historian, economist, educator and president of Brown University. Elisha Benjamin Andrews was born in Hinsdale, New Jersey, the son of a line of Baptist ministers. He interrupted his studies at the Connecticut Literary Institute, a Baptist academy in Suffield, Connecticut, to enlist in the Union Army, and served during the Civil War.  He was discharged after being wounded in October 1864 and losing the sight in one eye at the battle of Petersburg. After the war, Andrews resumed his studies, and, after some preparation, eventually enrolled at Brown University in 1866, graduating in 1870. For the next two years, Andrews served as principal of the Connecticut Literary Institute.  Intent on entering the Baptist ministry. Andrews enrolled at the Newton Theological Institution in 1872, graduating in 1874.  He was ordained a Baptist minister in July 1874.  E. Benjamin Andrews subsequently served for a year as a pastor in Beverly, Massachusetts before being tapped to take up the presidency of Denison University in Granville, Ohio in 1875.  At Denison, Andrews was mentor of future Chicago president W.R. Harper.  Andrews left Denison in 1879, to teach theology at Newton TI, while simultaneously teaching philosophy courses nearby at Colby College.

In 1882, E. Benjamin Andrews was appointed by Brown University to become professor of history and political economy. He delayed his appointment by a year, to undertake an academic tour in Germany, studying in Berlin and Munich, and coming under the influence of the German Historical School.

Andrews parlayed his lectures at Brown into a series of textbooks. In 1888, Andrews left Brown to take up an appointment as professor of economics and public finance at Cornell. But he did not stay for long.  After merely a year, E. Benjamin Andrews was elected to take up the presidency of Brown University in 1889. Following American tradition of college presidents, E. Benjamin Andrews was responsible for the moral philosophy course at Brown, which included elements of political economy.  Andrews is regarded as a watershed president of Brown, presiding over the expansion of the college, and its transformation into a modern university. Andrews expanded the offerings in economics, modern languages and science. 

Andrews served as president of Brown for a decade. During this period, Andrews continued contributing to economics debates, and served as US Commissioner to the International Monetary Conference in Brussels in 1892.  In 1897, he was briefly associated with Cosmopolitan University, a fledgling correspondence college financed by Cosmopolitan magazine owner, J.B. Walker. In 1897, Andrews got embroiled in a controversy with the Trustees of Brown University. Andrews was a long-time supporter of bimetallism and the free coinage of silver, which became a major issue in the 1896 US election. The Brown trustees complained that Andrews was frightening off donors, and, at a meeting in July 1897, requested that he change his position.  Andrews refused and promptly resigned.  It quickly became a much-advertised case of academic freedom, and fellow professors and alumni pressured Brown to reject his resignation.  The matter seemed resolved, but the atmosphere remain charged.  Andrews stayed on at Brown for one more year, before finally resigning in July 1898, to take up a position as superintendent of Chicago public schools. Andrews moved again in 1900, to become chancellor at the University of Nebraska.  E. Benjamin Andrews retired from Nebraska in 1908.      Major Works of Elisha Benjamin Andrews     Resources on  E.

Plumart d'Angeul, 1722-1777,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/angeul.htm,"French aristocrat and Enlightenment liberal.  Biographical details are scanty.  Plumart d'Angeul (sometimes given as Plumard de Dangeul) is said to be have been born in Le Mans and was a relative of Veron de Forbonnais. He is was a commissioner or maitre des comptes in the royal household, a member of the Academy of Stockholm and perhaps even served in the French army in some capacity during the Seven Years' War.  He is referred inconsistently as Sieur or Marquis de Plumart d'Anguel. Plumart d'Angeul is said by several authors (notably Dupont de Nemours) to have been an early disciple the prominent free-trade liberal intendant Vincent de Gournay.  In 1752, Plumart d'Angeul translated a 1740 treatise by Spanish Mercantilist Berarndo de Ulloa on the decline in Spanish manufactures, believing it contained valuable policy lessons (and warnings) for the French State.  He was subsequently directed by Gournay towards the works of Josiah Tucker.  Plumart d'Angeul's principal claim to fame is his famous 1754 Remarques,  under the fabricated pseudonym of ""Sir John Nickolls"". [the treatise also claimed itself to be a second edition, published in Leyden, thus making the French censors imagine a first edition had already passed the review process and overlook it - a common tactic among 18th C. French authors.] The Remarques was a comparative study of the conditions of the French and English economies (and economic policy).  Plumart d'Anguel pointed out that despite France's greater resources, Britain exhibited greater prosperity and growth, and that this was due to the absence of restrictions on trade, and called for the establishment of a similar regime of natural liberty in France - both economic and, more boldly, political.  The French clergy, military and nobility are declared to be institutions inimical to French prosperity, that have maintained the country (and the state) impoverished. Plumart d'Angeul's treatise was in effect an adaptation of Josiah Tucker's Brief Essay of 1750 (title and first seven paragraphs were directly plagiarized and the rest of the text was a free adaptation, bolstering Tucker's arguments by filling in more details of French institutions and policy). Curiously, d'Angeul's book was translated into English that same year, prompting confusion with Tucker's own.  The principal effect of Plumart d'Anguel's treatise was to make Tucker's ideas and arguments accessible to French Enlightenment readers.  It was particularly influential on bringing François Quesnay into economics, the latter having drawn upon it when composing his articles in 1756-7 for the Encyclopèdie.

Étienne Antonelli, 1879-1971.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/antonelli.htm," French economist, principal adherent and popularizer of the Lausanne School in France (not to be confused with the Italian G.B. Antonelli.) Born in Valencia, Spain, to a family of French wine merchants, Etienne Antonelli studied law and published works of an institutional character of the French Historical school. In 1906, he began teaching at the law faculty of Montpellier, where Charles Gide and Charles Rist held sway. It was around this time he fell into the ""social democracy"" movement of Aristide Briand and became an editor of their principal organ, Democratie Sociale, which centered on an ""integralist"" ideology based on decentralized private associations and syndicates. They pushed for social reform, while avoiding the extreme confrontational stance of revolutionary socialism and the ""bankrupt"" ideology of classical liberalism. Antonelli, who was responsible for authoring their manifesto (1910), drew much on the ideas of Proudhon. It was probably Antonelli's political interests that first drew him to the work of Léon Walras.  But he was a swift convert and took it upon himself to popularize the work of the Lausanne School in France.  Antonelli moved to Paris in 1910, taking up an appointment at the law faculty there. It was here he taught some of the first courses in mathematical economics and general equilibrium theory in France, which could culminate in his 1914 Principes.   Antonelli fought in WWI until he was wounded in 1915. He subsequently served briefly as military attache in Russia during the heady days of the revolution (1917-18). In his widely-read account of the event (1919), Antonelli emphasized that the revolution was not an spontaneous outbreak of anarchic revolt, but a rather well-organized and fluid transition from one extremely centralized, repressive system to another. He takes the opportunity to, once again, extol the superior virtues of Proudhonian decentralization. This book would make him a bit of an international celebrity.

In 1919, Antonelli took up an appointment as professor of the history of economic thought at the Lyons faculty of law.  At this time, Antonelli also returned to journalism and political activism, contributing steadily to the Lyon Republicain and the CGT's Le Peuple.  In 1924, he was elected Socialist MP for the Haute-Savoie and participated in the drafting of social security legislation in the late 1920s.  Antonelli retired from political life in 1934, spending his remaining years teaching at Montpellier. It was really at Lyons that Antonelli began to push his interpretative spin of the Lausanne School.  Unlike other economists of the age, Antonelli moved beyond the equilibrium theory and insisted on regarding the entire works of Léon Walras as a comprehensive whole, with the Elements as only one of three pillars in a more general ""evolutionary"" theory of the economy and society.  Antonelli was critical in identifying the role and importance of Auguste Walras to his son's work.  By way of contrast, he took several polemical shots at W.S. Jevons.  Antonelli's 1927 Traité was intended to be the first volume of his own restatement of the tripartite Walrasian vision, although he didn't get around to the remainder until nearly two decades later, in his three-volume 1944 Manuel.       Curiously, Antonelli gave comparatively little weight to the work of Pareto, although this may be more because of his inability to follow - or lack of interest in -  the increasing mathematization of the Italians.  Antonelli's 1944 Manuel  shows how far Antonelli had deviated from - or, by some estimates, failed to keep up with - the Paretian frontier.  Nonetheless, Antonelli can be regarded as the father of a distinct tradition, the so-called ""modern Lausanne School"" (exemplified by François Perroux), which would carry on his mix of economic, sociological, institutional and evolutionary thinking.

After acquiring his degree in mathematics at Pisa in 1883, Antonelli went on to study engineering at Milan.  He proceeded to have a distinguished career in civil engineering, particularly in port facilities, helping design those of Genoa, Naples and Monaco. Like many other engineer-economists, Antonelli's interest in economics was brief and primarily technical.  His privately circulated 1886 manuscript, intended as an introductory chapter to a larger work, was a tremendous solitary contribution to nascent mathematical economics.  Antonelli was probably the first to pose the ""integrability"" problem of deducing utility from a demand function, and showing the symmetry conditions that must be obeyed by an indirect demand function. The integrability question was raised again (and independently) twenty years later by Volterra in his review of Pareto's Manuale and led to flurry of work on the issue. Curiously, Pareto himself had probably read Antonelli as early as 1891, having been lent a copy of his monograph by Maffeo Pantaleone, but didn't make use of it or cite it in his own work.  Antonelli's own piece remained obscure until the 1940s, when it was resurrected by Herman Wold and Paul Samuelson. Antonelli also set out conditions by which one can derive properly-behaved market demand functions by the aggregation of individual demand functions - specifically, noting that market demand is properly-behaved and independent of the distribution of income if and only if every consumer has the identical preferences and these preferences are homothetic. Antonelli's aggregation theorem was independently rediscovered by William Gorman (1953) and A. Nataf (1953).       Major Works of Giovanni B. Antonelli   Resources on G.B.

"René Louis de Voyer, Marquis d'Argenson", 1694-1757.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/argenson.htm," French early Enlightenment aristocrat, statesman, minister and early liberal, originator of the popular liberal maxims 'laissez faire' and 'pas trop gouverner'. René Louis de Voyer was from a leading family of Fench politicians and state officials.  He was eldest son of Marc-René de Voyer, Marquis d'Argenson, a long-time lieutenant-general of police in Paris under Louis XIV and contrôleur-général (minister of finance) and keeper of the seal (minister of justice) during the Orleanist regency, who was implicated by his support of the system of John Law, and forced to resign after it fell apart in 1720. Despite their father's political disgrace, René-Louis (the new marquis d'Argenson) and his younger brother Marc-Pierre (the comte d'Argenson) both aimed for political office.  They were educated at the elite school Louis-le-Grand, counting Voltaire among their classmates and lifelong friends.  Setting off on official careers, René Louis secured an appointment as intendant of Hainaut. in 1720, while his brother Marc-Pierre served in the lieutenancy of Paris. After moving to Paris in 1724, René Louis joined the famous Club de l'Entresol, a new foreign affairs discussion club which met in the apartments of Abbé Alary near the Place de Vendôme, which counted among its members some of the earliest Enlightenment figures, such as the Abbé de Saint-Pierre and (briefly) Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke.  The club met weekly until 1731, when it was shut down on order of Fleury.  Through the 1720s and 1730s, the d'Argenson brothers became associated with the 'war party' in French politics, urging steadfast opposition to Hapsburg Austria, and opposing the pacific and conciliatory policies of chief minister Cardinal Fleury.  When Fleury finally died in 1743 and Louis XV took personal charge of the government, Marc-Pierre was appointed Secretary of War, and, a year later,  in 1744, René Louis became Secretary for Foreign Affairs, during the middle of the War of Austrian Succession.  The d'Argensons helped secure the appointment of Machault d'Arnouville as contrôleur-général in late 1745.  The d'Argensons political ascendancy was checked by the sudden emergence of Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV, at the center of French politics. In early 1747, criticized for failing to parlay French military victories into diplomatic success, René Louis de Voyer was forced to resign from ministry of foreign affairs.  His brother Marc-Pierre held on to the ministry of war for another decade, serving as the leading rival of the Madame de Pompadour for influence over Louis XV.  Contemporary accounts frequently contrast the socially tactless René-Louis, blunt and honest, with the smoother Marc-Pierre, a silver-tongued, diplomatic and often devious courtier, to explain the different careers of the siblings.  While too clumsy to hold office himself, René-Louis, the deeper philosopher of the two, nonetheless continued to be influential behind the scenes.   The d'Argensons were ambivalent in their support for Machault d'Arnouville's attempts at fiscal reform, notably his 1749 proposal to replace the hole-ridden dixième with the vingtième, a new 5% tax on property and income, with no exceptions for nobles and clergy (a proposal vigorously opposed and eventually sunk by Pompadour, then the mouthpiece of the Parlements).  Pompadour's intrigues eventually managed to separate Machault d'Arnouville from the d'Argensons, with the result that the d'Argensons had little qualms dislodging Machault from finances, and securing the appointment of one of their own creatures, Jean Moreau de Séchelles, as contrôleur-général in 1754.  The Séchelles appointment, however brief (he lasted less than year), was the closest René-Louis d'Argenson got to getting his visions of economic liberalism implemented into policy.   Almost at d'Argenson's personal direction, Séchelles set about undoing a lot of the old restrictions and Mercantilist policies implemented in earlier years, but his tenure was cut short by illness in the Spring of 1756, and the ministry subsequently fell into the hands of Pompadour's clique. René-Louis died in January 1757.  Two weeks later, Pompadour finally got rid of his brother Marc-Pierre, forcing him to surrender his office of Secretary of War in favor of his nephew  Marc-René, the son of René-Louis and new Marquis of d'Argenson.  Less ambitious than his father and uncle, Marc-René's tenure was brief and unremarkable. Out of regard for his family's political careers, René-Louis d'Argenson published next to nothing in his lifetime.  Shortly after his death, only one significant treatise appeared, Considérations (written sometime before 1744, published  1765), a review of the political constitutions and histories of various countries, concluding with a proposal for a constitutional monarchy for France.  There also appeared the Essais, a collection of gossipy essays on the French upper political circles in 1785.  But from 1725 until his death, d'Argenson diligently kept journals and wrote numerous memoirs and detailed notes.  Although d'Argenson's original notes were later lost in a great fire in the Louvre, numerous copies of much of them had already been made and were subsequently published.  A small collection of memoirs was published by Baudoin in 1825; another collection by Jannet in 1857 and still a third collection appeared in 1859-67, edited by Rathery under the auspices of the Société de l'Histoire de France.  Although mentioned by Dupont de Nemours, d'Argenson's economic ideas were only really revealed when historian August Onken set out on a hunt for the origins of the ""laissez faire"" maxim, and traced its first appearance to d'Argenson's memoirs.  The phrase's first appearance is contained in a series of notes d'Argenson wrote sometime after 1735 (published in the 1857 Jannet collection), known as the Pensées sur la réformation de l'État.  Here (esp. p.361ff), d'Argenson articulates his opinion on economic matters, taking a strong position for free trade and the lifting of restrictions on commerce.  D'Argenson adopts as his maxim ""pour gouverner mieux, il faudroit gouverner moins"" (p.362) (""to govern better, govern less""), a maxim later Physiocrats reduced to simply Pas trop gouverner (""Govern not too much""). [Note: d'Argenson's phrasing is reminiscent of the popular American maxim, ""That government is best which governs least"", attributed variously to Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson and Henry Thoreau.  While d'Argenson's original writings were (probably) not accessible to the American maxim's author, it might have been channeled through a Physiocratic midwife.]  It is in d'Argenson's Pensées that the laissez-faire slogan makes its first appearance: ""Laisser faire, telle devrait être la devise de toute puissance publique, depuis que le monde est civilisé. Les hommes sont sortis de la barbarie; ils cultivent très-bien les arts; ils ont des lois, des modèles,des essais en tous genre pour connoître où sont les bonnes pratiques. Laissez-les faire, et vous observerez que là où l'on suit le mieux cette maxime tout s'en ressent."" (v.5, p.364) setting up the observation that prosperity arises from competition and economic freedom, and denounces government interference enabled by monarchical tyranny and wrong-headed doctrines. He extends that freedom to foreign trade as well: ""Laissez les étrangers venir chercher vos marchandises; laissez-les jouir du métier de crocheteurs, de voituriers, de fiacres. Que craignez-vous? Un marchand ne viendra pas seul. Ainsi ile mettent au rabais, et vous vendez à juste prix."" v.5, p.367 and concludes with his famous outburst against Mercantilist dogma on trade: ""Détestable principe que celui de ne vouloir grandir que par l'abaissement de nos voisins! Il n'y a que la méchanceté et la malignité du coeur de satisfaites dans ce principe, et l’intérêt y est opposé. Laissez faire, morbleu! Laissez faire!!"" (p.372) D'Argenson's ideas on liberalizing commerce were reiterated in the draft of an article Mémoire à composer (dated July 1742, published in v.4 of the 1865 Rathery ed., this memoir was unknown to Oncken). D'Argenson has also been attributed as author of two anonymous articles in the Journal d'économistes of 1751. In the first of these, a review of the Marquis of Belloni's Dissertazioni on commerce, d'Argenson launches into a wholesale condemnation of Mercantilist doctrines and calling for the establishment of a regime of economic liberty.  It is here that Argenson relates the now-famous anecdote of the meeting (prob. c.1680) between the powerful French minister Jean Baptiste Colbert and a certain M. Le Gendre, a member of a deputation of merchants.  When the eager Mercantilist minister Colbert asked the merchants how he could be of service, what the French state could do to improve their commerce, M. Le Gendre, replied simply ""laissez-nous faire"" (Leave us be, lit. Let us do) (d'Argenson, 1951: p.111).  This is the first known appearance of the laissez-faire phrase in print.  His second JdE article is thinly-disguised allegory of royal administration and government, told in the form of advice to a landed noble in managing his private estates. D'Argenson's favorite economic maxims also appear in other unpublished comments, e.g. d'Argenson reiterates his ""pour gouverner mieux, il faudroit gouverner moins"" maxim along with the exclamation ""Eh morbleu, laissez faire!"" in a comment on a 1755 essay on the grain trade  (Jannet ed., v.5, p.134), as well as just a little later ""Laissez libre, tout ira bien"" (p.136). Naturally, d'Argenson was not the first to forge free trade and non-interference slogans.  Boisguilbert's ""laisse faire la nature"" (1707) is a close predecessor.  But it is probably the Colbert-LeGendre story, as related in d'Argenson's 1751 article, that introduced the phrase laissez faire as a slogan of economic liberalism.  Vincent de Gournay (whom d'Argenson met), was sufficiently charmed by the story (at least according to Turgot) to adopt the maxim laissez-faire, laissez-passer as his own.  It was enthusiastically popularized by the Physiocrats  (in the English-speaking world, the maxim finds its first appearance in another re-telling of Colbert-LeGendre tale in George Whatley's Principles of Trade (co-authored with Benjamin Franklin, 1774: p.401)

Aristippus, 435-356 BC ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/aristippus.htm," Ancient Greek scholar, a student of Socrates and founder of the hedonistic ""Cyrenaic School"".  Although his works do not survive, we have some knowledge of his doctrines from the account of Diogenes Laertius and, a little more fanciful, from Xenophon's Memorabilia. Aristippus identified the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the ultimate Good in life.  Although an ""ethical"" hedonist, he based his arguments on psychological observation (esp. of children).  Thus, for Aristippus, the pleasure-pain calculus is the ""voice of nature"" and it is our moral duty to follow it.  Unlike the later Epicureans, the Cyrenaics saw pleasure and pain in terms of bodily sensations, and thus as separate, distinct feelings.

Aristotle, 384-322 BC.  ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/aristotle.htm," Ancient Greek philosopher, Aristotle, was born in Stagira, on the Chalcidice peninsula in the northwestern part of the Aegean Sea.  His father had been a physician in the court of Amyntas II of Macedon.  Upon his father's death, Aristotle was raised by relatives at Atarneus (on the Aeolian coast of Asia Minor).   In 367 BCE, at the age of seventeen, Aristotle found his way to Athens and studied in Plato's Academy.  Aristotle was to remain at the Athenian Academy for the next two decades.  Ineligible for citizenship, Aristotle would remain a metic (resident alien) in Athens. After Plato's death in 348, leadership of the Academy passed to Plato's nephew Speusippus.  Perhaps disappointed he was passed over, and finding the xenophobic atmosphere in the city increasingly hostile to Macedonians and northern Greeks like himself, Aristotle left Athens around 347.  Traveling to Asia Minor, Aristotle arrived in Atarneus at the invitation of the local ruler, Xernias.  He was accompanied by his colleague Xenocrates, and soon joined by older colleagues Erastus and Coriscus.  After a brief time at Xernias's court, they were given land at Assos to form a new school there.  However, only four years later (for reasons unknown), Aristotle moved to the island of Lesbos and founded a new school at Mytilene. In 342, king Philip of Macedon invited Aristotle to Pella, to serve as a tutor of his thirteen-year-old son, Alexander (later, the Great).   But this engagement was also cut short three years later, when the young Alexander came to power and was too busy for tutors.  Aristotle returned to his birthplace in Stagira (which had been lavishly reconstructed by Alexander) but was soon bored.   Aristotle returned to Athens in 335 and taught at a gymnasium called the Lyceum for the next decade.   Aristotle's students and followers in Athens were known as the Peripatetics (for Aristotle's habit of walking as he lectured).  .This was probably the most productive period of his life.  Aristotle is estimated to have researched and written about 150 works during this period.  The range of topics was vast, but Aristotle seemed to approach them all in the same systematic way.  Reflecting his background as a physician's son,  who had trained in biology, Aristotle took to grasping entire fields of knowledge, and breaking their concepts down into categories and classifying them taxonomically. Beyond his comprehensive treatment of topics, Aristotle also set forth his own detailed theories, and laid down the questions to be asked and the manner in which to answer them. Aristotle's approach to ""philosophy"" (meaning knowledge in general) is often contrasted against that of his old teacher Plato.  Roughly speaking, Plato had tended to be an idealist, believed the material world deceptive, and that the origin of ideas emanated from some higher metaphysical realm, that pure ideas, or ""forms"", existed somewhere above the world, that could only be accessed by reason.  Aristotle was much more empirical, and believed ideas were merely human abstractions derived from real world observations.  For economists, Aristotle's most significant work are his Politics and Ethics, which contain his most important insights for social science.  His Economics, by contrast, is little more than a handbook of household or estate management, and perhaps less useful.    His starting point on social science is his conception of human society as a natural organism. Aristotle is often contrasted to the Sophists, a school of thought which believed in a disjuncture between human nature and human civilization (culture, laws, etc.), and that virtue could only be achieved by discarding the trappings of civilization and following the ""natural"". Aristotle starts of his Politics with a denial of that dichotomy, asserting that man is designed by nature to live in civilized social units, yielding his famous dictum ""man is by nature a political animal"".  He gives a conjectural history of the formation and evolution of political units, from the family household, to the village, to its ultimate expression, the Greek polis or city-state. His Politics are, in fact, a theoretical postscript or summary, of a research project undertaken by himself and his students examining the political constitutions of some 158 Greek city-states (only one of the research reports - on the Athenian constitution - survives).  Unlike Plato, who conjectured about an ideal republic abstractly before proposing how to implement it in practice, Aristotle drew from existing political structures to find what worked and what did not work.  The perennial taxonomist, Aristotle identified three types of constitutions - Monarchy, Aristocracy and ""Polity"", which in their corrupted form, show up as Tyranny, Oligarchy and Democracy.  He believes that states should be ruled according to the idea of the good, which he identifies as the flourishing of virtue among its citizens.  He identifies virtue as living a life according to reason, or ethics.   Ever the philosopher of the golden mean, Aristotle warns against extreme types, and is suspicious of utopian schemes.  He does not believe the political structure has to be perfect, but only approach the goal of virtue in this world.  He does not impose a single formula - acknowledging that different political structures might fit different ""temperaments"" of peoples.  Nonetheless, roughly speaking he sees the better societies are those governed by educated, adult free men of some economic means (and thus leisure to reflect).  Women and slaves, he asserts, lack ratiocinative faculties, they are naturally incapable of reason, and thus require to be directed.  Whereas the poorer classes, being economically desperate, are prone to corruption, and likely to rule according to their factional class interest rather than for the good of the polis.  Aristotle writes extensively on the impact of wealth in society, and the dangers of excessive wealth inequality as both a corrupting and destabilizing factor.  He believes in active government schemes to reduce inequality and undertaking other activities, such as provision of public education. Upon the sudden death of Alexander the Great in 323, Aristotle realized that his close connection to the Macedonian monarchs would him a prime target for vengeful Athenians who had chafed under Macedonian rule.  Predictably enough, Aristotle was indicted for impiety.  But unlike his predecessor, Socrates, he decided not to appear before the Athenian tribunal.  Instead, Aristotle and his family slipped out of Athens and made their way to exile in Chalcis (in Euoboea) where he died soon after.  Aristotle appointed Theophrastus as his successor in the leadership of the Lyceum, and entrusted him with his writings (essentially Aristotle's notes from his Lyceum lectures)  Aristotle's teachings were carried on in Athens by the Peripatetic School, which remained active for centuries, although Aristotle's writings remained in limited circulation, and were at one point reputed lost.  It is only really after 60 BCE when Peripatetic leader Andronicus of Rhodes put out a new edition of Aristotle's works, that they became accessible to the rest of the Graeco-Roman world.  In 529 CE, the Emperor Justinian shut down the Platonic Academy of Athens, feeling the pagan philosophy to be a threat to the new Christian order of the Byzantine Empire.  The academics were scattered, many to the borderlands of Persia, and the memory of Aristotle's works was clandestinely preserved only by a few scholars.  When the Abbasid Caliphate set up the School of Wisdom in Baghdad in the late 9th Century, Aristotle's works were resurrected from obscurity and translated by Muslim scholars.     The bulk of Aristotle's works were lost to western (Latin) Europe during the Dark Ages, during which time Aristotle was thought to have been merely a logician.  This was based on the availability of only two of Aristotle's works, the Categories and Interpretation, as translated by Boethius, a 6th C. Roman in Ostrogoth Italy.  Both were standard texts in Latin schools for several centuries.  The neo-Aristotlean 'Nominalist' or 'Conceptualist' position during the early Medieval Scholastic debates were based largely on these two works plus Porphry's Introduction, a prelude to Aristotle's Categories composed in the 3rd CE.  The rediscovery of the remainder of Aristotle's works in the Latin west would have to wait until the 12th Century. Around 1120, the remainder of Boethius's translations of Aristotle's logical works (Prior Analytics, Topics and Sophistical Refutations), began to be found.  In the 1140s,  James of Venice, an Italian in Constantinople encountering the Aristotlean revival in the East, completed the logical organon by translating Posterior Analytics and possibly re-translating the pieces Boethius had already done  James went on to breach other parts of Aristotle's philosophical opus for the first time, translating Physics,  Metaphysics (up to Bk. IV), De Anima and the bulk of the Parva Naturalia collection.  The Italian monk Burgundio de Pisa, for instance, translated works of Christian Neo-Platonists like Gregory of Nyssa and St. John Damascene, which paraphrased a lot of Aristotle's philosophy.  Around the turn of the century, there emerged a manuscript known as Ethica Vetus, a Latin translation of Books II and III and Aristotle's Ethics.  In 1240, the ""middle commentary"" (known as Liber Nicomachae) by Ibn Rushd (Averroes) was translated by Herman the German.  Finally, in 1246-47, Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, translated the Nichomachean Ethics whole.  The Politics and his other works followed not long after.    The translations of Aristotle and his commentators prompted the explosion of Medieval Scholasticism, spearheaded by Albertus Magnus and his student Thomas Aquinas, who worked a merger of Aristotlean philosophy and Christian theology.  Aristotle was catapulted to cultish new heights, feted by the Scholastics as the supreme authority about everything. That reign continued virtually unbroken until the Renaissance humanists and early scientists began chipping away at the Aristotelian edifice         Major Works of Aristotle     Resources on Aristotle   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Kenneth J. Arrow, 1921-2017,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/arrow.htm," One of the most prominent economic theorists of the twentieth century, Kenneth J. Arrow has made fundamental contributions to numerous fields, most of then concentrated around Neo-Walrasian general equlibrium theory and welfare economics, of which he can be considered one of the primary architects. Kenneth Arrow was a thorough New York City product: born and raised in the city, educated at City College (CCNY) and subsequently a graduate student in mathematical statistics at Columbia under Harold Hotelling and Abraham Wald. It was at Columbia that he was nudged towards economics. Finishing his Ph.D coursework in 1942, Arrow's subsequent dissertation was to become a decade-long affair. After a stint during World War II in the Weather Division of the USAF (which resulted in his 1949 article), Arrow returned to Columbia in 1946 and, with dissertation topic still missing, he began taking steps to move into the private sector - passing a series of actuarial examinations and searching for jobs in the insurance industry. During this time period, Arrow attended  Jacob Marschak's mathematical seminar at the New School.    Hotelling and Wald, exasperated at Arrow's drifting, convinced him to join Marschak at the Cowles Commission in Chicago as a research associate in 1947. At the Cowles Commission, Arrow absorbed much of the of the Walrasian research programme being set up under Marschak and Koopmans.  Arrow wrote an article with Marschak and Harris on inventory policy and contributed a piece to the famous 1951 Koopmans-edited Cowles monograph on activity analysis. After two highly inspiring years at Cowles, Arrow moved to the RAND Corporation, a research institute associated with the United States Air Force. He would subsequently move on to teach at Stanford - where he has remained until today, save for an interlude at Harvard from 1968 to 1979. One of the research items at RAND was the then-novel use of game theory to analyze international conflicts and strategy. However, game theory itself presupposed the the parties possessed some sort of utility functions. For parlor games with individual people, this is acceptable, but when dealing with nations as a whole involved in strategic affairs, the question of ""America's"" utility and ""Soviet Union's"" utility was an altogether different issue. Thus, Arrow wondered, under what conditions might it be reasonable to assume that collectivities such as nations possessed nicely-behaved utility functions. At long last, a dissertation topic was found, written and subsequently published as the momentous classic, Social Choice and Individual Values (1951). At the heart of Arrow's 1951 dissertation was the presumption that social choice orderings could be derived from individual choice orderings in a simple axiomatic manner. Arrow's astounding conclusion, since then referred to as the ""Arrow Impossibility Theorem"", was that a certain set of quite acceptable axioms on social choice orderings necessarily implied that there would be a ""dictator"" (i.e. that a single agent's own preferences over outcomes would dominate everybody else's). This celebrated result has since created quite an research industry in social welfare theory to which Arrow himself has contributed numerous follow-ups (e.g. 1952, 1967, 1973, 1977) which has sometimes led him far afield into the philosophy of ethics and justice (e.g. 1967, 1973, 1977, 1978). Arrow's dissertation was concurrently published with another formidable piece of Cowles-inspired work: his proof of the First and Second Welfare theorems in general equilibrium theory (1951). Gerard Debreu, then at Cowles, had independently proved the same theorem. Arrow and Debreu began their famous collaboration which culminated in the celebrated ""Arrow-Debreu"" proof of existence of a competitive equilibrium (1954). All the while, Arrow had been groping for incorporating uncertainty into a general equilibrium context. In a path-breaking article, Arrow (1953) suggested that a simple procedure would be to consider markets for ""state-contingent"" commodities.  Consequently, he demonstrated that in equilibrium with a full set of state-contingent markets, there would be an optimal allocation of risk   However, Arrow, however, noted that a full set of state-contingent commodities might seem too unrealistic. In the same article, Arrow proposed the famous contrivance of ""Arrow securities"", i.e. securities which paid a unit of account in a particular state and nothing otherwise. Arrow demonstrated that a full set of state-contingent commodity markets could be replaced by a considerably smaller set of Arrow securities which spanned the various possible states - and that, consequently, the optimal allocation of risk would be identical as in an Arrow-Debreu model with a full set of state-contingent markets. Arrow subsequently turned his attention to a new topic - the issue of ""stability"" of competitive equilibrium with multiple markets. His interest in this topic was initiated by his work on ""D- stability"" with McManus (1958) which was followed up by a famous article with Hurwicz (1958) on local stability. Perhaps his most famous achievement in this regard was to provide sufficient conditions (i.e. WARP) for global stability of equilibrium in an article with Block and Hurwicz (1959). His subsequent extensions and clarifications with Hurwicz (1960, 1961) outlined both the achievements and problems of stability theory. Arrow had, in the meantime, maintained his interest in mathematical programming. With Hurwicz and Uzawa (1961), he produced a famous rather weak constraint qualification (which replaced Kuhn-Tucker's) for obtaining the saddle-point characterization of a local solution to a non-linear programming problem. With Enthoven (1961) he produced several famous results in characterizing optimization problems when both the maximand and constraint functions are quasi-concave. He moved concurrently into the issues of production and growth. In 1961, with Hollis Chenery, B.S. Minhas and Robert Solow, Arrow introduced the famous ""Constant Elasticity of Substitution"" (CES) production function. In 1962, he produced two famous pieces on ""learning-by-doing"", the predecessor of modern endogenous growth theory. His landmark contributions continued: putting his early experience with actuarial work to good use, Arrow produced his famous 1963 paper on the medical insurance that introduced the concept of moral hazard into economics and announced the dawn of information theory. His 1965 lectures Aspects of the Theory of Risk Bearing introduced the famous ""Arrow-Pratt"" measure of risk-aversion as well as popularized asymmetric information and the terms ""moral hazard"" and ""adverse selection"". Much of Arrow's work on moral hazard, optimal insurance and optimal risk-bearing allocations was collected in his famous 1971 book, Essays in the Theory of Risk- Bearing. Arrow's work on education and racial discrimination (1972, 1973) have since become famous classroom applications of signalling and screening mechanisms under conditions of asymmetric information. Arrow had linked the theory of public investment with uncertainty in a famous article with Lind (1970) arguing for the risk-bearing role of government. His concern with mathematical programming and public policy led him naturally to the topic of optimal policy - in particular, to the use of optimal control theory as a guide to resource allocation, inventory policy, public investment, etc. In a series of articles with Mordecai Kurz (1969, 1970), culminating in their famous 1970 book, Arrow presented numerous applications and extensions of the then-rare use of Hamiltonians. Arrow's famous ""sufficiency"" conditions for an optimum generalized the Mangasarian conditions. In 1971, Kenneth Arrow and Frank H. Hahn produced their famous treatise/textbook General Competitive Analysis (1971) which remained, until recently, a definitive treatment of Walrasian general equilibrium theory. Although research in general equilibrium have since moved in very different directions than those considered by Arrow and Hahn, it was at least partly due to their critical assessments of the treatment of money, uncertainty and stability in a G.E. context which led economists to recast these issues in different light. In 1981-3, Arrow lent his hand as co-editor of the Handbook of Mathematical Economics, which once again summarized the state of the art in G.E. Although Arrow has produced more than a lion's share of groundbreaking contributions to general equilibrium theory, social welfare theory, growth, production, uncertainty, information and optimal public policy, he has not rested on his laurels and continues to produce apace. For instance, his 1979 work with Radner on the theory of ""teams"" and with Chang on the theory of natural resources (1980) has opened new avenues in the theory of organization and resource allocation.  Even more recently, Arrow has teamed up with Hahn again to began tackling the issue of ""endogenous uncertainty"" (1999). Kenneth Arrow is perhaps one of the most respected and admired living economists. In many ways, his life is exemplary in that the almost incredible success that have accompanied him have not, in any way, hardened into that arrogance and pettiness so common among professional scholars. By all accounts, Arrow ranks highly among economists and non-economists, orthodox and heterodox, for his scholarly depth, his wide-ranging interests, his personal and intellectual generosity and openness, and his consistent refusal to engage in ideological quibbling. If nothing else, Arrow is positive proof of Pushkin's conjecture that ""villainy and genius are two things that can never go together"" (Pushkin, 1832). However, we must also remind ourselves that his achievements were neither the result of wild luck nor were they quickly or cheaply bought by hack work, but rather the outcome of an often painful but nonetheless continuous dedication to the task of the scholar. It is evident throughout his work that Arrow has maintained the highest standards of rigor, avoiding oversimplification and ideological rhetoric, clearly aware of and indeed actively demarcating the limits of applicability of economic theory. In so doing, has achieved and granted to us a far deeper understanding of both economics and the economic process than might otherwise have been possible. Kenneth J. Arrow shared the Nobel memorial prize in 1972 with another exemplary scholar, John Hicks, for his ""pioneering contributions to general economic equilibrium theory and welfare theory"". It might be informative to recall that it was Hicks's own Value and Capital (1939) that Arrow counts as the most influential work in his early intellectual career.      Major Works of Kenneth J.

William J. Ashley, 1860-1927.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/ashley.htm," English economic historian. From humble roots in working-class London, William J. Ashley managed to study under difficult circumstances and secure a rare scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, to study history. He came under the influence of historians Benjamin Jowett and Arnold Toynbee and read Schmoller around this time.  After the young Toynbee's demise, Ashley helped edit the lecture notes that went to form Toynbee's Lectures.  Although Ahshley earned a first in history in 1881, he had to wait for some time to find an Oxford college to accept him as fellow (Ashley finally became a fellow at Lincoln College, Oxford in 1885). In 1886, William J. Ashley helped found the Oxford Economic Society, composed young scholars, like Langford L. Price and Arthur Ball, dedicated to the Historicist method.   It was around this time that Ashley emerged as one of the leading English historicists, perhaps the English thinker closest to the German Historicists,  Ashley attacked the universalism and abstractionism of Classical and Neoclassical theory. An opponent of laissez-faire, he was also a proponent of imperialism and state-industry-labor corporatism. Nonetheless, Ashley was unable to find his footing in class-conscious Oxbridge, so he decided to try overseas.  In 1888, Ashley became a professor of economics and constitutional history at the University of Toronto. And, in 1892, was appointed the first professor of economic history at Harvard University in the US,  where he proved highly influential.  It was during his time that Ashley transformed his old Oxford lecture notes into his magnum opus, Introduction to English Economic History and Theory (1888 & 1893). Around 1900, Ashley returned to England, to take the first chair of Commerce at the University of  Birmingham, where he would remain for much of the rest of his life.  In 1903, W.J. Ashley participated in the protectionist tide and his Tariff History (1903) provided much of the source material to help support Chamberlain's movement to reintroduce a protective tariff system.  His 1914 Economic Organization of England has become a classic textbook.  Among his other tireless activities, Ashley translated Schmoller and Turgot and provided new edition of J.S. Mill in 1909, and numerous readers and selections for students and wider audiences.  William J. Ashley was made the first president of the Economic History Society in 1926.

Edward Atkinson, 1827-1905.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/atkinson.htm,"Influential American journalist and economist. Originating from Brookline, Massachusetts, Edward Atkinson attended private schools in his youth.  He obtained his Ph.D. from Dartmouth and an LL.D. from South Carolina.  It was in South Carolina, where he came under the influence of Francis Lieber. Originating from Massachusetts, Edward Atkinson was largely a free trader and hard money man, and widely seen as a spokesman for the New England commercial and manufacturing interests, notably in cotton textiles and later insurance.  Atkinson served as the economic advisor to Hugh McCulloch, Sec of the Treasury in the immediate aftermath of the civil war. A 'hard money' man, Atkinson was behind plans for the resumption of convertibility of national banknotes to specie, but insisted that banks should be allowed to suspend payment if caught in trouble.  He also opposed Carey's calls In 1877 he became president of the Boston Manufacturers' Fire Insurance Company, a post he held until his death.  In 1887, he was appointed a special commission on bimetallism in Europe.  He was active in the Anti-Imperialism League and invented the ""Aladdin oven"" a kerosene-fueled heat-efficient oven.

Thomas Attwood, 1783-1856.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/attwood.htm,"English banker, anti-classical economist and radical activist, leader of what is sometimes called the ""Birmingham School"" of currency and underconsumption . Born in Halesworth, Worcestershire, Thomas Attwood was the third of seven sons of Matthias Attwood, a prominent northern banker and industrialist in Birmingham.   After some schooling in Wolverhampton, Thomas Attwood entered his father's banking house of Attwoods & Spooner in Birmingham. The Attwoods - including Thomas, his older brother Matthias Junior and younger brother Charles - were active in civic life in Birmingham. Thomas Attwood entered public sphere in 1811, at the age of 28, when he was elected to the position of High Bailiff of Birmingham. In 1812, Attwood led a delegation from Birmingham to petition parliament against the Orders in Council blocking trade with America, earning him great popularity with the artisans of Birmingham.  In 1813, he mounted a campaign against renewing the charter of the East India Company.  Attwood rose to national prominence during the anno horribilis of 1816.  Attwood wrote tracts (Remedy in 1816, followed up by the Prosperity Restored and Letter to Vansittart in 1817), analyzing the economic crisis in terms of underconsumption, and called for looser monetary policy (more paper currency) and government-funded public works to address the economic depression and problems of unemployment.  Attwood brothers organized a petition for relief, which was presented to parliament by Henry Brougham in 1817, and credited with inspiring Vansittart's programs in 1818. Attwood's Observations (1818) are perhaps his most reflective work.  In 1819, Thomas's older brother Matthias entered parliament for a rotten borough.  The Attwood brothers opposed the Peel Committee of 1819's decision to resume convertibility, believing it an unnecessarily destructive contraction. While Matthias dueled with Peel in parliament,  Thomas's Letters (1819) denounced the resumption act more publicly.  Attwood testified before the House committee on agricultural distress in 1821.  Believing that proper national economic policy, mindful of the needs of the urban merchant and working classes, would not be conducted by a parliament dominated by landed interests, Thomas Attwood became heavily involved in movement for Parliamentary Reform.  In late 1829, Attwood founded the ""Political Union of the Lower and Middle Classes of the People"" in Birmingham towards that end.  After Parliament Reform succeeded in 1832, Thomas Attwood was elected as Birmingham's first member of parliament.  Attwood served in parliament for several years, and kept pressing his views on currency at every opportunity.  Among Attwood's notable acts in parliament was the presentation of the monster Chartist petition in June 1839.  Disappointed at its defeat, Attwood resigned from parliament and retired from political life at the end of that year.

Originally from New Haven, Connecticut, Lyman Hotchkiss Atwater graduated from Yale in 1831.  After a period at Mount Hope in Baltimore, Atwater returned to Yale divinity school in 1833.  He was licensed as a Congregationalist minister in 1835, and found preferment in Fairfield, Connecticut.  Atwater got involved in the debates surrounding the Presbyterian schism of 1837, and defended the Old School positions.  Atwater began contributing articles to religious reviews, making something of a name for himself. Atwater published principally in the Princeton Review, then edited by Charles Hodge of the Princeton Theological Seminary.  After being given a D.D. from Princeton university in 1851,  Lyman H.

Augustine of Hippo, 354-430,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/augustine.htm," African bishop and Patristic theologian,  Aurelius Augustine of Hippo is regarded as one of the four ""Great Doctors"" of the Church, and arguably the most influential.  Born in Thagaste, the son of a Pagan father and Christian mother, Augustine studied and taught in Carthage during his his youth.  It was here that Augustine converted to Manichaeism (a Dualistic Gnostic religion, then making inroads in the Mediterranean).  He subsequently moved to Italy, staying first in Rome, and then in the imperial capital of Milan.  It was while professor at the imperial academy in Milan that he fell under the influence of St. Ambrose, and converted to Catholic Christianity in 386.  He subsequently returned to North Africa, where he established an ascetic community, and went on to be ordained as a priest in 391 and appointed Bishop of Hippo in 395. Augustine was a prolific writer, fusing Christian theology (which he derived principally from Ambrose) with Neo-Platonist ideas (derived from Plotinus).  This is particularly found in his early, more philosophical works of the 380s, like Contra Academicos and Soliloquies.  Among his apologetic writings of the 390s, .are several (e.g. such as De Vera Religione, De Utilitate Credendi, and Liber de fide) that attempt to explain the relation between Faith and Reason, most notably embracing the Neo-Platonist idea that because reason, by it method, contains and divides, then God, one and unlimited,  is inaccessible to reason, and only accessible to the experience of faith.  However, reason and experience of God's works can bear witness.  Augustine is perhaps most responsible for the Neo-Platonist medieval Christian view that everything in nature is a symbol of some higher truth, and that therefore each natural object supplies, by analogy and metaphor, knowledge of God. Augustine's most famous treatise is his apologetic City of God (started 413, but finished only in 426) which defended Christianity against the common accusation that blamed the decline of Rome on the abandonment of Graeco-Roman pagan worship.  First half of the book is directly referring to the accusation in the context of Roman history, but the second half is where Augustine launches into speculative philosophy, comparing what he calls the two realms, the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the world, and discussing the relationship between them. Augustine deployed his pen in polemics against his old comrades, the Manichaeans, but also against other sects and parties, such as the Arians,  the Donatists, and, most famously, the Pelagians.   A British monk in Rome, Pelagius articulated a doctrine of free will against determinism,  and placed man fully in control of his own salvation.   St. Augustine in Africa and St. Jerome in Antioch were roused into disputes against the Pelagian doctrine through the 410s.  Augustine's solution, a more elaborate Doctrine of Grace and Original Sin, were pronounced in the canons of the Council of Carthage in 1418, which also condemned Pelagianism once and for all. Augustine would be taken up with enthusiasm by Protestants like Martin Luther and John Calvin in the 16th C. St. Augustine was the primary source for Scholastic philosophy, before the rediscovery of Aristotle in the 13th C.   Augustine re-iterated Ambrose's condemnation of usury (e.g De Baptismo contra Donatistas, 400, Lib. 4, ch.9, trans. 1, 2.), without, however, providing new grounds for it.

Robert J. Aumann, 1930-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/aumann.htm," Robert J. Aumann's has been one of the leading figures in the mathematical surge that has characterized Neo-Walrasian economics and game theory in the past forty years. Aumann entered into economics via cooperative game theory - In Neo-Walrasian theory, Robert Aumann is perhaps best known for his theory of core equivalence in a ""continuum"" economy. Aumann introduced measure theory into the analysis of economies with an infinite number of agents - formalizing the ""perfectly competitive"" scenario. In his classical 1964 paper, Aumann proved the equivalence of the Edgeworthian core and Walrasian equilibrium allocations when there are an uncountable infinite number of agents - thereby providing the limit case for future work on core convergence. In order to prove this result was not vacuous, Aumann went on to prove the existence of equilibrium (1966) in this ""perfectly competitive"" scenario. On his way, he contributed to mathematics itself by providing a definition of the ""integral"" of a correspondence (1965), which was previously absent. Previously, Aumann (1962) had swung Ockham's razor and helped remove the axiom of completeness of preferences from the Walrasian theory of choice. In another classical paper with F.J. Anscombe in 1964, Aumann formalized the notion of ""subjective probability"", a concept that had been earlier forwarded by Leonard Savage, that profoundly changed the theory of choice under uncertainty. His contributions to game theory have perhaps been no less path-breaking. Aumann entered game theory in 1959 to carefully distinguish between infinitely and finitely repeated games. With Bezalel Peleg in 1960, Aumann formalized the notion of a coalitional game without transferable utility (NTU) - one of the organizing beacons of his later research. With Michael Maschler (1963), he introduced the concept of a ""bargaining set"". In 1974, Aumann went on to identify ""correlated equilibrium"" in Bayesian games. In 1975, Aumann went on to prove a convergence theorem for the Shapley value. In 1976, he formally defined the concept of ""Common Knowledge"". Also in 1976, in an unpublished paper with Lloyd Shapley, Aumann provided the perfect folk theorem using the limit of means criterion. For Aumann, game theory is clearly the more ""general theory"". His ruminations on the role of game theory in economic analysis are wonderfully laid out in Aumann (1985). Robert Aumann won the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics in 2005, with Thomas Schelling, ""for having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis"".

Clarence E. Ayres, 1891-1972.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/ayres.htm," Consciously or not, the impression of the American Institutionalist School held by most people in the postwar period was moulded or affected in some way or other by the Texas economist and philosopher, Clarence E. Ayres. While Mitchell waded through neutral statistics and Clark and Commons sought conciliation, it was perhaps Clarence Ayres alone who kept the distinct and confrontational character of American Institutionalism intact. Many have claimed that Ayres's famous ""Institutionalist Dualism"", as laid out in, e.g. 1944, 1951, lies at the root of the Institutionalist approach. Ayres's ""Dualism"" stresses the division and coexistence of ""technological"" and ""ceremonial"" behavior, terms derived from Veblen to separate, roughly, the inventive from the inherited aspects of economic structure respectively. Ayres propounded a theory of ""institutional lag"" whereby technological changes inevitably kept economic technology one step ahead of inherited socio-cultural institutions. The process of Veblenian ""evolution"" Ayres envisaged was that technological changes were generated by spurts of instinctive inventive activity to innovate in technological processes but that the relatively slow, inherited socio-economic structures would be maladapted to these changes. With glacier-like gradualness, institutions would eventually respond to the new technology, but by the time they adjusted, the next round of inventive activity would have been skipping along further ahead, thus maintaining a permanent lag and thus incogruity between social structures and economic technology. Ayres's interpretations of Veblen's work have been seen variously as both advancing and stifling the Institutionalist programme. On the one hand, it take a relatively malign view of social institutions as both hopelessly incompetent and regressive, a point irksome to Institutionalists of a ""progressive"" vein (e.g. Commons). Furthermore, Ayres's insistence on a ""technological""-deterministic interpretation of Veblen's evolutionary theory brought him into confrontation with the more subjectivist members (or associates) of American Institutionalism - particularly the belligerent Chicago economist, Frank H. Knight. However, Ayres himself did not necessarily think progressive policy inherently pointless. For instance, he was himself an avid proponent of ""guaranteed income"" (i.e. negative income tax, e.g. 1967) and although, quite early on, he identified and denounced the socio-cultural and ideological biases of economic theory (e.g. 1918, 1934), he did not himself argue that it was not capable of assisting both understanding and transformation.

Martin de Azpilcueta (Navarrus), 1493-1586.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/navarrus.htm," Martin de Azpilgueta (also known as ""Doctor Navarrus"") was a Spanish Dominican priest and leading legal scholar of the Salamanca School.  He studied at Cahors and Toulouse (although Navarrus left before Jean Bodin arrived there).  Navarrus was appointed as professor of civil and canon law at the university of Salamanca.  From 1538, he taught at Coimbra and became a personal counsellor to the King of Portugal.  Navarrus principal economic work is his Comentario (1556) where Navarrus explicitly denounced price controls and defended money-changing and usury. Independently of his Toulouse schoolmate Jean Bodin, Navarrus is considered an independent discoverer of the Quantity Theory of Money . As he wrote, ""Other things being equal in countries where there is a great scarcity of money, all other saleable goods, and even the hands and labor of men, are given for less money than where it is abundant.""  Navarrus extended this to a more general scarcity theory of value, arguing that ""all merchandise becomes dearer when it is in strong demand and short supply"".  Navarrus served on a papal commission assembled in 1568 that resulted in a famous bull by Pope Paul V, Cum Unas, characterizing personal annuities as usurius.  However, Navarrus' subsequent ""clarifications"" of the bull took out much of its force, noting how it contained several loopholes that allowed redeemable forms of annuities (a point Toledo and the Jesuits ran with in 1571)   However, Navarrus's principal effort was in justifying interest achieved by bills of exchange, a growing practice in Mediterranean commerce.  Pope Pius V, in his 1571 bull In Eam, had condemned exchange banking as usurious, but Navarrus commentaries again opened up loopholes.

Azo of Bologna, c.1150-1220,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/azo.htm," Italian Scholastic jurist and influential glossator of civil law. Sometimes called Azo Soldanus or Azo Porcius, to distinguish him from other jurists with that name.  A native of the city of Bologna, Azo studied under Johannes Bassianus at Bologna, and went on to teach civil law for over thirty years. He was also active in the political life of the city.  Azo was one of most influential glossators and teachers of Roman civil law at the University of Bologna.  His glosses (marginal explanatory notes and comments) pervaded the books of Justinian's Corpus Juris Civilis.  He had a reputation for a very careful and ""pure""  treatment of the Roman law, endeavoring to draw out the pure abstract principles of legal theory, to allow the deepest and widest understanding, rather than depending on a mass of practical or illustrative examples.  Azo of Bologna is best known for his Summa codicis, a handbook of Roman civil law used as the primary textbook at Bologna.  Written in 1208-1210, it was completed by his students. The authority of Azo of Bologna is found in the common student ditty ""Chi non ha Azzo, non vada a palazzo"" (""He who does not have Azo, will not make it in the palace"" - meaning that a thorough knowledge of his Summa codicis was essential for a successful court case or legal career.) The competing apparatus of his contemporary and rival Hugolino, produced something of division within Bologna between rival schools of thought between their students.  Azo was the teacher of Accursius and Johannes Teutonicus.      Major Works of Azo of Bologna Resources on Azo of Bologna All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Charles Babbage, 1791-1871,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/babbage.htm," Cambridge mathematician, philosopher and scientist, best known as the father of computing. Born in Devonshire, the son of a banker, Charles Babbage was educated at Trinity College and Peterhouse, Cambridge.  He pursued mathematics, and received  an honorary degree (without honors) in 1814 and an MA in 1817.  Disappointed by the Newtonian mathematics as taught at Cambridge, Babbage formed the Analytical Society in 1812, with Robert Woodhouse, John Herschel and George Peacock, to promote the use of the analytical calculus of Leibniz.   William Whewell soon joined the effort and, in 1819, the Analytical Society was renamed the Cambridge Philosophical Society and by the 1830s the ""Cambridge movement"" had taken hold and displaced the Newtonian fluxions and fluents throughout many mathematical faculties in Britain. Babbage's principal claim to fame is his invention of mechanical computing machines.  His first effort was the ""Difference Engine"", a crankhandle-driven machine designed to calculate mathematical tables.  He outlined the plan in 1822 and secured substantial government grants for the purpose.  Babbage's initial efforts failed, but that did not deter his search for more funding and more ambitious designs.  In 1837, he outlined an even grander machine, the ""Analytical Engine"", a general-purpose computer ""programmable"" by a punch-card system.  Although it was never built, the mathematician Ada Lovelace (daughter of Lord Byron), who had been following Babbage's progress, designed the first program for such an engine.   This was only one of several inventions Babbage pursued.  Babbage is also credited for the invention of the locomotive ""cow catcher"" (to clear rails of debris), the standard railway gauge and uniform postal rates. In the early 1830s, Babbage was enthusiast for the growing statistics movement.  It was through the efforts Babbage and Whewell that in 1832, that Quetelet was introduced to the British public and the British Association for the Advancement of Science introduced its Section F.  Babbage was also the guiding spirit behind the foundation of the Statistical Society of London in 1833. In his first treatise on economics (1832), Babbage naturally focused on the role of technological change and mechanical improvement. Babbage famously reproached political economists for ""too small a use of facts and too large an employment of theory"" (1832, p.119) - prompting Tooke to rebuke, ""On the other hand, it appears to me that those who are par eminence called practical men may with equal justice be charged with too small an employment of theory and a super-abundance of facts"" (Tooke, as quoted in Goldman (1983: p.598)). It was here that he articulated the notorious ""Babbage Principle"" in industrial organization.  As the division of labor naturally reduces complex tasks to simpler ones, the profitability of a firm is promoted not only because of the higher productivity of the technique, but also by the lower costs from intensive use of (cheap) unskilled labor, sufficient for the simpler task, rather than (expensive) skilled labor.  Babbage's promotion of the idea of displacing skilled labor with unskilled labor in a well-designed factory helped spur the movement for ""scientific management"", or ""Taylorism"" in the late 19th C.  Babbage's Ninth Brigewater Treatise, is actually not part of the Bridgewater series but an independent contribution.  [In 1829, inspired by the work of William Paley on natural religion, the Earl of Bridgewater established, through the Royal Society, a publication series to explore and promote the conciliation of natural science and religion.  Thomas Chalmers and William Whewell contributed the first and third book in that series respectively. The only connection Babbage's volume had was in exploring the same topic; it was not commissioned or funded by Bridgewater and is not recognized as part of it.]       Major Works of Charles Babbage   Resources on Charles Babbage   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Louis Bachelier, 1870-1946.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bachelier.htm," The tragic hero of financial economics was the unfortunate Louis Bachelier. In his 1900 dissertation written in Paris, Theorie de la Spéculation (and in his subsequent work, esp. 1906, 1913), he anticipated much of what was to become standard fare in financial theory: random walk of financial market prices, Brownian motion and martingales (note: all before both Einstein and Wiener!) His innovativeness, however, was not appreciated by his professors or contemporaries. His dissertation received poor marks from his teachers.  Blackballed, Bachelier quickly dropped into the shadows of the academic underground. After a series of minor posts, he ended up obscurely teaching in Besançon for much of the rest of his life.

Sir Francis Bacon, 1561-1642.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bacon.htm," English lawyer, statesman and empiricist philosopher.  Widely regarded as the originator of the modern ""positivist"" view of  science, as opposed to the Aristotlean approach to knowledge of the Scholastics. Argued for grounding of ""natural law"" doctrines in methodological individualism. Born into a family of the ""new nobility"" of Elizabethan public officials, Francis Bacon seemed destined for political life.   After an education at home, Bacon entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1573.  In 1576, his father withdrew him from college and set him to study law at Gray's Inn in London.  He interrupted his studies to enter into the service of Sir Amias Paulet, the English Ambassador to France.  He returned to England upon his father's death in 1579.  Although wealthy, his father had overlooked the young Francis in his will and this ought to have cut short his political aspirations.  But he decided to return to Gray's Inn, finish his law studies and carve a political career on his own.  Bacon managed to get elected to the House of Commons in 1584.  In 1586, he was finally admitted to the bar.  In both parliament and the courts, Bacon acquired quite a distinguished record.  His abilities were such that, almost immediately, he began jockeying for higher political position. Elizabeth's main minister (and Francis's uncle), Sir William Cecil (Lord Burleigh) promised him the Attorney-Generalship.  However, Bacon incurred the displeasure of the Queen herself by leading the opposition to some of her policies in Parliament.  Despite his good connections and obvious abilities, Bacon never got an official appointment in her government.   In 1597, Bacon published his first book of Essays, effectively a collection of aphorisms and reflections on the ""art of life"" -- not in the ideal, but in the real and often ugly world.  They were extremely popular, among both fellow courtiers and the wider population.. In 1600, Bacon earned the Queen's outright suspicion because of his close friendship with the ambitious but undisciplined Robert Devereux (Earl of Essex).  However, Bacon managed to patch up his cold relations with the Queen when it emerged that he had tried to head off Essex's  attempted coup d'etat and then personally led the prosecution against Essex during ensuing the trial in 1601.    After the Queen's death and the ascension of King James I in 1603, Bacon hoped for the public positions that had been denied him.  But new king's leading leading minister, Sir Robert Cecil (Earl of Salisbury) decided to keep Bacon at arm's length.   He was fobbed off with a knighthood in 1603 and then given the half-measure of Solicitor-Generalship in 1607.   With time on his hands, 1605, Bacon wrote and published his Advancement of Learning.  It was a plea for free and critical intellectual inquiry in ""secular"" subjects.  On his journey across the secular subjects, he applauds history and literature, but finds that natural philosophy (i.e. the natural sciences as well as the social sciences) leave much to be desired.  In these fields, Bacon argues, there has been too much bizarre speculation, half-chewed reasoning and little attempt to make propositions coherent or coincident with observed facts (e.g. astrology, alchemy, etc.).  He thus emphasized the need for clear-headed intellectual inquiry, accompanied, guided and verified by the careful acquisition of ""objective"" factual information.  Bacon's career really took off after Salisbury's death in 1612.  He was finally made Attorney-General in 1613 and took a leading role in the new administration.   In 1616, the confrontation over fiscal matters between King and Parliament was taken to courts.  Francis Bacon led the King's council, arguing that the imposition of customs duty was a royal prerogative.  His opponent, Sir Edward Coke, argued that, by common law, it fell within the purview of parliament.  The case ended with Coke's expulsion from the bench. Bacon's friendship and political alliance with the king's powerful favorite, George Villiers (Duke of Buckingham), served him well.  Bacon was placed on the Privy Coucil in 1616, was made Lord Keeper of the Seal in 1617 and Lord Chancellor in 1618.  He was made a peer (Viscount St. Alban) in 1621. The height of Bacon's career was capped by his Great Instauration.  This was planned as a six-volume treatise for the ""renewal of learning"".  Only part two, the Novum Organum, was actually completed.  It effectively picked up the argument of his 1605 book and expands upon it a bit more systematically.  Basically, he logically outlines and defends his positivistic, inductive methodology for scientific inquiry.   This was, by far, his greatest book -- and his greatest failure.  Perhaps if he had more peace of mind, he could have argued it better.  But things were quickly coming to a blazing finale. Being at the center of power, Bacon also acquired a lot of enemies.   The economic crisis of 1620 led to the assembly of a new Parliament in 1621.  Leading the parliamentary opposition to the royal council was the same Sir Edward Coke who had crossed swords with Bacon earlier.  Coke and his party blamed the economic crisis on royal extravagance and the way monopolies and charters had been handled, i.e. corruption. The hated Buckingham, who was in charge of royal patronage, was the obvious target of these accusations.  But as Buckingham was untouchable, the royal council gave up Bacon as a sacrificial lamb to the parliamentarians.  Bacon was impeached by the House of Commons in 1621 on corruption charges and sent to the House of Lord for trial.  He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to indefinite imprisonment in the Tower of London, disbarment from public office, banishment from City of London and a fine of £40,000.  However, King James I intervened immediately on Bacon's behalf, had him freed, reduced the fine and reversed the banishment.  But the disbarment from public office could not be reversed.   With his career suddenly terminated in so humiliating a fashion, Bacon crawled into quiet retirement in Cambridge.  His last few years were concentrated on publishing a new, expanded edition of his Essays.  His final book, the magical fable, The New Atlantis, was published posthumously in 1626.

"Charles Frederick, Margrave of Baden", 1732-1789,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/baden.htm," German prince and Physiocrat. Charles Frederick, Margrave of Baden (in German, Karl Friedrich Markgraf von Baden, in French Charles Frédéric, Marquis du Bade) was a German territorial prince, ruler of margraviate of Baden in the upper Rhine. Charles Frederick ascended as Margrave of Baden-Durlach as a child in 1738, reaching the age of majority in 1746. In 1771, he inherited neighboring Baden-Baden from his late relative Augustus George, thus uniting Baden under himself.  He endeavoured to acquire territory to amalgamate the margraviate of Baden as a contiguous unit, integrate and overhaul the administration of his domains. Charles Frederick's keen interest in promoting the prosperity of his little domain led him to economic writings.  Charles Frederick had hosted the exiled Scottish mercantilist Sir James Steuart, who finished his 1767 Inquiry while in Baden.  But the Margrave himself was drawn to the Physiocrats.  He approached Mirabeau in correspondence in September 1769, and consulted them on a personal visit to Paris in 1771. Charles Frederick contributed to Physiocratic journals, notably a signed article in the opening volume of the re-launched Ephémérides in 1792, faithfully summarizing the principles of Physiocratic economics.  It was written originally by Charles Frederick as a manual for his heirs, and was subsequently republished as a separate volume later that year under the supervision of Dupont de Nemours. Carl Friedrich began introducing Physiocratic policy  in his own principality - most famously, suppressing indirect taxes and introducing the single tax on land, implemented experimentally under the supervision of J.A. Schlettwein in the villages of Dietlingen, Theningen and Balingen in 1770.  Although promising at first, it was not a success, and the experiment was abandoned in the latter two villages by 1776, although Dietlingen would be extended until 1792. He promoted the removal of restrictions on trade in the German Diet.  In 1783, he abolished all remaining labor dues and promoted the establishment of large farms, which ran into political complications. Charles Frederick brought the unemployed Dupont de Nemours to Karslruhe in 1772, endeavoring first to place him in charge of finances (the effort failed), then deciding to appoint him special councillor (in place of departed Schlettwein) and tutor to his heir.  Dupont left Baden in 1774 to take up a position in Poland.  After the fall of Turgot in 1776, Charles Frederick brought the Abbé Baudeau to Karlsruhe as privy councillor, again also briefly. The correspondence between Charles Frederick of Baden and the Physiocrats was collected by Karl Knies in 1892. Charles Frederick of Baden joined Austria's invasion of the fledgling French Republic in 1792, but the little margraviate was eventually overrun by French troops, and in 1796, Charles-Frederick was forced to cede all his domains on the other side of the Rhine. In 1803, he made up for his by acquiring other territories, notably the Bishopric of Constance, from the emperor. In 1805, Charles Frederick flipped over to the French side, and acquired even more territories. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire 1806, he declared himself sovereign prince and Grand Duke of Baden. He continued fighting for Napoleon, and was rewarded with great swathes of territory at the expense of the Kingdom of Württemberg. In all, Charles Frederick probably quadrupled the size of his original inheritance.

Walter Bagehot, 1826-1877.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bagehot.htm," English journalist, closely associated with the English institutionalist-historicist tradition, One of the early editors of the famous and influential ""Manchester School"" newspaper The Economist.  Bagehot was not avidly opposed to contemporary Classical economics, but he stressed the need for more institutional content - especially cultural and social factors. He was one of the first economists to discuss the concept of the business cycle. In his most famous book, Lombard Street (1873), Bagehot introduced a distinct theory of central banking. After Bagehot's death in 1877, The Economist was taken over jointly by the banking expert R.H. Inglis Palgrave and journalist Daniel Conner Lathbury, pipping out its first choice of successor, Robert Giffen, who went on to found the rival The Statist.

Gösta A. Bagge, 1882-1951.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bagge.htm,"Swedish economist and statesman. Gösta Bagge studied economics at Stockhom University under Gustav Cassel. A politically active conservative already in his student years, Bagge founded the conservative Svensk Tidskirft in 1911, with fellow student Eli Heckscher.   Bagge obtained his doctorate in 1917, submitting a dissertation proposing a distinctive equilibrium theory of labor bargaining.  Gösta Bagge went on to join Cassel on the faculty of Stockholm University. In 1921, Stockholm University created a second professorial chair in economics, to be held in conjunction with an appointment as head of the newly-created Institute of Social Policy (Socialinstitutet).  The new chair in economics and social policy went to Gösta Bagge.. After Cassel's retirement, Bagge became gradually isolated as younger faculty members - the ""Stockholm School"" trio in particular, Gunnar Myrdal,  Erik Lundberg and Ingvar Svennilson - carved out space for themselves.   Although Bagge interacted with them, and even conducted the 1936 Wages in Sweden study in cooperation with Lundberg and Svennilson,  the Stockholm Schoolers nonetheless repudiated Bagge.  Although he maintained his professorial chair and directorship of the institute, Bagge gradually detached himself from academia to focus on his political career. Bagge was elected MP party in 1932, and in 1935, became the head of the Swedish Conservative Party.  He served as minister in a coalition government from 1939 to 1944.

Samuel Bailey, 1791-1870,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bailey.htm," English proto-marginalist economist, critic of the Classical Ricardian School.  Bailey's reputation rests chiefly on his anonymous 1825 treatise, A Critical Dissertation, etc., which was written in response to de Quincey's Templars' Dialogue.  Bailey pointed out the logical difficulties of both the labor theory of value and Ricardo's ""invariable measure"".  Bailey also called for the generalization of the Ricardian theory of rent to wages.  As a result, Bailey promoted a  ""cost of production"" theory of value, which incorporated capital as well as labor.   He might also be credited with the introduction of the notion of time-preference, arguing that ""we generally prefer a present pleasure or enjoyment to a distant one, not superior to it in other respects."" (Bailey, 1825).   In response to a critical article in the Westminster Review, Bailey published his 1826 Letter restating his views.

Alexander Bain, 1818-1903,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/alex_bain.htm," Scottish mathematician, utilitarian philosopher and early psychologist.  Educated at Aberdeen, where he showed early promise.  In 1845, Alexander Bain was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at the University of Glasgow.  But finding academic life constricting, Bain resigned after the first year. He moved to London in 1848, where became involved in the utilitarian circle of John Stuart Mill and George Grote.  He had already been writing for the Westminster Review since 1840 and assisted Mill in various editorial tasks. Alexander Bain's principal works are his Senses and the Intellect (1855) and Emotions and the Will (1859), two treatises in psychophysiology, which cemented his reputation as an early father of psychology. In 1860, Alexander Bain was appointed to the chair in Logic and English at the University of Aberdeen, which he would retain until the end of his life.  He dedicated himself to pedagogy, composing several popular textbooks on grammar and rhetoric, that went through various editions, and positioning himself as an educational reformer (e.g. 1878). In 1876, Alexander Bain helped found and finance Mind,  the first English journal of philosophy and psychology, edited by his former pupil, George Croom-Robertson, at UCL. In 1876 Bain helped edit the Fragments of George Grote.  Then, in 1878, Bain put out a a new edition of James Mill's 1829 Analysis of the Mind.  This prompted Bain to go on to write a 1882 biography of the senior Mill and an accompanying volume on the younger Mill.  In his later years, Bain edited the papers of Croom-Robertson (1894) and also his own works (1884, 1903) and  his own biography (1904).

Nicholas Barbon, 1637-?1698.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/barbon.htm," English physician, builder and businessman,  Nicholas Barbon was one of the more careful Mercantilist thinkers, and writer of two notable treatises on money.    He promoted the idea that ""utility"" or ""use"" and scarcity to confer value on goods.  Also the first to discuss the idea of interest as the payment of a ""rent on stock"". Nicholas Barbon was apparently the son of Praise-God Barebone, a leather merchant on Fleet Street, London  firebrand Puritan minister and Fifth Monarchy activist (after whom Cromwell's ""Barebone's Parliament"" of 1653 was named).  According  to some sources, Nicholas Barbon's original first name was the incredulously long ""If-Christ-Had-Not-Died-for-Thee-Thou-Hads’t-Been-Damned"", and that he adopted the name ""Nicholas"" for business purposes, to avoid his name being naturally shortened to ""Damned Barbon""; however, other sources claim ""If-Christ, etc"" was actually his father's first name, which he shortened to the nickname ""Praise-God"" for convenience). Like several other notable 17th C. Englishmen, Nicholas Barbon studied medicine in the Netherlands, initially at Leiden, and obtained his M.D. from Utrecht in 1661.  He enrolled in the College of Physicians in London in 1664, but did not practice medicine for long. Barbon sought to make a fortune, and launched a career as an entrepreneur and business promoter, pioneering developments in three fields - construction, insurance and banking. The opportunity had been afforded by the Great Fire of London in September 1666, which had devastated great swathes of the city.  Barbon promptly set up a construction concern.  His initial efforts were quickly raising buildings from the ashes inside the city walls, but he soon set his eye on the vast undeveloped suburban area between Westminster and London.  Barbon   In the aftermath of the Great Fire of London in September 1666, Nicholas Barbon founded the ""Insurance Office for Houses on the Back-Side of the Royal Exchange"" in 1667, which he managed through 1680, when it took on more partners, and become recast as ""the Fire Office"" (also known as ""the Phoenix""), the first private proprietary insurance company in the English-speaking world. In Barbon's scheme, buildings insured by his Fire Office were affixed with a metal plate of a phoenix rising from the ashes, as a signal marker to the company's fire-fighting brigades. The Fire Office assumed risk of loss up to a fixed amount, with premiums of 2.5% of yearly rent for brick houses, and 5% for wooden frame houses. The Fire Office was organized with an initial fund of £40,000, to be increased by £20,000 for every 10,000 houses insured. Only a year after the establishment of the Bank of England, Barbon in collaboration with John Asgill, a promoter of currency. The Barbon-Asgill Land Bank was founded in 1695.

Barbon blamed the decay of trade on trade restrictions and high interest rates. He proposed a pre-Keynesian theory of effective demand, arguing that savings were detrimental to trade, prosperity and employment, and urging great expendtirue (in this case, luxuries) needed to be encouraged. He supported Child in the scheme to lower the rate of interest in England (then running at 6%, in contrast to the 3% in Holland), and argued that low interest rates would help merchants build up stocks, benefitting the rest of the country by serving as buffer stocks to help stabilize commodity prices and rents.

Enrico Barone, 1859-1924.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/barone.htm," Italian military officer, economist, early disciple of Walras and Pareto and honorary member of the Lausanne School Born in Naples, Enrico Barone enrolled in the Neapolitan Military Academy in 1874 and signed up for a career in the general staff of the Italian armed forces. The technically-minded Barone found an outlet for his abilities in military strategy and science and published articles on issues such as artillery targeting.  In 1887, he began teaching military strategy at the Artillery School and collected his lectures in a 1887 textbook. Barone's treatment of military strategy went beyond merely its technical aspects to incorporate relevant economic and social situations.  This gave him the excuse to begin reading widely in those fields. The early 1890s marked the appearance of the ""new"" mathematics economics in the pages of the Giornale degli Economisti, edited by Pantaleoni.  Barone was particularly impressed by the articles of Pareto (whom he would later refer to as his ""master"").  In 1894, Barone began contributing his own economics articles to the GdE and came into a fruitful correspondence with the  members of the Lausanne School and other Neoclassical economists. Enrico Barone was instrumental in convincing Walras to incorporate variable production techniques - and, by extension, marginal productivity theory - into the Walrasian system. Barone's most famous contribution, however, was in getting the ""Socialist Calculation"" debate started with his famous 1908 article. His position, later taken up by Taylor and Lange, was that it was indeed possible in a collectivist state for a planning agency to calculate prices in order to achieve maximum efficiency. But he did not think it could do ""better"" than a capitalist economy.   In 1908, Barone published his principal economics treatise,  the Principi di economia politica.  Barone was also a capable public finance economist.  His 1912 article was the first to apply indifference curve analysis to compare the relative burdens of income taxes and excise taxes.  He was also an articulate opponent of ""progressive"" taxation schemes as they rested on what he considered highly dubious utilitarian calculations.

Alain Barrère, 1910-1995.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/barrere.htm,"French Post-Keynesian economist of the ""circuitiste"" school. Having read Keynes's General Theory while a prisoner-of-war during World War II, Barrère went on to develop a distinctive approach to Keynesian theory -- what was later known as the ""circuit"" or ""circulationist"" approach -- quite separately from  Neo-Keynesian developments in  the U.S.  In particular, and  from the outset, Barrère identified Keynes's ""monetary theory of production"" as the critical vision part of his system, which was distinct and irreconcilable with the Neoclassical.  In his theory, Barrère notes, it is impossible to do away with the role of endogenous money and Knightian uncertainty, as many post-war Neo-Keynesians did, thus presaging many of the developments of the later Post Keynesiacan school.  In extending his system from the short-run to the long-run, Barrère's followed a similar route taken by the Cambridge Keynesians, albeit keeping money in the story throughout. Barrere was professor at Toulouse from 1946 to 1957, when he developed much of the early part of his theory.  From 1957, he has been in Paris, first at Paris University, then at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes and finally, at Paris I-Sorbonne.

Robert J. Barro, 1944-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/barro.htm," However much theoretical and empirical work Robert J. Barro has done, it is nothing compared with the amount of work he has forced others to undertake in an effort to address his insights. The career of this renowned New Classical macroeconomist from Harvard has evolved through several distinct stages. Nonetheless, at each stage, Barro has made groundbreaking - and controversial - contributions which have reshaped much of macroeconomics since the 1970s. Early in his career,  Barro was a leading figure in Walrasian-Keynesian ""disequilibrium"" macroeconomics in the tradition of Clower and Leijonhufvud - producing, with Herschel Grossman, perhaps the two most definitive pieces in this tradition - complete macromodels with goods market and labor market rationing equilibria (1971, 1976). Almost immediately, Barro turned on his Keynesian roots and joined the Rational Expectations revolution with two central pieces: his celebrated ""Ricardian Equivalence Hypothesis"" (1974) and his famous money neutrality paper (1976). Under a particular set of assumptions (e.g. intergenerational altruism or immortality, perfect capital markets, lump sum taxation, and the condition that debt not grow faster than the economy), Barro's (1974) ""Ricardian Equivalence Hypothesis"" argues that every bond-financed deficit must be met by a future tax increase, that this tax increase would be forseen by living agents and that these agents would care enough about posterity to adjust their present consumption accordingly. In short, this implies that agents do not take a bond-financed fiscal expansion as a lucky windfall but rather will save the entire proceeds in anticipation of the future tax burden - and thus not raise their demand for goods and services. Thus income received by agents from government deficit-spending is all saved - and hence has no effect on consumption (thus no multiplier) - and that these savings go into the demand for the very same bonds that were supplied to finance that government spending (so bond demand rises exactly to meet higher bond supply, and money demand is unchanged) and thus there is no effect on interest rates either. Barro's ""Ricardian Equivalence Hypothesis"" has spawned a virtual research industry of its own as a whole generation of economists have climbed over each other tortuously examining, assailing, and verifying the validity and implications of Barro's theorem (his 1974 paper is among the most-referenced papers in economics today). Barro's 1976 paper on the neutrality of monetary policy (i.e. that changing money supply growth would not affect output or interest or any real variables) followed up on the work of Lucas and Sargent and although less unique, it was no less controversial. Barro nonetheless proceeded on to develop new theories of fiscal policy which respected Ricardian Equivalence (1979, 1980, 1981). His work on ""optimal taxation"" and the impact of permanent/temporary government spending on time paths of output, consumption and interest rates have also been followed up intently by other economists. Barro's essential approach was that, while accepting that the size of a deficit would not matter, fiscal policy can still have an effect on the income and consumption profiles of people over time and thus, one can and should carefully examine particular expenditure and tax schemes for differing welfare implications. Together with D. Gordon, Robert Barro (1983) cracked open another new flood of research in his analysis of inflation as a ""dynamic inconsistency"" problem: the idea that inflation results from a game played between the government (more specifically, the central bank) and the general public. The argument essentially is that Central Banks are often (rationally) tempted to violate their own announced inflation targets in order to reduce unemployment; as a result, the public will generally deduce that inflation targets will not be met and thus raise their inflation expectations accordingly - which will itself increase inflation and make the announced inflation target inoperable from the start. The public policy implication of this idea is that, in order to control inflation, Central Banks should be bound by externally-imposed rules or run by conservative, reputation-careful chairmen in order to build public confidence in announced inflation targets and avoid the temptation to violate them. Such ""rules"" have been experimentally inserted into the charters of central banks in several countries (e.g. New Zealand) as a result of Barro's observations. Never one to shy away from empirical work, Barro has lent his hand to numerous massive and authoritative empirical studies on several macroeconomic issues such as monetary policy, fiscal policy, growth, etc. (e.g. 1978, 1979, 1986, 1987, 1990, 1995). He has accompanied the development of New Classical economics into the fields of Real Business Cycle Theory and the Neoclassical theory of economic growth. His most recent empirical and theoretical efforts have been in attempting to determine the sources of growth - i.e. the factors that make particular countries grow faster than others rather than converge to a common growth rate (1991, 1992, 1993, 1995).

Based on his estates in Chicester, Sussex, John Barton seemed to have dedicated himself to traveling abroad and writing sporadically on wide interests in botany and political economy. Other known activities include serving as a trustee of the Chichester Savings Bank and the Lancaster Mechanics Institute and resigning from the Society of Friends after an acrimonious dispute.   Barton's Observations in 1817, followed up by his Inquiry in 1820,  knocked down a few of the sacred cows of the nascent Classical school.  His impetus was to dismiss the Malthusian population doctrine.  Barton noted that, empirically, the progress of population had preceded and been much faster than growth in wage income, so the former could not be conditional on the latter. Indeed, he claimed, we often find population growth strongest when wages are low.  He posited a curious theory of causation, emphasizing the connection between fertility and security of employment, rather than income. When wages are high, he argued, there is a tendency for employers to fire workers and rely on more labor-saving machinery.  And unemployment is a great deterrent for marriage and starting a family - as well as observed increase in the mortality rate (something Malthus himself had difficulty with).  Conversely, when wages are low, employment increases, so even if incomes are not particularly high, long-term income security is, and thus there is more confidence for workers to start families and thus population growth.  He ascribes the English population growth wave from the increase in precious metals from abroad, which had risen prices and profits and prompted employers to increase their scale of production and go on a hiring spree. Barton's thesis hung on the point of permanent technological unemployment - that is that the introduction of labor-saving machinery would permanently displace workers that would not be absorbed by other branches of industry.  This seemed to echo working class sentiment at the time, which was exhibiting itself in the Luddite wave of machine-smashing.  It also seemed to undermine the confidence Classical economists had placed in the benevolent priestess of technical improvement, and the 'harmoniousness' of class interests in the progress of industry.  He also took a shot at Say's Law, emphasizing the loss of demand by unemployed would not be made up by investment. Barton's essays were stumbled upon by Malthus and commented upon favorably by Sismondi, unfavorably by McCulloch.  Most famously, it provoked David Ricardo to respond to him in correspondence, then revise his own ideas on technological change and compose his famous Chapter 31 (""On Machinery"") in the third edition of the Principles, confirming Barton's argument.  Unlike many other economists, Barton put urgent emphasis on the policy role of emigration (esp. to Canada) in the defusing the population bomb (e.g. 1830), dismissing the Malthusian fear that so relieved, the population would just explode again. Barton also took issue with the free-traders in his 1833 tract, defending the existing Corn Laws on the basis of its differential effects, again notably on employment.  He conceded the cost and collective welfare gains from trade, but demanded that they be weighed against disruption and costs of unemployment, however temporary, in the countryside.  His 1847 tract linked the crisis in the British banking system with the repeal of the tariffs - a phenomenon he had predicted in letters to newspapers written before the fact in 1846.

John Bascom, 1827-1911,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bascom.htm,"American educator at Wisconsin and Williams. Originating from Genoa, in rural upstate New York, John Bascom descended from a line of Congregationalist ministers that stretched back to the earliest Massachusetts Pilgrims.  His father died when he was still an infant, and John and his three older sisters were raised with pious devoutness by their mother.  Bascom obtained his first formal schooling at the relatively late age of seventeen, at Homer Academy, before proceeding to enroll at Williams College, graduating in 1849. Bascom was expected by his family to follow a clerical career, like his father and grandfather. Nonetheless, Bascom decided to try some other avenues first - first spending a year as a schoolteacher, then studying law in Rochester - before finally enrolling in a theological seminary in Auburn.  From 1852, Bascom was a tutor at William College.  After finishing his theological degree at Andover in 1855, Bascom was hired as a full-time professor of rhetoric (English) at Williams College, where he would remain for the next two decades.  Bascom's friend and colleague Arthur L. Perry, was in charge of political economy at Williams.  Nonetheless, Bascom published a textbook on economics in 1859. In 1874, John Bascom became president of the University of Wisconsin, a position he held until 1887.  As per man college presidents of the time, Bascom was un charge of the final-year lectures on economics for Wisconsin students.  Although Bascom started off as a traditional apologist, Bascom gradually embraced Christian Socialism and Progressivism. After being driven out of Wisconsin in 1887, Bascom returned to Williams College, where he lectured on sociology.  In 1891, upon Perry's retirement, Bascom took charge of the political economy at Williams. Bascom finally retired himself in 1903.

Charles Henry Bastable, 1855-1945.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bastable.htm," Irish classical economist. Irish-born Charles Francis Bastable was educated at Trinity College Dublin. In 1882, Bastable was appointed to the Whately Chair in Political Economy at Trinity College, Dublin (which he would hold until 1932 --  a record length!).  Like J.E. Cairnes before him, Bastable was, simultaneously a professor of jurisprudence at University College Galway  (from 1902, moved his jurisprudence chair to Trinity).    Charles F. Bastable was international trade theorist and one of the finest (and latest) expositors of Classical Ricardian theory. However, critical of Mill's international payments theory.  Bastable's Public Finance (1892) was, for a while, considered the authoritative (if altogether a little too ""legalistic"") treatment of the subject.  Generally conservative, Bastable was a proponent of proportional (as opposed to progressive) taxation.      Major Works of Charles Francis Bastable   Resources on C.F.

Frédéric Bastiat, 1801-1850.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bastiat.htm," French liberal journalist, economist and wit.  Claude Frédéric Bastiat originated from Bayonne, in the Pyrenées region of southern France, the son of local merchant. Frédéric was orphaned at 1810 and raised under the guardianship of an aunt. In 1818, Bastiat left school without completing his formal education and went to work for his uncle in Bayonne. He got interested in the issue of trade in relation to the business, and at some early point, Bastiat read the works of Jean-Baptiste Say and Adam Smith. In 1825, Bastiat inherited a landed estate in nearby Mugron from his grandfather. Although not finding much success as a farmer, Bastiat was an enthusiast for new agricultural technology. Bastiat struck up a critical friendship with a neighboring farmer, Felix Coudroy, of socialist inclinations, who would become Bastiat's debating partner and study companion in political economy for the next two decades. In 1831, Bastiat married Marie Hiard, but apparently the marriage was not a success and the two became estranged shortly after. After the July Revolution of 1830, Bastiat put his toe into politics.  He became a justice of the peace (juge de paix) in the district of Mugron in 1831 and was elected member of the local council, the Conseil général des Landes, in 1832. But his attempts to get elected to the national Council of Deputies did not succeed. Bastiat's first writings were a series of pamphlets (one in 1834, three more in the early 1840s), mainly pertinent to taxes and the local economy  - notably the wine trade.  In the early 1840s, Bastiat became a subscriber to the English paper, The Globe & Traveller, through which he became acquainted with the Anti-Corn Law League, the vigorous British free trade movement of Richard Cobden and John Bright.  In 1844, Bastiat submitted his first article to the Journal des economistes, the major French economics journal of the day, which drew considerable attention.  Encouraged, Bastiat took to writing a book on Cobden and the British free trade movement, as well as more articles for the Journal, including the series ""Sophismes économiques"" in 1845, which contained the famous ""Petition of the Candlemakers"" and numerous other satirical pieces that have since become classics of economic commentary.   The toast of the free trade economists, Bastiat visited Paris in May, 1845 and proceeded to London and Manchester in July 1845, returning to Mugron in October. Frédéric Bastiat moved to Paris permanently in 1846.  Later that year, Bastiat and other members of the Société d'économie politique, founded the Paris branch of the French free trade association (Association pour la Liberté des Échanges, orig. est. in Bordeaux in February 1846), serving as its general secretary and editor of its journal, Libre Échange.  Through his writings and activities, Bastiat agitated against the protectionist tendencies of the Orleanist July Monarchy and in particular Adolphe Thiers.  The ""people's revolution"" of February 1848 prompted a change of direction.  Bastiat launched a new paper, the République française, and put out of series of pamphlets directed against the socialists.  Significant among them was Bastiat's Capital et Rente (1849) ruminating over the nature of capital and interest, which had been assailed by socialists. It provoked  a literary duel with Michel Proudhon in the pages of the Voix du Peuple. In August 1848, Frédéric Bastiat  was elected to the French constituent assembly for the department of Landes, and was selected for the finance committee.  Although the weakness of his voice did not let him stand out as an orator, Bastiat was nonetheless returned the next year for the legislative assembly,  Moreover, ill health (tuberclosis) soon began to plague Bastiat, and he gave up more active editing duties.  Following up on a few articles, in 1850, with some difficulty, Bastiat put out the first volume of his Economic Harmonies, articulating an optimistic laissez-faire position and repudiating the concept of class conflict. It contained Bastiat's rejection of Malthus's population doctrine and the more ambitious goal of displacing the classical Ricardian labor theory of value with an exchange (or ""service"") theory of value.  Bastiat may be regarded as a proto-marginalist in line with the catllacticists of the Oxford-Dublin school.  Bastiat's theory in the Harmonies was lauded by H.D. Macleod as coincident with his own, and Arthur L. Perry would credit Bastiat as the primary source for his own catallactic theory.  But Bastiat's theoretical work was not well-received by others, and he was severely criticized by, among others, Cournot,  Lassalle, Cairnes, Marshall and Bohm-Bawerk. Exhausted and ill after its completion, Bastiat went to Italy in the late summer of 1850 to recuperate his health, but died in Rome on December 24, 1850.

Abbé Nicholas Baudeau,  1730-1792.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/baudeau.htm,"  French cleric who later converted to Physiocracy, and became one of its principal disseminators.  A native of Amboise, Nicolas Baudeau was elevated to a regular canon and teacher of theology at the Abbey of Chancelade.  He was subsequently called to Paris by the Archbishop de Beaumont. Abbé Baudeau started off as a Neo-Colbertiste (e.g. in the  Idées d'un citoyen series, 1763-65).  In November 1765, the Abbé Baudeau founded a bi-weekly magazine, entitled Ephémérides du Citoyen: ou Chronique de l'ésprit national, in order to open up a dialogue on economic questions.  Le Trosne published an article in the Ephémérides promoting the Physiocratic viewpoint, so Baudeau thought it fair to publish a series of articles defending the Neo-Colbertiste position in the Physiocrats' own rag, the Journal d'agriculture, du commerce et des finances.  DuPont de Nemours, the editor of the Journal, published Baudeau's article in 1766, but accompanied it with his own comments questioning Baudeau's arguments.   To clarify these questions, the fair-minded Baudeau met with DuPont de Nemours and, overnight, was converted to the Physiocratic point of view.  He relaunched the Ephémérides du Citoyen as a monthly in 1767 with a new sub-title, Bibliothèque des sciences morales et politiques.  In1768, Baudeau departed for Poland on ecclesiastical affairs, and handed over the editorship of the Ephémérides to DuPont de Nemours.  Under the editorship of DuPont de Nemours, the Ephémérides became a doctrinal bastion of the Physiocratic school.  Besides his journal, Baudeau's principal works are his exposition of the ""loi naturelle"" (1767), his discussion of the single tax (1768) and his Première introduction (1771) defending Physiocratic doctrines against the critiques of Galiani. In November 1772, the government closed down the Ephémérides du Citoyen.  In 1774, upon the ascension of Turgot as controller-general, Turgot helped Baudeau helped launch the Nouvelles Ephémérides Economiques.  This new venture was closed down in 1776, with Turgot's fall from grace.  Baudeau attempted to resurrect the journal in 1788, but went mad soon afterwards.  Two interesting asides about Baudeau must be mentioned.  First is his 1767 article, written at the height of a French famine, when he recommended that the wide-spread adoption of cheap mills would enable cheaper bread to be produced and sold.  Mirabeau followed up on his suggestion and the ""cheap mills"" movement was born.  In 1776, Baudeau assaulted the thirty-year old law that required that Paris butchers take their loans exclusively from the Caisse de Poissy (which, accordingly, charged extortionate interest rates).  Baudeau was hauled before the Parlement of Paris, but successfully defended himself and had the law overturned.  He was carried through Paris on the shoulders of rejoicing butchers. In 1785, Baudeau authored an extensive critique of the policies of Jacques Necker, and urged several reforms on public administration.  Baudeau is said to have descended into mental illness sometime after this, and to have died by suicide (throwing himself out of the window of a sanitorium around 1792).

Otto Bauer, 1881-1938.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/ottobauer.htm," One of the ablest ""Austro-Marxist"" theoreticians, the Viennese Otto Bauer is best known for his version of the Marxian theory of ""crises"", first articulated in his 1904 Neue Zeit article.  In his classic 1907 work, Otto Bauer analyzed the connection between nationalism and class conflict.  Bauer's 1912 article in the Neue Zeit is perhaps his most famous work, detailing the Marxian scheme of ""expanded reproduction"" with increasing organic composition of capital (later taken up by Henryk Grossman).  In his 1926 book, Bauer severely criticized Kautsky's agrarian policy.  About 1907, Otto Bauer became the leader of the left wing of the Austrian Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and founded (with Karl Renner), the Austro-Marxist journal, Der Kampf.   He served in the early Austrian governments of 1918-19 as foreign secretary.   In the latter part of his life, Bauer would consistently defend the Austro-Marxist idea of ""gradual"" revolution against the more radical proposition of immediate, Russian-style revolution (e.g. 1923).  His latter works (1931, 1936) examined the role of class conflict in the rise of Fascism and post-war capitalism.  Bauer was exiled from Austria after 1934, and eventually died in Paris.

Peter Thomas Bauer, 1915-2002,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bauer.htm," Budapest-born Pieter Tamás (later Peter Thomas) Bauer moved from Hungary to England in 1934, to study at Caius College, Cambridge.  After a stint working the private sector merchant bank with activities in Asia, Bauer took up an appointment at the L.S.E, carving out a career a leading development economist with quite radical laissez-faire instincts.  P.T. Bauer taught at the L.S.E. from 1960 to 1983,  whereupon he was made a life peer.  One of the grandees of economic development theory, P.T. Bauer nonetheless seemed immune from the influence of his peers - particularly on the role of government intervention in development. Bauer's thesis was unique at the time: he did not dispute the structuralist thesis that Third World countries were not merely 20th Century versions of 19th Century Europe. Bauer agreed that they had distinct structural features of their own which were brought about by their coexistence with industrialized world, but he identified these features not in trade-induced dependency, but rather in the inheritance of European-style large, bureaucratic, dirigiste states. Structural problems in development were, in Bauer's view, the result of state interference. The only sense in which trade is malign, Bauer argued, was in that its gains were diverted to state coffers and not to the private sector. Private entrepreneurs, he felt, were the engines of development and are very capable, in the Third World as much as the First, to engender development. It was states - Neo-Colonial and otherwise - that were hampering them and thus development as a whole. Western aid, Bauer argues, merely enables dirigiste governments to continue their destructive policies for years on end. Unfortunately, Bauer's polemical tone -- often disparaging of the achievements of Third World countries and exalting Western civilization and its benign effects on the Third World -- have not given him much of an audience in the countries where his propositions might matter most.

William J. Baumol, 1922-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/baumol.htm," Pioneering Neoclassical economist. William J. Baumol was born in New York City, the son of Polish-Lithuanian immigrants.  His parents' Marxist proclivities introduced the young Baumol to economics at an early age.. William J. Baumol enrolled at City College (CUNY) in 1939, obtaining his B.A. in 1942.  In his memoirs, Baumol retrospectively credits his fellow students at CCNY, more than his teachers, for his education.  After a brief stint in the US Department of Agriculture, Baumol enlisted in the US Army, serving in Europe during WWII.  After the war, and another brief stint at the USDA,  Baumol decided to pursue his graduate studies. He moved to London and enrolled in the LSE.  He fell in immediately with the Robbins circle and the ""New Welfare economics"" movement.   He was promptly employed as a lecturer at the LSE and contributed a couple of articles on community indifference curves to the RES.  Baumol obtained his Ph.D. from LSE in 1949, with a thesis on externalities (pub. 1952).  His LSE course notes on economic dynamics was turned into a book in 1951. In 1949, Baumol moved back to the United States  to take up an appointment at Princeton University.  Baumol would remain at Princeton for the greater part of his career until reitrement in 1992.  Baumol also became associated with the C.V. Starr center at NYU.        Major works of William J. Baumol   Resources on William Baumol   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Cesare Beccaria, 1738-1794,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/beccaria.htm," Cesare Marchese di Beccaria Bonesana (often simplified to ""Cesare Beccaria"") was a Milanese nobleman, Enlightenment philosopher and one of the fathers of utilitarianism and the Italian economic tradition.   The Beccaria (archaically Beccheria) were an illustrious aristocratic family of Lombardy.  During the Middle Ages, the Beccaria were leaders of the Ghibelline faction inside Pavia and close allies of the Visconti lords of Milan.  It is historically coincident that Cesare di Beccaria Bonesana was born in Milan in 1738, a product of the marriage of Gian Saverio Marquis of Beccaria Bonesana and Maria Visconti. Between 1746 and 1754 Beccaria was educated at the Collegio dei Nobili in Parma run by Jesuits, receiving what he would later describe as ""a fanatical education"". He went on to study law at the University of Pavia, obtaining his degree in 1758, but his primary interests were in mathematics and natural sciences. After returning to Milan, Beccaria married Teresa Blasco. Beccaria soon fell in with a group of aristocratic young Milanese intellectuals, which included the brothers Pietro Verri and Alessando Verri, Luigi Lambertenghi, and Alfonso Longo.  The young men imbibed the spirit of the Enlightenment, emanating from France, that had reached Milan by this time, and saw themselves as its propagators.  In 1761, they founded the ""Società dei Pugni"" (""Society of the Fists""), a convivial discussion group, to explore ideas about political, social, legal and economic reform.  From 1764 to 1766, the group published the great Enlightenment journal, Il Caffè, where Beccaria and Verri published some of their most famous pieces.  Beccaria's interest in economics were primarily formed by his reading of Montesquieu and Hume. Beccaria's  first publication (1762) was on monetary reform.  Beccaria argued that the value of goods is in inverse proportion to their quantity and the number of sellers and in direct proportion of competing buyers, of the tax, of the labor force and of the importance of transport (a formula later taken up by Verri).  In a brief 1764 note in Il Caffè, Beccaria analyzed the relationship between tariffs and smuggling. Beccaria argued that higher duties increased the incentive to smuggle, thereby leading to a reduction in tariff revenue.  His more extensive Elementi (written in 1769, but published only in 1804), were very much influenced by Cantillon. Beccaria was one of the main developers of the Italian tradition in economics, combining a utilitarian theory of statecraft and a demand-and-supply theory of value (anticipating the Marginalist Revolution).   Outside of economics, Beccaria's most famous work was his 1764 treatise on criminal justice (De delittie e delle pene). Beccaria denounces torture, secret accusations, judicial arbitrariness, inequality in sentencing, and disprortionality between crime and sentence.   Beccaria argued that the punishment of criminals should be assessed according to the amount of damage to ""social welfare"", measured in terms of the utilitarian ""greatest happiness for the greatest number"" principle (taking a cue from Helvetius).  On this criteria, Beccaria argued that punishment must have a preventive rather than punitive function, and consequently trials must be public and fair. Beccaria's tract turned him into a celebrity across Europe overnight. Abbé André Morellet promptly translated it into French, and Voltaire wrote an extended commentary on it.  Beccaria was invited to France, but  without his Milanese friends, it was not a success.  Over-awed by the philosophes he idolized, the socially awkward and shy Beccaria did not make much of an impression in the Parisian salons, and returned to Italy after merely three weeks. Later, Jeremy Bentham would be much influenced by Beccaria's work.   From 1771, Beccaria was appointed to various positions in the Austrian administration in Milan, and was an economic advisor to the Hapsburg government.  Morphing into a bureaucrat, Beccaria did not write much in the latter part of his life.  Beccaria's silence fed rumors in Enlightenment circles that he was being prevented from writing, or that his writings were being withheld by Austrian censors, but there is no evidence of this.  It seems Beccaria simply disliked being a celebrity and voluntarily gave up the literary life.

Johann Joachim Becher, 1625-1685.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/becher.htm," German alchemist/chemist, physician and inventor, best known for the development of the ""phlogiston"" theory of combustion.  Included here for his contributions to early German Cameralism. Son of a Lutheran minister in Speyer, J.J. Becher was orphaned early and struggled to support his remaining family in the midst of the hardships of the Thirty Years' War.  A voracious auto-dictat with wide-interests, J.J. Becher began publishing early and often. His publications earned him the counsel of powerful men and was briefly a professor of medicine at Mainz.  Despite the ridicule that often greeted his schemes and ideas that ranged from the bizarre (e.g. a perpetual motion machine, a 10,000 word ""universal language"", extracting gold from sand, phlogiston, etc.) to the visionary (e.g. a Rhine-Danube canal, a Guyanese colony, factory schemes and trading companies), Becher continued his frantic work pace.  His controversial ideas and frequently poor character traits - a short temper and penchant for embezzlement - often strained his connections, but he was perhaps one of the most brilliant of the early Cameralists. Early on, Becher advised the Elector Palatine on factory schemes and then the Elector of Bavaria on administration.  His call for strict state controls on the flow of goods and services, the dismantling of the guilds and and establishment of chartered trading companies earned him the enmity of the merchant communities of Munich, and he was run out of the land as a result.  Becher subsequently made his way to Mainz, where he took up a position teaching medicine and as the personal physician of the Archbishop.   But his ideas had gained interest elsewhere.  In 1666, Becher was invited to the court of Emperor Leopold I in Vienna, eager to resume reconstruction of the war-battered Hapsburg states. Envisioning that commerce and cities were going to drive the new Hapsburg state, Becher took up the position of Comercienrath and helped organize the central Kommerzkollegium (Commerce Commission).  Eager to apply the lessons of Anglo-Dutch Mercantilism, Becher was instrumental in the foundation of the Orientalische Handelskompanie (Oriental Trading Company) in 1667, which began the importation of the first coffee beans to Vienna from Constantinople. Becher also helped establish the first private silk manufactory in Austria at Walpersdorf in 1666 (failed 1682).  It was around this time that Becher produced his principle Cameralistic works, the Regeln (1667) and the, especially, the Politischer Discurs (1668). Here Becher emphasized the importance of artisans and manufacturing, underlined the importance of consumption in sustaining an economy and the evil of foreign imports.  He also articulated Mercantilist ideas on charter trading companies that can avoid the errors of  'monopolium' and polypolium' (unrestricted competition).

Departing from Vienna soon after, Becher served as a physician to the Elector of Bavaria. In 1669, he interested the Count of Hanau in a scheme for a proposed colony Guinea (for which he secured hereditary title and proposed a High German Trading Company). In 1670, he returned to Vienna, in the position of chemist and advisor to the Emperor Leopold I and to oversee the progress of his silk company.  In 1672, Becher set up a wool factory in Linz, in 1676 he founded the Manufacturhaus, a gigantic textile workhouse for vagabonds in Tabor (Bohemia), and founded the Kunst- und Werkhaus, a model workshop in Vienna, where foreign masters would be brought in to teach Austrian artisans. He eventually wore out his welcome in the Viennese court . Around 1678, made his way to Holland (c.1678), to promote a new silk manufacturing process and strange enterprise for creating gold from sea sand.  But, pursued by political enemies, in 1680, Becher abruptly sailed across to England, and then made his way up to Scotland to study mines.  He died in London in 1682. Brecher's Oriental Trading Company and his Kunst- und Werkhaus were folded in 1683, with resumption of war and the Ottoman siege of Vienna.  Wilhelm von Schröder succeeded Becher as director of the Tabor Manufacturhaus.  J.J. Becher was the brother-in-law of Philipp von Hornick.      Major Works of Johann Becher   Resources on J.J.

Edward W. Bemis, 1860-1930,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bemis.htm,"  American Institutionalist and urban economist. Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, Edward Webster Bemis obtained his B.A. from Amherst College in 1880 and served briefly as a journalist in Minneapolis.  He went on to graduate study in economics at the Johns Hopkins University, receiving his Ph.D. in 1885, under Richard T. Ely. Active in Ely's AEA and an enthusiast for extension lectures, Bemis went on the extension circuit, and eventually was appointed adjunct professor at Vanderbilt University in 1889.  In 1892, Bemis joined the faculty at the newly-founded University of Chicago, to lecture on economics in its extension division. Nonetheless, Bemis was dismissed in 1895 by Chicago president Harper, notionally for incompetence, but also for Bemis's public criticism of railway owners (many of whom were university trustees and donors) in the aftermath of the Pullman strike. After a period in Illinois, Bemis became a professor at Kansas State in 1897, but left in 1899 to join the public sector.  In 1901, Bemis became superintendent of water works for the city of Cleveland, Ohio.  In 1909,  he moved to New York City, to work as deputy commissioner on public works, consulting with a variety of other cities and commissions.  Like Ely, Edward W. Bemis was frequently thought of as a strident socialist.  His principal cause was the nationalization of public works companies by municipalities, although he also embraced other ""progressive"" causes, such as trade unions and immigration restrictions. In a series of lectures in 1887, followed up by articles in the Andover Review, 1888, Bemis was the first to propose the device of literacy tests which he calculated would exclude half of the immigrants arriving in America.  Bemis's proposal was endorsed by Richmond Mayo-Smith, and taken up by politicians like Henry Cabot Lodge and the Immigration Restriction League (f.1894), the literacy test bill passed congress in 1896 but was vetoed by President Grover Cleveland (it was eventually instituted in 1917).

Bishop George Berkeley, 1685-1753.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/berkeley.htm," Irish philosopher, clergymen, and reformer, of notable Tory persuasion. George Berkeley was born to a notable Anglo-Irish family in Kilkenny and educated at Trinity College Dublin, earning his master's degree in 1707, and remaining as a tutor and junior fellow, writing his first few works on mathematics.  Berkeley's principal claim to fame is probably his youthful work in empiricist metaphysics - most famously the  idealist epistemology laid out in his  Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710). He conflated Locke's primary and secondary qualities into mere ""ideas"" thus reduced all human knowledge into mental interpretations.   It is to Berkeley whom we owe that tiresome question of the existence of the tree falling unobserved in the forest .  It was not understood or well-received at the time, and subjected to some derision, but proved to be greatly significant (it was in radicalizing Berkeley that David Hume made his philosophical debut.)   Other works in this vein include the Three Dialogues (1713), the Latin De Motu (1721) and the maturer Theory of Vision (1733) Berkeley was ordained Church of Ireland (Anglican) deacon of Trinity College chapel in 1709, and sometime after (uncertain when) took priestly vows. In 1711, he produced his Passive Obedience, a tract defending the notion that it was a Christian duty to obey supreme civil power unflinchingly.  It was his first foray in what can be characterized as High Toryism, and may have been motivated as an answer to Locke's treatises on government. Berkeley took a leave of absence from Trinity and left Ireland in 1713 making for London, where he was introduced by fellow Irish philosophe Jonathan Swift to the leading intellectual and literary figures of the Augustan age. Berkeley wrote several articles for Richard Steele's The Guardian, principally satires against 'free-thinkers' (fashionable atheists).  Berkeley's Three Dialogues (1713) were an attempt to restate his Treatise in the form of Augustan wit, hoping thereby for a little more success.  In late 1713, Berkeley accompanied Charles Mordaunt, Earl of Peterborough through France and Italy, on the way to Sicily, where the earl was to take up his position as British ambassador.  But Queen Anne's sudden death in 1714 cut that trip short. With the political turmoil of the transition, Berkeley found his Tory connections profitless, and was even suspected of being a Jacobite sympathizer.  Berkeley readily took up an opportunity to undertake another European tour in 1715, this time as tutor to the young St. George Ashe.  This tour would last until 1720, and was spent principally in Italy.  Towards the end of that journey, he composed a Latin treatise, De Motu, attempting to apply his idealist philosophy to science, principally motion.  Berkeley arrived in England in late 1720 just in time for the unraveling of the South Sea Bubble.  His Essay toward Preventing the Ruin of Great Britain (1721) was written as an alarmist  piece of Tory social commentary.  The disenchanted Berkeley blamed the crisis as a natural outcome of the easy money, recklessness, corruption and general moral decadence of early Hanoverian Britain.    He urged a return to simple principles of individual exertion, frugality, religion, public spiritedness, etc. He urged active government involvement in job creation, workhouses and public investment projects, as well as intervention in social life (bachelor taxes, sumptuary laws, regulating art, drama, etc.) to promote public virtue and population growth.  However, Berkeley remained  thoroughly pessimistic about long-term prospects - warning that increased prosperity naturally promoted luxurious tastes, which would likely lead to ruin and depopulation of the country. In late 1721, Berkeley finally returned to Dublin, possibly (initially) as chaplain of Charles FitRoy, Duke of Grafton (the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland), and subsequently the Deanery of Dromore.  He also might have taken a doctor of divinity at Trinity and become senior lecturer at this point.  All that is certain is  that in 1722, Berkeley returned to the academic world and took up the chair of Hebrew Lecturer at Trinity  in 1722 and, a year later, he was surprised to inherit a considerable fortune from a Dutch merchant's widow Vanessa Vanhomrigh, whom Berkeley barely knew (she had briefly been Swift's intimate, and wrote her will in Berkeley's favor possibly to spite Swift). In 1724, Berkeley left Trinity College to take up a substantial appointment as Dean of Derry.  With his financial situation more settled, Berkeley threw himself into a project to establish a Christian college in the Bermudas (1725).  He moved to London to garner support, eventually the project gained parliamentary approval, and a charter for the College of St. Paul was issued, with Berkeley as its first president was issued in 1726.  After marrying in 1728, Berkeley finally set sail with his new wife for the New World to establish the college.  However, it was not to be.  For obscure reasons (accidental or intentional), the ship ended up anchoring in Newport, Rhode Island in early 1729 (Berkeley possibly intended to establish in Newport a support base for his Caribbean college).  Berkeley ended up staying in Rhode Island for three years, setting himself up on a farm and an unusual period of quiet domesticity, ostensibly waiting for pledges for the college to materialize. The project was finally quashed by the prime minister Robert Walpole in 1731 and Berkeley returned to Europe disappointed.  He left his farm (and later sent his library) to Yale college. Soon after arriving in London, Berkeley published his Alciphron (1732), a set of dialogues composed while in Rhode Island against atheistic 'free-thinkers', in various guises, and contained a  subtly-argued defense of Christian spirituality and mysteries.  It provoked a bit of a debate, prompting Berkeley to revisit his old theory of vision (1733) to illustrate its connections to his idealist philosophy.  In these polemics, Berkeley took particular aim at the hedonic ethics of Shaftesbury and the vices-benefits thesis of  Mandeville. The controversy provoked by Alciphron led some commentators to speculate that Berkeley might even hold mathematical knowledge as unsound.  Berkeley decided to address the matter in his polemical Analyst (1734).  Addressed to the royal astronomer and skeptic Edmund Halley, Berkeley challenged mathematics head on, most notably Newton's popular theory of 'fluxions' (differential calculus).  With the ardor of a 'free-thinker', Berkeley sets about uncovering numerous 'gaps in proof', and attacking the use of infinitesimals ('ghosts of departed quantities'), diagonal of the unit square, the infinitely-divisible length, and the very existence of numbers.  These were used to illustrate Berkeley's general point that mathematicians, like Christians, rely on incomprehensible 'mysteries' for the foundations of their reasoning. The certainty of mathematics is no greater than the certainty of religion.  In 1734, George Berkeley was appointed and consecrated as Bishop of Cloyne, in one of the remoter parts of County Cork in southern Ireland.  His first year was spent in follow-up parries with the mathematicians, but he soon turned his inquiries into the social and economic condition of his diocese - particularly the state of the native poor Irish Catholic population (an unusual concern for a planted Anglican bishop).  The result was The Querist, published anonymously in three parts between 1735 and 1737, set in the form of several hundred questions (really, pseudo-questions, for which the reader is expected to answer 'yes' for nearly all of them, and carry the argument).  The queries (esp. Part III) are essentially geared to advocating the creation of an Irish Mint and National Bank (a project earlier floated in parliament, but sunk in 1721). He made Law's doctrine that ""easy money is the engine of trade"" central to his policy conclusions, basing this on his argument that money was effectively only a ""ticket"" for a credit transaction (presaging the ideas of Boisguilbert, Steuart and, much later, H.D. Macleod).  (In a sense, the Querist is yet another demolition of John Locke, whose outsized influence on British thought always grated Berkeley.  Having disposed of Locke's philosophy (1710) and his political theory (1712), this time, Berkeley assaults Locke's metal-focused quantity theory of money.)  The Querist was his principal economics tract.  Berkeley was an opponent of Mandeville's economic-ethical philosophy of 'private vice, public benefits', condemning his Fable in at least two tracts (1732, 1736).  Berkeley's proceeded to lead the life of a near-recluse at Cloyne, emerging only intermittently to attend the house of lords in Dublin.  The Jacobite rebellion of 1745 prompted his Letter to the Catholics and, a few years later, a Word to the Wise (1749) addressing the Catholic clergy and the Maxims concerning Patriotism (1750).  In declining age and health, Berkeley found the medicinal qualities of tar-water helpful, he set about writing several tracts lauding its properties. In 1752, already in grievous health, Berkeley moved to England, to accompany his son, who had enrolled at Oxford.  He died not long after, in early 1753.  Berkeley was buried in Christchurch, Oxford.  George Berkeley is referred to in W.B. Yeats's ""Seven Sages"" as one of the great opponents of 'Whiggery'.  The city of Berkeley, where the flagship campus of  the University of California was established in 1866, was named after him.

Daniel Bernoulli, 1700-1782.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bernoulli.htm,"  Dutch-Swiss mathematician, first articulator of the expected utility hypothesis. Born to a family of mathematicians - his father was Johan Bernoulli, his uncle Jakob Bernoulli and his younger brother Johan II.  Preciously gifted, Daniel's mathematical skill led to an unhealthy rivalry with his father, with the lamentable consequence of  a personal break between the two.  Bernoulli was a close friend of Leonhard Euler.  In 1724, Bernoulli moved to St. Petersburg, Russia to teach mathematics at the new university, but left in 1734. He went on to teach at the university of Basel, Switzerland, for much of the remainder of his life. Bernoulli's principal work in mathematics was his treatise on fluid mechanics, Hydrodynamica.  In economics, Bernoulli is best known for his 1738 article resolving the St. Petersburg paradox, a probability problem set by his cousin Nicholas Bernoulli in 1713, involving the solution to a game of chance with an infinite expected return.  Daniel's proposed solution introduced two revolutionary ideas: (1) the expected utility hypothesis (namely, that people value not the expected money return, but rather the expected utility return), and  (2) the concept of diminishing marginal utility (that utility is an increasing function of money, but at a diminishing rate).  This enabled him to solve for a finite expected utility, and thus solve the paradox.     Major works of Daniel Bernoulli   Resources on Bernoulli All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Eduard Bernstein, 1850-1932.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bernstein.htm," German Social Democratic Party leader and main author of  the ""revisionist"" version of Marxism. A Berlin bank clerk, Eduard Bernstein joined the (Marxian) Social Democratic Worker's Party (SDAP) of Bebel and Liebknectht in 1872.  Bernstein participated in the Gotha Congress which united the Marxian SPAD party and the Lassallian ADAV party into the single Socialist Workers Party (SAP).  When the party was banned and socialist activity restricted in Germany in 1878, Bernstein went into exile to Zurich, Switzerland.  Bernstein moved on to London in 1888, where he remained until 1901.  During this time, he served as the editor of the socialist party newspaper, Der Sozialdemocrat and became a friend and companion of Friedrich Engels and entered into the circle of the Fabian Socialists.  It was particularly the influence of the latter that gave rise to Bernstein's ""revisionist"" views.  However, he would also use his close relationship with Engels to claim that the Marxian leader himself shared his views.  Bernstein remained in London after the socialists were unbanned in Germany in 1890. Bernstein was one of the main authors of the 1891 Marxian-oriented ""Erfurt Program"" for the newly-renamed Social Democratic Party (SPD).  Long a leading light of the Marxian establishment, considered the heir of Engels, Eduard Bernstein astonished friends and the entire movement socialist movement when he came out against the Marxian revolutionary thesis.  Effectively, Bernstein claimed that Marx was mistaken in identifying the revolutionary potential of workers, in predicting their increasing misery and the eventual collapse of capitalism by a proletarian revolution.  The conditions of the working classes, Bernstein observed, are improving, not worsening and the desire or need for revolution is weakening  - something he claimed that Marx himself had acknowledged as a possibility. Edward Bernstein first set out his revisionist views in a series of articles for Die Neue Zeit in 1896 and 1898 which later emerged into his 1899 treatise. Bernstein denied the inevitability of ""class conflict"", the theory of increasing concentration of capital and sudden collapse of capitalism.  As a result, Bernstein argued that Marxian socialists should set their ""revolutionary"" hopes aside, and pursue a more practical, piecemeal movement towards a socialist state within a parliamentary democratic context.  On a more theoretical level, Bernstein stressed the ""idealist"" side of the Hegelian dialectic which he felt Marx had abandoned too quickly.  Later on, imbued with neo-Kantian thinking, he stressed the ethical side of socialism more and more.  He was not a fan of the labor theory of value or the abstract nature of Marxian economics. Bernstein's 1896-99 ideas were bitterly disputed by orthodox Marxians such as Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Kautsky and Vladimir Lenin.   They got the SPD to officially condemn revisionism in 1899, but the debate raged on in the party nonetheless.  Returning to Germany in 1901, he became the  leader  the revisionist faction and expanded its appeal considerably among party members.  In 1902, he was elected in the Reichstag.  Always a pacificst, Bernstein resigned from party because of its support for the German war effort and founded an ""independent"" USPD.  Although also opposed to the ""majority"" SPD, Bernstein did not support the more radical efforts of Rosa  Luxemburg and the Spartacist League.  He rejoined the SPD after the war, served in government briefly in 1919. From 1920 to 1928, Bernstein was a SPD delegate in the Reichstag and one of the more vocal opponents of the rising Nazi party.  He died before they came to power. Throughout this time, SPD remained officially a Marxist party by its Erfurt program, its theory remained ""orthodox"", with ""revisionism"" tolerated only as a minority opinion.  It was only until 1959 where, at a famous Bad Godesburg conference, the SPD formally unloaded its Marxian theory and embraced its identity as a reformist worker's party -- as Bernstein had wanted all along.

Arthur Berry, 1862-1929,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/berry.htm,"English mathematical economist and astronomer.  Originally from Croyden, Arthur Berry studied at UCL and then won a scholarship to King's College, Cambridge.  At Cambridge, Berry studied under Alfred Marshall, and became interested in economics.  However, Berry was a mathematician first and foremost.  He was Senior Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos of 1885, and went on to become lecturer in mathematics and fellow of King's College, Cambridge in 1886.  Berry nonetheless made significant contributions to economics - notably on the theory of distribution (1890) and on Edgeworth's contract curve (1891).   Marshall credits Berry, along with Flux, for assistance with the mathematical appendix of his 1890 Principles. Berry stayed on at Cambridge, working mostly on mathematics and astronomy.

Joseph L.F. Bertrand, 1822-1900.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bertrand.htm," A prominent French mathematician, Joseph Bertrand studied and taught at the École Polytéchnique in Paris.  From 1862 until his death in 1900, Joseph Bertrand held a chair in general physics and mathematics at the prestigious Collège de France. He was also a member of the influential Académie des Sciences, entering in 1856 and becoming its perpetual secretary from 1874.   Bertrand was elected to the Académie française in December 1884. For philosophical reasons, Joseph Bertrand was generally opposed to the application of mathematical reasoning to psychology, sensations, and other elusive components of human behavior.  As a result, he was very dismissive Léon Walras's pretentious claim that economics was merely a branch of applied mathematics.  As he put it once to Walras, it was like ""undertaking the study of hydraulics with muddy liquids.""  In 1875, as a referee for the Revue des Deux Mondes, Bertrand rejected a Walras paper (later published in the Giornale) on this topic. In 1877, Walras sent Bertrand a draft of his Théorie mathématique de la richesse sociale, but Bertrand did not reply.  In 1883, Bertrand finally decided to publish a review of Walras's book in the Journal des Savants.  Although negative in general, Bertrand's review had some kind words for Walras.  Bertrand disputed the realism of the tâtonnement process and argued that out-of-equilibrium exchange must be allowed and thus price indeterminacy.  He also disputed the utility-maximization hypothesis, arguing that merchants were mainly interested in money profits, not utility. In that same 1883 Journal des Savants article, Bertrand took the opportunity to also review the long-neglected 1838 work of Augustin Cournot.  Here, Bertrand's assessment was damning.  He argued that Cournot's work deserved to be neglected because its algebraic argument was faulty and that, as a result, Cournot had reached the wrong conclusions on questions like the incidence of tax on monopoly price, the determinacy of duopoly price and the effects of free trade.  On the constructive side, Bertrand (1883) ""reworked"" the Cournot duopoly model with prices, rather than quantities, as the strategic variables.  In this case, Bertrand showed, prices will be driven immediately down to the perfectly competitive solution.  Later on, F.Y. Edgeworth (1897) drew attention to the limitations of Bertrand's solution, in particular that he relied on firms having no capacity constraints and thus operating under constant marginal cost.  In its stead, Edgeworth introduced capacity constraints and showed that the solution was indeterminate.        Major works of Joseph L.F. Bertrand   Resources on J. L. F.

Lord William H. Beveridge, 1879-1963.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/beveridge.htm," British economist, social reformer and intellectual architect of the post-war welfare state in Great Britain. Born in India and educated in mathematics and classics at Balliol College, Oxford. Intent on a legal career, Beveridge moved to Toynbee Hall, a settlement house in London.  It is while there that he began studying the unemployed, and promoting schemes for relief. Lord Beveridge was so highly influenced by the Fabian Socialists - in particular by Beatrice Potter Webb, with whom he worked on the 1909 Poor Laws report - that he could readily be counted among them. However, he was perhaps the best economist among them - his early work on unemployment (1909) and his massive historical study of prices and wages (1939) being clear testaments of his scholarship. The Fabians made him a director of the London School of Economics in 1919, as post which retained until 1937. His continual jousts with Cannan and Robbins, who were trying to wrench the LSE away from its Fabian roots, are now legendary. After his departure from the LSE, he worked on a particularly famous wartime study which came out in 1942 and has since become known as the ""Beveridge Report"". In short, the Beveridge Report outlined the construction of the modern welfare state - the culmination of the Fabians' project. Once Labour took power in 1945, it set out to legislate it into existence - taking the Beveridge Report as a blueprint. One of its most remarkable assets was the convincing manner of Beveridge's argument which made it so widely acceptable: Beveridge appealed to conservatives and other doubters by arguing that the welfare institutions he proposed would increase the competitiveness of British industry in the post-war period by not only by shifting labor costs like health care and pensions out of corporate ledgers and onto the public account but also by producing healthier, wealthier and thus more motivated and productive workers who would also serve as a great source of demand for British goods.

Jean-Joseph Louis Blanc, 1811-1882.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/blanc.htm,"French journalist, historian, statesman, and founder of the socialist movement. Jean-Joseph Louis Blanc was born in Madrid, Spain.  His father was a old French royalist, who had opposed the French Revolution suffered greatly through the Terror. His mother, Estelle de Pozzo Borgo, was Corsican, and had a role in reconciling  her husband with Napoleon's empire.  Blanc's father was stationed in Spain as Inspector-General of Finances under Joseph Bonaparte, when Louis was born.  The family returned to France during the Bourbon restoration.  While his parents were in Paris living on a small state pension, Louis was educated at a royal college in Rodez. Blanc's father mis-stepped politically again during the July Revolution of 1830,  opposing the rise of Louis-Philippe and adhering to the legitimist cause of the senior branch of the house of Bourbon.  Their pension was promptly severed, and the family fell into financial desperation.  Louis, who had begun studying law, had to make his own way, earning a pittance as minor clerk in a law office and giving private lessons on the side. In 1832, he accepted a position as private tutor to the Halette family, a manufacturer in Arras. His close-up observations and interaction with workmen in his Halette's factory sowed the seeds of his interest in conditions of labor, then being thrown into disarray with the arrival of the industrial revolution into France. In 1834, Louis Blanc returned to Paris, intent on a journalistic career.  He worked for various newspapers, eventually making his way to editor of the Bon Sens in 1837. Blanc increasingly wrote about labor conditions, and complained of the impact of capitalist competition.  His increasingly radical tone brought him into conflict with the paper's proprietors.  He was finally fired from the Bon Sens for advocating state-owned railways (instead of private). In 1839, Blanc launched his own journal, the Revue du Progrès (initially fortnightly, later monthly) Blanc let his pen flow unconstrained, with pleas for improvement of the plight of laborers, denunciations of the privileges of the French nobility, the corruption of the Orleanist government and the indifference of the capitalist bourgeoisie. Around this time, Blanc wrote his Histoire de dix ans, a condemnation of the Orleanist regime in the form of a narrative history. A series of articles in the Revue in August 1840 were compiled and re-printed as a separate pamphlet, L'Organisation du travail in September 1840, sometimes considered the founding blueprint of the socialist movement.  In it, Blanc denounced the harshness of market competition and called for stricter labor regulations,  state-ownership of the larger industries, and organization of national workshops as steps towards the eventual wholesale elimination of private capitalism and the market wage system, and its substitution by a ""universal association"" geared towards the needs of workers.  Blanc would later distill this collectivist socialist ideal into the famous epigrammatic phrase  ""from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs"" (""à chacun selon ses besoins, de chacun selon ses facultés"", 1851, p.92).  Blanc's tract was a sensation - and ground-breaking.  It had little in common with prior utopian socialist ideas of Sismondi, Fourier or Cabet. Louis Blanc was more clearly observant of the large-scale and deep social and economic changes wrought by the industrial revolution and ferocious in his conclusions.. Blanc almost single-handedly converted the republican leaders and the rebellious Parisian masses to the socialist cause.  Blanc's repeated calls for state-fostered industrial employment via producer cooperatives that would eventually replace private industry, echoed with the unemployed during the economic slump of the late 1840s..  Blanc criticized prior schemes for worker cooperatives, that urged workers to set these up themselves  (as concurrently promoted by, e.g. L'Atelier). Blanc believed that worker associations should not compete but have a monopoly in each trade, and looked to the State to provide the means to implement it . These socialist schemes caught the imagination of the republican movement in France during the 1840s. Radical republicans of La Réforme (Ledru-Rollin, Flocon etc.) shared Blanc's comprehensive vision, while moderates of Le National preferred the piecemeal version of the L'Atelier. But by 1846, there was general agreement to merge political republicanism and economic socialism in some form.    The chance to put it into practice suddenly appeared during the February, 1848 revolution.  Rots in Paris led to collapse of the July Monarchy and the abdication of Louis-Philippe.  Two days later, on February 26, the Second French Republic was declared, and a provisional government established by the moderate Alphonse Lamartine.  That same day, Louis Blanc declared the creation of a provisional socialist government, but was ordered by the National Assembly to merge with Lamartine's government.  Although Lamartine famously rejected a red flag presented to him, he accepted a socialist petition enshrining the principles of  ""guaranteed work for all male citizens"", ""assured minimum to any worker's family in case of disability or sickness"" and a right to ""organization of labor"". Although the February Revolution would inspire a myriad of similar uprisings and revolutions across Europe that same year - the ""Springtime of the Peoples""  - the French one went furthest in trying to implement economic transformation to accompany the political changes.    On February 28, the provisional government proclaimed the establishment of a ""national labor commission"", under the presidency of Louis Blanc and his deputy ""Albert the Worker"" (Alexandre Martin) . It was supposed to implement a scheme for ""national workshops"" (ateliers nationaux) for each trade in France, to absorb the unemployed and fulfill the guaranteed work promise. Blanc's commission, consisting of delegates from the various trades, was set up in the old Chamber of Peers in the Luxembourg Palace.  It would serve effectively as a parallel industrial parliament for the next few months - where workers and artisans would debate the rapid economic changes in the country.  In some sense, Blanc lost control of the process, as the conclusions of the Luxembourg commission were not always in the socialist direction..  Tradesmen complained about high wages, price controls, work conditions, unionization, restrictions on machinery and competition from sub-contractors, unskilled workers and women.    The national workshops scheme were also having birthing problems - oversubscribed and suspected by many of the unemployed.  Blanc disagreed with their design, and eventually disowned the national workshops that were set up. Although universal suffrage was introduced, the radical republicans and socialists fared poorly in the elections of April, 1848, much to their surprise. Nonetheless, the left-wing political ""clubs"" in Paris, which had sprouted earlier that year - most famously the radical communist club of Louis Auguste Blanqui, the  similarly revolutionary club of his rival Armand Barbès, and the more utopian Owenite socialist/Icarian communist club of Étienne Cabet - were not quite prepared to see the liberal bourgeoisie hijack and reverse ""their"" revolution. On May 15, the clubs banded together, stormed the National Assembly, and elected a new radical left government on the spot, including Louis Blanc among their ministers. The ""red"" coup attempt did not succeed - the National Guard surrounded the assembly building, and promptly arrested all the club leaders. Louis Blanc, who had not participated in these events, was not arrested, but was placed under severe pressure in the aftermath.  Blanc was indicted by a parliamentary commission and although he was acquitted, his Luxembourg commission was shut down, for 'spreading the poison"" that led to the red surge.  A commission of inquiry was set up to investigate the National Workshops, and concluded they were over-expensive, a breeding ground for agitation and a ""threat to the social order"".  The National Assembly finally disbanded the workshops on June 20.  Demonstrations promptly followed, and barricades were up across the eastern half of Paris by June 23.  By all accounts, this was spontaneously organized by the working classes of Paris, many of them former employees of the National Workshops.  Most of the left wing leaders had already been arrested or cowed by the May crackdown.  Blanc's proposals to negotiate with the workers was shouted down in the National Assembly.  Louis Blanc personally pleaded with the insurgents to stand down, and not give the forces of reaction the opportunity to crush the remaining gains of the revolution, but to no avail. An inevitable but very bloody confrontation followed, as units of the police, army and National Guard assaulted the barricades one by one. The fighting continued for several days, and round-ups and suppression continued in the aftermath.  Estimates of the death toll range from 900 to Marx's estimate of 3,000.  Arrests ran up to 12,000.  However, unlike in 1871, there were no systematic executions in reprisal - half the prisoners were released within days, most of the rest over the next couple of years, and only a few hundred deported to penal colonies for long-term sentences. In the aftermath of the June Days insurrection, Louis Blanc found his position decidedly uncomfortable. He was personally blamed by other delegates, including former supporters, for setting the Second Republic on the course to this collision.  At length finding the situation untenable, Blanc departed France and moved to England, where he would for the next two decades.  In exile in London, Blanc would write several memoirs of the 1848 revolution (notably his Revelations of 1858, which he expanded into his 1870 Histoire).   He also continued commenting on events in France, as well as collecting observations on industrial England.  Blanc also wrote tracts against the Second Empire of Louis Napoleon.  Blanc's works after 1852 were banned from entry into France.  In the 1850s, Blanc also composed a twelve-volume history of the 1789 French Revolution and finally got married, in 1865, to an Englishwoman. Louis Blanc's ideas and schemes would be taken up by German socialists, like Ferdinand Lassalle and Karl Marx.  In his later years, Blanc gradually curbed his radicalism, calling only for State involvement in social programs and income redistribution.  After the fall of Napoleon III, Blanc returned to France in 1870 and was was elected to the National Assembly of the Third Republic. Blanc refused to endorse the Paris Commune of 1871, but pleaded for an amnesty for the communards in the aftermath.  He died in December 1882, and was buried with state honors at Pere Lachaise in Paris.

Adolphe Blanqui, 1798-1854.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/adolpheblanqui.htm," Economist of the French Liberal School and head of the École de Commerce in Paris.  Son of a magistrate from Nice, Jerome Adolphe Blanqui was educated at Nice and then pursued his higher studies in Paris from 1814.  Adolphe is the older brother of the socialist revolutionary, Louis-Auguste Blanqui, who was active in both the 1830 and 1848 revolutions (thus Adolphe Blanqui is often referred to as ""Blanqui aîné"").   Adolphe Blanqui began as an instructor at l'Institution Massin, teaching chemistry and pharmacology.  He came into contact with Jean-Baptiste Say, who encouraged him to study economics, and helped him secure a chair in History and Industrial Economy at the École de Commerce in 1825.  In 1830, he became the director of the  École.  In 1833,  Blanqui succeeded Say in the professorship in political economy at Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers in Paris in 1833.  Blanqui was elected a member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques in 1836. Adolphe Blanqui's Histoire (1837), is one of the first comprehensive histories of economic thought.  His lectures at the École and the Conservatoire in the late 1830s were widely attended.  His lecture notes published by his students.  Blanqui was a close follower of Adam Smith and J.B. Say, and a leading member of the French Liberal School.  He was one of the founders of the Journal des économistes in 1841 and an editor of the Dictionnaire.  Blanqui had an active interest in the budding industrial revolution.  He traveled extensively, throughout France, England, Italy, Spain, Germany, Serbia, Bulgaria, etc., compiling observations about industrial development and economic systems. In 1840, he delivered one of the first economic reports on Algeria (which had been conquered by France in 1830), and an  report on the French working class in 1848.  Towards the end of his life, Blanqui had undertaken an extensive three-year study for the Academie on French agricultural labor, but died before he deliver his report. Blanqui served as deputy in the French parliament between 1846 and 1848.      Major Works of Adolphe Blanqui      Resources on J.A. Blanqui   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Gerolamo Boccardo, 1829-1904.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/boccardo.htm," Italian economist, geographer, teacher and politician. Originating from Genoa, Gerolamo Boccardo studied law at the University of Genoa. His student years were interrupted by involvement in political activities. He was involved with the Società Entellica in Chiavari (a hotbed of risorgimento nationalists) and a journalist for the Corriere Mercante of Genoa. He participated in the 1848 uprising in Milan.

After getting around to completing his law degree, Boccardo was appointed as a teacher in the Collegio Nazionale in Genoa, where he was assigned to teach commercial law. Boccardo deepened his study of economics during this period, and in 1853 published his Trattato, a syncretic work, loosely based on the classicism of Mill and the French Liberals. Boccardo's treatise, widely disseminated in Italy, made his reputation.  Boccardo was invited to a variety of political and administrative posts, which he usually turned down, preferring to remain a teacher  (although he remained an advisor to the Genoa city council for much of his life).. In 1858, Boccardo became central director of the technical schools in the city of Genoa, and teacher in industrial economics. In 1860, he was invited to take the chair in political economy in the law school of the University of Genoa.  He would go on to author numerous manuals on economics, law, geography, administration and other topics for secondary and technical schools. Boccardo was also an encyclopedist.  In the aftermath of his Trattato, Boccardo compiled a monumental  Dizionario of economics.  He also went on to edit the more general Nuova Enciclopedia Italiana.  In 1876, Boccardo succeeded Ferrara as editor of the series Biblioteca dell' Economista, providing Italian translations of various non-Italian works. For the series, Boccardo broke with Ferrara's orthdox classical emphasis, and included volumes on the German Historical School and socialists (including the first Italian translation of Marx's Capital). Significantly, Bocardo also supervised translations of the works of Cournot, Jevons and Walras (1876), and authored a preface much lauding the new approach.  As such, Boccardo is partly responsible for introducing the marginalist revolution to Italy.  Like Jevons, Boccardo also developed a sunspot theory of the business cycle (1879, 1904). In 1877, Boccardo was nominated as Senator of Italy and finally left his beloved Genoa for Rome.  In 1878, he became a member of the prestigious Academia del Lincei.  He was appointed to the Council of State in 1888.  He passed the direction of the Biblioteca over to Cognetti di Martis in 1892.

Jean Bodin, 1530-1596.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bodin.htm,"  Jean Bodin (or Baudin or Bodinus) was a 16th Century French jurist, natural law philosopher and precursor of Mecantilism.  Born in Angers to a prosperous artisan family of Jewish origins, Jean Bodin studied and taught Roman law at the university in Toulouse (around the time when Navarrus was there), before becoming a lawyer in Paris around 1561.  Yet Bodin was no stale professional.  He had a varied and insatiable intellectual curiosity, reading practically everything he could get his hands on.  His first love, history, led to his 1566 tract on the philosophy of history.   Bodin's interest in economics was provoked by Malestroict writings, which laid forth the standard argument that the Europe-wide inflation raging at the time was due to debasement of currency and clipping.  In his 1568 tract, Bodin did not dispute that these activities could cause inflation, but Bodin wanted to pin the blame on the Peruvian silver pouring into Europe through Spain.  Bodin noticed that clipping, debasement and imports of silver had a common feature: they all increased the amount of money relative to goods.  Consequently, Bodin put forth what is generally acknowledged as one of the first statements of the Quantity Theory of Money, detailing the relationship between price levels and the money supply, generally speaking.  Because money flows in the opposite direction of goods, Bodin recognized that exports of goods increased prices while imports lowered them.  Thus, the quintessential Mecantilist foreign trade policy formula was already implicit in Bodin's work: if you want to bring prices up, run a favorable balance of trade.  Bodin himself was generally favorably-disposed towards free trade, believing it stabilized prices, helped bring nations together and promoted peace.  Bodin also articulated a plan for a government-run commodity buffer stock scheme to stabilize wheat prices and an international agreement for monetary standards.  He was, however, completely opposed to the lifting of the ban on usury. In 1571, Bodin entered the service of the king's brother, the Duke of Alençon (later Anjou), and accompanied him to England (it was in the court of Queen Elizabeth I that Bodin was almost made a jester).  In 1576-7, Bodin served as a delegate of the Third Estate in the Estates-General of Blois.  Bodin threw his political lot in with Michel d'Hôpital, whose politiques faction was trying to construct a ""third way"" between the extremists of the Catholic Holy League and the Calvinist Union.  Bodin urged for negotiations with the Calvinists rather than resumption of the religious wars and he opposed the sale of the monarchy's lands to raise funds for any such endeavor.   It was during the height of his active political involvement that Bodin composed his celebrated Six Books (1576), wherein he expounded his famous theory of sovereignty, which were in many ways consonant with the political positions he had expounded at the Estates-General.   In 1580, he wrote a demonology ""handbook"" for judges at witchcraft trials. However, Bodin badly misjudged the fanatical spirit of the time.   The religious wars were stepped up and the politiques, Bodin included, were squeezed out of royal favor.  In the political whirlwind which followed, Bodin was accused of atheism (not unlikely -- he embraced a kind of rational spiritualism in his posthumously published 1588 tract).  Bodin decided to duck the whole tumult by quietly retiring to a prosecutorship in Laon in 1583.  However, in 1588, after Catholic troops captured the town, Bodin prudently switched his allegiance to the Holy League.  He welcomed the ascendancy of Henry IV and the restoration of the politiques in 1594 -- but, now, being officially in with the fanatics, Bodin was not asked to return.  He died of the plague in Laon.       Major Works of Jean Bodin   Resources on Jean Bodin All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Boëthius, c.480-524,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/boethius.htm," Late Roman philosopher and civil servant in Ostrogoth Italy during the Dark Ages. Born in Rome shortly after the fall of the western Roman empire. Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius originated from a notable family from Praeneste (Palestrina) in Latium.  His father, who had been consul in 487, died early. The orphaned Boethius was raised by Symmachus, an aristocratic friend of his father, who supplied him a Classical education, including a thorough knowledge of Greek works.. Boethius eventually married Symmachus's daughter and with his patronage,  Boethius followed a distinguished career in the civil service of the Ostrogoth kingdom of Italy.   Boethius himself served as consul in 510.  Boethius reached the height of his power in 522, when he was appointed magister officium, head of the civil service of Theodoric the Great, Ostrogoth king of Italy.  That same year,  Boethius's own sons served jointly as consuls for 522.   But Boethius fell from grace quickly in 523.  Accused of treason by Theodoric the Great, Boethius was arrested and imprisoned.  Symmachus attempted to defend his son-in-law, but was himself implicated and arrested. Boetheius wrote his major work, Consolation of Philosophy, a fusion of Classical and Christian ethics and philosophy, while in prison in Pavia.  Boethius was executed in 524.  The fall of Boethius opened the door to Cassiodorus, who assumed the magister office after him Earlier in his life, Boethius had determined to translate the works of the Classical Greek philosophers, Plato and Aristotle in an effort to prove both their philosophies were compatible with each other. He never accomplished the object.  Boethius's Latin translations of two of Aristotle's logical works - the Categories and Interpretation (two versions - one for beginners, another for advanced students), and his translation of Porphyry's Introduction (to the Categories) with Boethius's commantaries - constitute the Vetus Logica (Old Logic), the  sum total knowledge of Aristotle available in Europe until the 12th C.  Upon this thin layer was based all early Medieval Scholastic logic, including the endless disputations between 'Realism' and 'Nominalism'.  Three more of Boethius's translations of Aristotle's logical works (Prior Analytics, Topics and Sophistical Refutations) were rediscovered only in 1120.

Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, 1851-1914.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bawerk.htm," Austrian economist, statesman, leading member of the Austrian School and creator of the Austrian theory of capital. Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk (Boehm-Bawerk, sometimes shortened to just Böhm) originated from a prominent family in Brünn (Brno), then part of the Austro-Hungarian province of Moravia. Hs studied at the local schools in Brünn before enrolling at the University of Vienna, where he came under the influence of Carl Menger.   Böhm-Bawerk was in Vienna when Menger published his revolutionary Grundsätze, launching the Marginalist Revolution and the ""Austrian School"".  It was also at Vienna that Böhm-Bawerk met his comrade, colleague and future brother-in-law, Friedrich von Wieser.

After obtaining his law degree in law from Vienna in 1872, Böhm-Bawerk joined the finance section of the Austrian civil service, while continuing his economic studies on the side, completing his doctorate in 1875. Böhm-Bawerk (along with Wieser) proceeded to study economics further at  universities of Heidelberg, Leipzig and Jena, attending the lectures of Karl Knies, Wilhelm  Roscher and Bruno Hildebrand, the leaders of the German Historical School. After submitting his habilitation at Vienna in 1880 (pub.1881), Böhm-Bawerk embarked on an academic career, taking up a job as associate (extraordinary) professor at the University of Innsbruck in 1880.  It was during this time that he produced the first two volumes of magnum opus, Capital und Capitalzins. He resigned his chair in 1889 and returned to the Ministry of Finance in Vienna, where he led a section on tax reform. In 1895, Böhm-Bawerk was appointed Minister of Finance in the Austrian government of Kielmansegge, but held this only briefly. He became minister of finance again from November 1897 to March 1898 (Gautsch cabinet), then a third time from 1900 to 1904 (Körber cabinet).   Although a classical liberal, and associated with the liberal societies, he was not a formal member of any political party.

In 1904, Böhm-Bawerk returned to academia,  succeeding to Menger's chair as professor of political economy at the University of Vienna.  Over the next decade, alongside Wieser, Böhm-Bawerk presided over the education of the next generation of Austrian economists, including Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich von Hayek and Joseph Schumpeter among his students.  Böhm-Bawerk died in 1914. Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk is best for his three volume work, Capital und Capitalzins, introducing what has become characterized as the Austrian theory of capital.  It was begun largely in response to Karl Marx's challenge to the Classical theory of interest.   Böhm-Bawerk's first volume (""History and Critique"", 1884) reviewed various theories of interest, and agreed that interest could not be based on cost (discarding the Senior-Mill theory of abstinence), and posited instead that interest must rest on the superiority of future goods over present goods - what he called the agio. He contemplated various possible reasons for it (including time preference).  This was developed in more detail in his second volume, ""Positive Theory of Capital"" (1889), where he decided to rest it on the productivity of time.  Picking up from where J.H. Thünen, John Rae and W.S. Jevons left off, Böhm-Bawerk characterized capital as time, a ""roundabout"" process of investment into labor and land. Crudely put, the more investment (i.e. time) put into building tools and equipment, the greater the resulting output. As roundabout production is more productive than direct simple production, time has a productivity dimension all its own, thus providing the justification for interest. Böhm-Bawerk tried to quantify this by proposing the ""Average Period of Production"" (APP). Böhm-Bawerk's work was quickly translated into English by  William T. Smart, and helped introduce the Austrian School (and indeed the Marginalist Revolution) to American economics.  But the theory of capital itself was immediately criticized by John Bates Clark, who had his own competing theory of capital.  This led to a series of polemics in US journals in the 1890s.  The Austrian theory was defended by Thomas N. Carver and Frank A. Fetter.  Frank H. Knight continued the polemics against the Austrian theory of capital through the 1930s.  Irving Fisher would pick up several essential components of it to build his own theory of capital and interest, which was much better received.  Elsewhere, Böhm-Bawerk's theory of capital was picked up, cleaned up and improved by Knut Wicksell in Sweden. The reception of Böhm-Bawerk's theory of capital by the rest of the Austrian school was lukewarm at first. Friedrich von Wieser distanced himself from it, while his mentor Carl Menger was never enthused by it, and predicted that ""the time will come when people will realize that Böhm-Bawerk's theory is one of the greatest errors ever committed."" (C. Menger, as quoted by J. Schumpeter, 1954: p.847).  It was given a blistering critique by Emil Sax in 1916.  Nonetheless, it was embraced by Böhm-Bawerk's students, Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich A. von Hayek. Hayek in particular made the theory of capital the centerpiece of his work on business cycles in the 1920s and 1930s. Böhm-Bawerk also authored a significant 1896 critique of volume III of Karl Marx's Capital, disputing his resolution of the ""transformation problem"".   [Clarification on Böhm-Bawerk's editions: the general title was Capital und Capitalzins.  The first volume had specific title Geschichte und Kritik der Capitalstheorien (""History and Critique of Interest Theories"") was first published in 1884.  English translator William Smart published it under general title Capital and Interest (1890).  Second volume had specific title  Positive Theorie des Capitals (""Positive Theory of Capital"") and was published in 1889, and Smart translated it under specific title Positive Theory of Capital in 1891.  A substantially revised second German edition of the first volume was published in 1900, containing an appendix reviewing the literature published since 1884.  This edition was not translated, but an English translation of its appendices was published in 1903 as Recent Literature on Interest. A revised second German edition of the second volume was published in 1902, this was not translated.  Böhm-Bawerk then began a third edition of the second volume, which appeared in two parts - the first in 1909, the second in 1912.  Each of these parts contained additional new appendices known as the Exkurse (""Essays"").  In 1914,  Böhm-Bawerk published a revised third edition of the first volume.  Everything was reorganized in 1921, for a new posthumous German edition, edited by Friedrich von Wieser.  It was now organized into three volumes under the general title of Capital und Capitalzins and referred to as the fourth edition.  The first volume was just the 1914 third edition of the Geschichte und Kritik unchanged.  The second volume was 1909 & 1912 parts of the third edition of the Positive Theorie bound together in one volume.  The third volume collected the additional essays of the 1909 and 1912 parts separately into one volume, with particular title Exkurse zur Positive Theorie des Capitals.  It was only in 1959 that a new English translation of the 1921 German three-volume edition was undertaken by George D. Huncke and Hans F. Sennholz, with general title Capital and Interest and specific titles ""History and Critique of Interest Theories"" (v.1, orig. 1884), ""Positive Theory of Capital"" (v.2, orig. 1889) and ""Further Essays on Capital and Interest"" (v.3, orig. 1909 & 1912).]         Major works of Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk   Resources on Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk Contemporary Modern All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

"Pierre le Pesant, Seigneur de Boisguilbert", 1646-1714.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/boisguilbert.htm,"  Pierre le Pesant, Sieur de Boisguilbert (or Boisguillebert) was an early Enlightenment economist, the first of the great continental liberals. Boisguilbert was a radical opponent of Colbertisme, and an avid proponent of laissez-faire and minimalist government.  He has been  regarded as the father of the Physiocrats and grandfather of the French Liberal School.  Boisguilbert was born in Rouen, Normandy, to a small noble family and was educated by Jesuits.  Although the eldest son, he was disinherited in favor of his younger brother, leaving him with meager means.  This situation was rectified in 1677 when Boisguilbert married a wealthy heiress.  He went to pursue a career as  magistrate, becoming a judge in Montivillier (near Le Havre) in 1678.  In 1690, he purchased the office of superintendant of the baillage of Rouen, and in 1699 the Lieutenant-General of the police of the city.  He was temporarily discharged and exiled to Brives, as his treatises displeased the controller-general of France.  He resumed his offices in 1707, and passed it on to his children at his death in 1714. His professional duties brought him in contact with the poor in Normandy, an impoverished area of France.  Boisguilbert was naturally curious about what made certain regions wealthier and others poorer. His first work Detail de la France, first appeared anonymously in 1695, and went through several subsequent editions.  He examined the economic poverty of France and the dire straits of monarchical finances. He concluded that the France of Louis XIV was, basically, a mismanaged country. Its people, he argued, were miserable and only subdued by violence which, Boisguilbert predicted, was a state of affairs that could not last for very long.  The government, he argued, should withdraw as much as possible from the workings of the economy. In general, Colbertiste policies, however well-intentioned, were misguided.  Furthermore, when they unbalanced this natural order, they were pernicious.  He believed the situation could be recovered by lifting artificial restrictions on exchange, labor and production.  Among his more specific policy recommendations was an overhaul and equalization of the land-and-property tax (taille), the suppression of internal customs and tariffs (aides), the liberalization of the grain commerce inside France, the substitution of foreign export duties with import duties and abstention from Affaires extraordinaires.   The Detail did not garner much reaction.  It is said that Boisguilbert (who had been in correspondence with the French ministries since 1691) at one point managed to secure a hearing with the French finance minister, Louis Phélypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain,. In a prelude to his remarks, Boisguilbert warned that the minister might find him mad at first, but that he would soon realize he was right. Pontchartrain burst out laughing and replied he would stick with the first impression, and turned his back on him.  (It is possible this meeting was before the Detail). Boisguilbert tried again in his 1705/06 Factum, reiterating his thesis and policy proposals more clearly, this time also promoting the abolition of all aides and customs duties, and the institutionalization of a dixieme (10% tax on revenues) to make up for shortfalls.  This time he caught public attention, and Boisguilbert was invited to an audience with Michel Chamillart, the controller-general of France, who listened to him favorably, but considered his proposals impractical given the ongoing urgencies of the War of Spanish Succession. Sebastian de Vauban, who had a very similar ideas as Boisguilbert, put out his tract on the Dixime Royal in early 1707.  It met the immediate disfavor of the King Louis XIV, sinking any prospect of reform.  In response to the Vauban debacle and the impasse of his own ideas, Boisguilbert naively put out his hot-headed Supplement, savaging the French ministers for their cowardice.  This earned him a sharp but brief rebuke - the French government proscribed his books and exiled him for six months to Auvergne.  By the intervention of friends, Boisguilbert managed to return to Rouen and restored his offices in late 1707. In the 1707 edition of the Détail de la France, Boisguilbert appended several unpublished tracts, notably his Traité de la nature, and the Causes de la rareté de l'argent and his theoretical masterpiece, the Dissertation.  The Dissertation seeks to lay out a theoretical basis for the causes of wealth. As his measure of wealth, Boisguilbert took not cash nor the riches of the local aristocrats, but rather the ""well-being"" or ""satisfaction"" of all subjects.   This, he said, arises merely from production, giving each of the classes of society (farmers, artisans, merchants, etc.) a productive role in the creation of wealth.  In this respect, he seems closer to Adam Smith (1776) than the Physiocrats, although he does launch themes the latter would pick up: e.g. that agriculture is the most important kind of productive activity, that landlords form an important consumption base, etc.  He outlines on the importance of circulation - trade, income - notes that poverty can arise by the disruption or distortion of such flows.  He blames excessive, uneven taxation and distortionary prices as the principal causes of economic crisis.  Boisguilbert was keen to show that ""money"" was not the source of wealth, but only circulated it.  Eager to knock it off its pedestal, Boisguilbert argued that money was not characterized by its ""metal"" content (gold and silver), but rather was a mere artifice of social convention, and thus its value rises and falls accordingly.  Consequently, the Mercantilist obsession with the accumulation of money was misplaced.  He advocated the substitution of metallic money with paper-money, partly because he felt that undermine the ""tyranny"" of money. Boisguilbert was among the first to come up with analogy of the economy as an organism.  In Hobbesian fashion, he believed it was in the nature of men to always seek their own profit, even at the expense of others.  However, anticipating Montesquieu, he argued that their contrasting forces would ultimately end up in ""natural harmony"".  Nature alone, he argued, was a sufficient policeman of the social and economic order.   Boisguilbert's works were a great influence upon Quesnay, the Physiocrats and other Enlightenment economists.  Interestingly, Karl Marx claimed a great intellectual debt to Boisguilbert.

Giovanni di Fidanza (Bonaventure), 1221-1274,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bonaventure.htm," Italian Scholastic and leading Franciscan theologian.  Originally from the environs of Viterbo, Tuscany, Bonaventure joined the Franciscan order in 1238, and in 1242, went to Paris to study theology under Alexander of Hales.  He obtained his bachelorship in 1248 and his mastership under Hales's successor,  Jean de la Rochelle, around 1255.  It was during this time that Bonaventure composed his Commentaria on the four books of Peter Lombard's Sentences, in imitation (but superseding) Hales in its careful fusion of Augustine and Aristotle, decidedly more mystical and Neo-Platonic. Bonaventure insists (and clarifies) the partition between philosophy and theology - arguing that while knowledge of God may be the source of philosophy, He cannot Himself be accessed by reason, but only revelation.  This contrasts with the bubbling rationalist Aristotleanism of his great contemporary, Thomas Aquinas.   According to Bonaventure, ""philosophical science is the way to other sciences; but he who wishes to stop there, falls into darkness"".  As a result, while crediting Aristotle as a great natural philosopher, Bonaventure rejects his metaphysics. He finds Aristotle riddled with more error than Plato or Plotinus, who at least allowed room for a truth ""outside"" the world.. Bonaventure's philosophical works include his Intenerarium, Breviloquium,  De Reductione and Collationes.  His opusculums on Triplici Via, Soliloquium, are more mystical exercises.  He also wrote several commentaries on the Scriptures (notably the Gospel of St. Luke) Bonaventure's reception of his Mastership was delayed by a quarrel in the University of Paris, between  the ""Regulars"" (i.e. those attached to a religious order, e.g. Franciscans, Dominicans) and the ""Seculars"" (unattached, the dominant scholar-clerics of the university).  The recent inroads made into the university life by the Orders in recent years had prompted a reaction by the Seculars and the University authorities, and Bonaventure and other Regulars (notably the Dominican Thomas Aquinas) were barred from being recognized as professors and prevented from teaching in Paris in 1255. After a vigorous campaign and special papal intervention, Bonaventure and Aquinas were restored in 1257. By that time, however, already had a new job. Bonaventure was elected Master-General of the Franciscan Order in February 1257.  At that time, the Franciscan Order was riven by a quarrel that had grown since the death of its founder, St. Francis of Assisi, in 1226.  It pitted the ""Conventuals"" (who sought engagement in cities and social life) against the ""Spirituals"" (whom insisted on an extreme interpretation of  Franciscan ideal of absolute poverty in rural mendicancy.)  Bonaventure tried to discipline the more extremist partisans of each faction - on the one hand proceeding with prosecutions of several Spiritual leaders as heretics, while imposing reforms on the Conventuals, promulgating new set of rules at General Chapter of Narbonne in 1260.  In connection with this, Bonaventure set out to compose his a life of St. Francis, the first version (Legenda Minor) soon superseded by his more carefully researched second version (Legenda) in 1261.  This was declared the official biography at the Chapter of Pisa in 1263, and was followed up by a ban on other alternative Franciscan hagiographies at the Chapter of Paris in 1266.  In 1265, Bonaventure was offered the vacant Archbishopric of York, but turned down the offer.  He however, accepted the offer of Cardinal-Bishop of Albano by Pope Gregory X in 1273 and resigned his position as Master-General of the Franciscans. Bonaventure died in 1274, shortly after attending the important Council of Lyons, where the unification of the Western and Eastern churches was (temporarily) achieved. Bonaventure was canonized as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church in 1482, and granted the honorific title of ""Seraphic Doctor"" in 1557.

Pasquale Boninsegni, 1869-1939,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/boninsegni.htm,"Bologna-born Italian economist, follower of Pareto and his successor to his chair at the University of Lausanne. Born to a modest family in Rimini, he studied mathematics at Bologna, obtaining his degree in 1894.  Active in socialist causes during his student years, Boninsegni had repeated run-ins with the Italian authorities, and was placed under house arrest for some time.  He would emerge as a leading activist of the PSI (Italian Socialist Party), and was involved in multiple organizing activities in the late 1890s, most notably mobilizing the peasantry in the Roman countryside.  In 1899, he took over as editor of L'Asino, a leftist satirical magazine, for which he was sentenced again in 1900 for defamation.  However, Boninsegni had already fled the country before the sentence could be carried out.  Boninsegni  left Italy for Switzerland in 1900.  Boninsegni made his way to Lausanne, where he met Vilfredo Pareto, who persuaded him to set aside his political activities and take up mathematical economics. Boninsengi became a close follower of Pareto's economics, and was an early propagator of the Paretian approach.  He promptly entered into polemics with Uggo Gobbi in a series in the 1901 Giornale degli Economisti.   Boninsegni's 1902 article (a review of Aupetit) may be the first to give a clear description of the Paretian choice theory, as an alternative to cardinal utility (divesting marginalism from its utilitarian overtones).  His 1932 essay develops a compact model of general economic equilibrium based only upon the idea of transformation among goods. Boninsegni succeeded Pareto as professor at the University of Lausanne in 1906, where he taught economics, as well as all the other social sciences, until his death in 1939.  In 1928, he was promoted to ""ordinary professor"", and in 1929 became director of the school of social science at Lausanne. In the 1920s, Boninsegni abandoned his socialist roots and embraced the fascist movement in Italy. He persuaded the University of Lausanne to grant an honorary degree for Benito Mussolni in 1937.  Boninsegni was made Senator of Italy in 1939..      Major Works of Pasquale Boninsegni   Resources on de Passquale Boninsengi   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Charles Booth, 1840-1916.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/booth.htm,"English industrialist and social scientist, most famous for leading a compilation of statistics on the London poor. Originally from a Unitarian family in Liverpool.  A successful but bored glove manufacturer, Charles Booth had been provoked in 1885 by the claims of H.H. Hyndman (leader of Social Democratic Federation) that 25% of Londoners lived in poverty. An enthusiast of August Comte in his youth, Charles Booth set his business aside and decided to investigate the question systematically.  In 1886, Booth recruited a bunch of researchers (including his cousin Beatrice Potter and H. Llewellyn Smith) to investigate the situation in the East End of London, street by street, and compile statistics (some quantitative, some anecdotal) on the condition of its inhabitants.  The findings of the Booth researchers were published in the magisterial Labour and Life of the People, the first volume of which came out in 1889.   Booth reported that they discovered the poverty rate was 35%, much higher than expected. Booth continued his statistical investigation, expanding to cover the rest of London and eventually produced 17 volumes between 1891 to 1903 (with title now flipped to Life and Labour of the People of London).  The second series (published 1895-97), covered the conditions and occupations of all London residents, and the third series (1902) mapped out the distribution of religious institutions and poor relief. From his investigations, Charles Booth put out a series of pamphlets asserting the State should take more responsibility for the welfare of the poor - what he called ""limited socialism"" - including the provision of old age pensions. Booth's 1901 paper on locomotion noticed and celebrated the impact of the underground tube and tramway lines as a way of reducing the overcrowded conditions of the London slums, by allowing the urban poor to migrate away from the city center towards the healthier edges of the city, and encouraging the development of new cheap housing estates in formerly agricultural land. Booth's 1904 paper embracing the cause of tariff reform and protectionism invoked a sharp rebuke from the young Cambridge philosopher Bertrand Russell. Charles Booth sat on the Poor Law Commission established in December, 1905, but resigned in January 1908 on account of ill-health, about a year before it put out its famous competing reports in 1909.  Booth authored his opinion of the reports in a 1910 pamphlet.        Major Works of Charles Booth     Resources on  Charles Booth   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1868-1931.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bortkiewicz.htm," Russian statistician and economist, who worked in Germany for much of his career. Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz was born and raised in St. Petersburg, Russia, from a family of Russian nobles of Polish descent.  His father, a military man, taught at the local artillery school. Bortkiewicz and studied at the university of St. Petersburg until 1890, subsequently producing a thesis in  mathematical statistics for the academy of national economy.. Borkiewicz proceeded to continue his studies abroad, spending 1891 in Strasbourg and 1892 in Göttingen (producing his dissertation on the statistics of life-expectancy), before going on to Vienna and Leipzig.   He was appointed as a lecturer (privatdozent) at the University of Strasbourg in 1895 until 1897, when he returned to St. Petersburg to take up a job with a railway company.  But Bortkiewicz didn't last long outside academia.  In 1901, he returned to Germany, and became professor of statistics and political economy at the University of Berlin (full professor after 1920) until his death in 1931. While still a student, Borktiewicz reviewed Leon Walras's work, and became an eminent advocate of mathematical economics.  However, his theoretical proclivities were more in the ""Classical"" Ricardian vein  Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz's main claim to fame is for his work on Karl Marx -  whom he simply saw as one descendant of Ricardo, setting aside his revolutionary reputation.  Bortkiewicz's solution to the Marx's ""Transformation Problem"" (1907) is considered legendary, although it was ignored at the time. Bortkiewicz was also involved in other theoretical controversies - particularly against Böhm-Bawerk and the Austrian theory of interest and also against Alfred Weber's theory of industrial location.   Bortkiewicz also produced several notable works on mathematical statistics (e.g. 1898, 1917), and is sometimes credited as a co-discoverer (certainly a popularizer) of the Poisson distribution. Although he taught in Berlin most of his life, Bortkiewicz was nonetheless opposed to the German Historical School and was more sympathetic to the mathematical efforts of the Lausanne School.  Wassily Leontief was among his students.        Major works of Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz   Resources on Ladislaus Bortkiewicz   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Giovanni Botero, 1543-1617,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/botero.htm,"  Trained in a Jesuit seminary in Palermo, Botero left the order in 1580 and came into the service of Cardinal Carlo Borromeo of Milan.  After the cardinal's death in 1584, Botero became the personal secretary of Cardinal Frederico Borromeo in Rome.   It was during his sojourn in Rome that Botero published his principal tracts.  In his 1588 Greatness of Cities and his 1591-6 Relazioni universali, Botero promulgates the famous population doctrine later taken up by Robert Malthus: namely, that the means of subsistence (vitus nutritiva) interacting with the natural human fertility (vitus generativa) will determine the actual growth rate of population.   Botero's Reason of State (1589) expounded a ""constitutionalist"" view of government, against Machiavelli's scheme of personal power for power's sake.  In this, Botero was closer to Jean Bodin.  The power of the prince, Botero argues, relies ultimately on the power granted to him by the people and people's allegiance to a State is potentially far stronger than to an individual prince.  Consequently, in the interest of his own preservation, the prince should do as much as possible to encourage ""allegiance to the State"" in the minds of the people.  This means things like enshrining consultation, representation, religion, etc. in the legal and political institutions of the state, so as to create what we might call today a ""stakeholder"" society.  Simultaneously, this means keeping personal interventions and ""great works"" to a minimum.   Consequently, Christian ethics and other codes of social behavior should not be dismissed as irrelevant encumbrances on the personal rule of the prince, but rather, by being enshrined in the institutions of the State, they can be the most potent source of power for the prince.  In short, limiting personal power and exhibiting ethical behavior ultimately pays off by making the interests of the people coincident with the preservation of the State -- and thus the preservation of the sovereign.    In 1599, Botero was appointed a political consultant and tutor in the court of the Duke of Savoy.  Outside of a brief campaign in Spain, Botero would remain in Turin for the remainder of his life.      Major Works of Giovanni Botero   Resources on Giovanni Botero   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Kenneth E. Boulding, 1910-1993.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/boulding.htm," Kenneth Ewart Boulding never knew any boundaries.  Born was born in humble circumstances to a working-class family in Liverpool, England. He overcame class prejudice to win a scholarship to a prestigious local high school and an undergraduate scholarship in chemistry at New College, Oxford in 1928.  Under the advice of Lionel Robbins, Boulding switched from chemistry to economics and published his first paper (1932) while still an undergraduate.   Although raised a strong Methodist,  Boulding converted and joined the Society of Friends (Quakers) during his first year of Oxford.  Boulding's devout Quaker faith and dedicated pacifism would be an important guiding influence for the remainder of his life.  Kenneth E. Boulding sailed to the United States of America as a Commonwealth fellow in 1932, to spend two years at the University of Chicago.  At Chicago, Boulding came under the influence of both Frank Knight and Henry Schultz and wrote a series of papers on capital theory (entering the capital debate contra Austrians). A chance meeting with Joseph Schumpeter on the transatlantic crossing induced him to also spend a semester at Harvard during his stay.  Deciding not to pick up a Ph.D. at Chicago, Boulding returned to Britain in 1934.  He went up to Scotland as an assistant lecturer at the University of Edinburgh.  Although Edinburgh was not as intellectually vibrant as Chicago or Harvard, Boulding was introduced to accounting during his period, which he would later deploy in his thinking.   In 1937, Boulding crossed back over to America to attend a Quaker conference in Philadelphia, and almost by chance landed a job at Colgate University.  During his time at Colgate, Boulding wrote his monumental two-volume textbook, Economic Analysis - the epitome of the Neoclassical- Keynesian Synthesis.  Around the same time he met and married Else Bjorn-Hansen, a sociologist who would be highly influential on his work.  After four years at Colgate, Boulding proceeded peripatetically around the country.  He worked at the League of Nations at Princeton (he was forced to resign after publishing a tract on pacifism in 1942), then at Fisk University in Tennessee.  In 1943, he moved to Iowa State College at Ames (at T.W. Schultz's invitation, as a labor economist). The geographically-unbounded Boulding was also intellectually unbounded - perhaps a legacy of his early mentor and greatest influence, Frank Knight. His early work on opportunity cost, capital theory and his 1941 textbook were exercises in mostly conventional economics - which earned him the prestigious John Bates Clark Medal of the AEA in 1949 (and the Presidency in 1968). It was at Iowa State that Boulding wrote his 1944 paper on liquidity preference and his famous 1950 Reconstruction of Economics. These were attempts at reconstructing economics around a balance-sheet approach (rather than income statement), thus analyzing the economy with emphasis on stocks rather than flows. Boulding traces the inspiration for this approach to Adam Smith and reaches conclusion similar to Keynes's Treatise, and can be said to be a contribution in the Post Keynesian vein. Boulding would later characterize his macroeconomic theory of distribution built out in his Reconstruction as his most important contribution, and regretted it not receiving sufficient attention. Boulding moved to University of Michigan in 1949.  By this time, Boulding realized the importance of using other disciplines, like sociology, anthropology, political science, and even philosophy and theology to tackle real world economic problems.  The economy should not be analyzed in isolation, but conceived as part of a general social system.  Boulding began to engage in cross-disciplinary work, and opening discussions toward a general integration of the social sciences.  As he would later remember, the social scientists ""did not want to be integrated very much"", but he found much interest among biologists, physicists and engineers. Drawing on his experience with church activities, Boulding wrote his Organizational Revolution (1953) examining the operation and impact of large-scale organizations (like unions, churches. etc.) for social improvement. Advancements in communications technology since the late 19th Century had enabled the emergence of large organizations, to organize towards a goal.  But many had become too large for their own good, and more liable to become crippled by internal defects, politics, misdirection and inadvertent outsized impacts.  Boulding argues that the diffusion among many organizations works better to achieving social improvements, then amalgamating into a single large organization. Boulding spent a year (1954-55) at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, which he credits as one of his most creative.  During that year, Boulding was one of the founders, with mathematician Anatol Rappoport and biologists Ludwig von Bertalanffy and Ralph Gerard, of the Society of General Systems Research (now the International Society for the System Sciences, ISSS), which was dedicated to taking a integrated cross-disciplinary approach to the analysis of general systems.  It was towards the end of his Stanford year that Boulding wrote The Image (1956), one of his more broadly influential works.  He recited it on a dictaphone in nine days.  Discarding behaviorism, Boulding emphasizes how individual human behavior is guided by subjective constructed worldviews (""image"") rather than immediate stimuli.  Worldviews are constructed by consciousness and knowledge of one's history, society, influences, etc. New information gets processed by a worldview, and may also sometimes transform it.  Boulding outlines a co-evolutionary vision of individual and society.  He proposes a new science of ""eiconomics"" (study of images, i.e. human knowledge) and how it can be built from other sciences.  Boulding would later call it an attempt to bring humanities into the social sciences. On his return to Michigan, Boulding established the Center for Research in Conflict Resolution and the Journal of Conflict Resolution as an application of the integrated social science approach towards the goal of peace. Another year abroad at the University of the West Indies (1959-60) led to another influential work Conflict and Defense (1962) to provide the analytical foundations of peace studies.  He breaks up social systems into exchange systems (this for that, motivation by self-interest, prevalent in the economy),  threat systems (if..then, motivation by fear, as in the judicial system), and integrative systems (one-sided grants, motivated by love, as in a family).  All three systems are essential for society, but while the scope of some (e.g. exchange) have expanded, integrative systems have diminished, or never had a proper chance to develop beyond a small nuclear unit. Yet another year abroad the International Christian University in Japan (1963-64) led to his first work on evolutionary economics proper (1970), drawing from biology to propose a new analysis of human history, through mutation and selection, as a ""non-dialectical"" counterpoint to the Marxism then popular among his Japanese students.  Out of his reflections on evolutionary selection in an ecological environment, Boulding authored a small article in 1966 on ""Spaceship Earth"", which many have since credited as the beginning of ecological economics.  In line with his life-long pacifism, Boulding led the first ""teach-in"" against the Vietnam War in March 1965 at University of Michigan.  In 1967, K.E. Boulding moved to the University of Colorado at Boulder. As he would later put it, Kenneth E. Boulding lived ""on the uneasy margin between science and religion"", and was a forceful advocate of bringing ethical, religious and ecological concerns to bear on the analysis of desirable economic outcomes. He was also a ceaseless activist for the trans-disciplinary work and the general integration of the social sciences. Boulding was also something of a poet (see his sonnets, 1945), ethical and social philosopher (e.g. 1968) and, as his practical efforts demonstrate, a scholar of social conflict, war and peace (e.g. 1962, 1968, 1978, 1985).

Francis Bowen, 1811-1890.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bowen.htm," American clergyman, historian and philosopher and the first teacher of economics at Harvard. Francis Bowen, affectionately known as ""Fanny"" Bowen to his students, was an editor of the North American Review and controversial historian and philosopher at Harvard.  Francis Bowen was a native of Charlestown, Massachusetts, and graduated from Harvard in 1833, while teaching part-time at the Exeter academy.  In 1835,  Bowen became an instructor in intellectual philosophy, but resigned in 1839 to undertake a European tour.  Bowen stayed for a while in Paris, where he met and befriended Sismondi, and absorbed his critiques of Classical economics.  Bowen was critical of the work of Mill, found the Malthusian population doctrines ""absurd and pernicious"" and the free trade doctrines of the Manchester School rather dubious.  Bowen's early interests were primarily in philosophy.  Bowen had taken aboard a distaste for New England transcendentalism and Kantian philosophy (Bown has been called an forerunner of American pragmatism - Charles S. Peirce and William James were Bowen's students).  Despite his affinity with Lockean empiricism and Scottish common sense philosophy (Bowen put out an edition of Dugald Stewart's works and was a stout defender of Sir William Hamilton), Bowen also nurtured some peculiar anti-British prejudices (e.g.).    Bowen returned from Europe in late 1841, and the very next year bought a controlling interest in the North American Review.  Bowen would be a frequent contributor and editor of the North American Review in the 1840s and 1850s.  Bowen reconnected with Harvard and delivered the Lowell lectures in 1848-49.  In 1850, Francis Bowen was selected as McLean professor of history at Harvard (succeeding Jared Sparks, who had ascended to the presidency).  Despite not being yet confirmed by the Harvard board, Bowen began teaching in the Fall semester of 1850. However, a series of politically-outspoken articles in the NAR - notably a defense of the 1850 Compromise and two controversial articles highly critical of the Hungarian uprising - cost him his job.  Although recommended by the Harvard faculty, in February 1851,  the Board of Overseers, wary of Bowen's political positions, refused to confirm Bowen and gave the McLean chair to someone else. This sparked a brief row over academic freedom at Harvard.  But a significant cause for Bowen's dismissal was doubts about his scholarship; Bowen was accused of outright plagiarism - the bulk of Bowen's Hungarian articles had been essentially copied, almost word for word, from a pair of French articles in the conservative Revue des Deux Mondes (a charge brought to light by Boston journalist Robert Carter in a series of articles in the Boston Atlas in 1850). Nonetheless, with the ascension of James Walker as the new president of Harvard in 1853, Bowen fortunes were restored and Francis Bowen was appointed Alford Professor of Natural Religion, Moral Philosophy and Civil Polity.  Responding to the notion that some familiarity with political economy was part of the education of every ""gentleman"", Bowen began to teach the first courses on political economy at Harvard College.   Unwilling to use a British book, Francis Bowen composed his own 1859 textbook on political economy.  It was a conscious ""adaptation"" of Classical economics to the ""American situation"" (esp. lack of population pressure).  As befit the religious conditions of the Alford Professorship, Bowen dutifully infused the text relating the economic system to Divine Providence (however, in his religious ideas, Bowen was an outspoken Unitarian). Although politically conservative in most respects, Bowen's predilection for a loose ""greenback"" policy brought him into conflict with the conservative trustees.  To shield Harvard students from Bowen's ""dangerous"" ideas, the grandees of Massachusetts funded a separate chair of political economy.  In 1872, they appointed a new ""hard money"" economist (Charles Dunbar) to that chair.  Dunbar subsequently took over Bowen's responsibilities in economics. On a side-note, Bowen was one of the first American reviewers of Charles Darwin's Origin of the Species, but found his theory of evolution altogether improbable and absurd.  Bowen criticized Darwin not only because his conclusions went against common sense natural philosophy, but also because its speculative basis and insufficient reliance on empirical evidence seemed unscientific (1860, 1861).

Sir Arthur L. Bowley, 1869-1957.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bowley.htm," English economist and statistician.  Arthur Lyon Bowley was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, during the tenure of Alfred Marshall, Bowley went on to become a lecturer at the newly-founded London School of Economics in 1895.  He would remain at L.S.E  for much of the remainder of his career. Sir Arthur Bowley is best known for his active role in furthering the use of quantitative methods in economics. His famous Mathematical Groundwork (1924) resurrected the work of Francis Edgeworth, analyzed his theory of bargaining and popularized the famous ""Edgeworth-Bowley"" box.  His prominent position at the London School of Economics  made him an important ally of Lionel Robbins in his attempts to recast that institution away from its Fabian roots. Bowley's penchant for quantitative methods are rooted in his early training as a mathematician and statistician - his 1893 and 1900 studies being largely viewed by him as exercises in applied statistics rather than economic history. His 1900 study, in particular, was later used by A.W. Phillips to develop his (in)famous ""Phillips Curve"". Bowley's work included a brave attempt in 1927 to estimate the British national income which, although not very successful, nonetheless launched further attempts by others to compile national income accounts. The so-called ""Bowley's Law"", i.e. constancy of wage share in national income, was presumably derived in that book. With R.G.D. Allen, Bowley also conducted one of the first empirical studies of consumption behavior (1935). All this concentration on quantitative work should be unsurprising as Bowley's main career appointments were as a statistician and his most successful book was in fact his Elements of Statistics (1901) - incidentally, the first such textbook in the English language.

Although he never studied at Bologna, Henry of Bracton was greatly influenced by the meticulous Azo of Bologna, and drew large parts from the latter's Summa of Roman law.

Ludwig Joseph (Lujo) Brentano, 1844-1931.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/brentano.htm,"  One of the leaders of the German Historical School. Born in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria, Lujo Brentano studied at a variety of universities - Dublin, Heidelberg, Munich, Würzburg and Göttingen.  After finishing his Ph.D. at Gottingen in 1867, with a thesis on von Thunen, Brentano set off for a sojourn in England, where he studied the British working classes, and become an expert on the English guilds and trade unions.  After returning to Germany, Brentano submitted his habilitation at Berlin in 1871 and remained as privatdozent at Berlin. The very next year, Lujo Brentano was appointed associate professor at the University of Breslau, raised to ordinary (full) professor in 1873.  A decade later, in 1882, Brentano succeeded Schmoller at Strasbourg, where he remained until 1888. After a brief stint at Vienna (1888-89) and Leipzig (1889-91), Brentano settled down as professor at the University of Munich in 1891, where he remained until the end of his career. Lujo Brentano was perhaps the most liberal and theory-friendly of the German Historical School.  His own research was on European guilds and trade unions.  He not only produced an overwhelming amount of exceptional historical work, but also extended it to policy conclusions, arguing that trade unions and other labor organizations could do very well by themselves without State assistance.  He explored how the essential glue of the economic units -- fraternity -- however, was came apart over time with the development of capitalism. He vigorously disputed Weber's thesis on the link between Calvinism and capitalism.  He also authored (anonymously) some dismissive articles about Karl Marx in 1872 which yielded some polemics.  Brentano was a founder of the Verein für Socialpolitik in 1872-73, with Gustav Schmoller and Adolph Wagner.  Brentano was also (together with Franz von Holtzendorff) the founding editor of the Jahrbuch für Gesetzgebung, Verwaltung und Volkswirtschaft im Deutschen Reich (JfGVV, later, from 1881, taken over by Schmoller and better known as ""Schmollers Jarhbuch"") Lujo Brentano was one of the leaders of the world pacifist movement and brother of the philosopher Franz Brentano.

John Bright, 1811-1889.   ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bright.htm," British Quaker manufacturer, Liberal politician and leading member, with Richard Cobden, of the Anti-Corn Law League and ""Manchester School"" liberalism.  John Bright was elected a member of parliament in 1843 for Durham, and from 1847 for Manchester.  A vigorous peace activist, Bright opposed the Crimean War, Bright lost his Manchester seat in 1857 but got elected for Birmingham later that same year, a seat he would retain for the next thirty years.  In parliament, John Bright was a vigorous promoter of free trade, financial reform, the expansion of the suffrage, national education, opposed the EIC government in India and supported the northern states during the United States Civil War.  In 1868, he joined the Liberal government of William Gladstone, as President of the Board of Trade. Severe health problems forced him to resign in 1870.  But after recovery, he returned to government, joining Gladstone's government in 1873 as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, but lost his position when the Gladstone government fell in 1874.  He returned to the same position in the 1880 Gladstone cabinet, but resigned 1882 over the bombardment of Alexandria.  Despite his earlier sympathies with the Irish cause and his leadership in the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland and other Irish reform bills, Bright opposed Home Rule and split from the Liberals over the issue in 1886, joining instead the Union Liberals (despite their protectionist inclinations) for his last few years.

Henry Brougham, 1778-1868,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/brougham.htm," Scottish lawyer, essayist, liberal reformer, education pioneer and Whig statesman.  (""Brougham"" is generally today pronounced as the monosyllabic ""broom"", although if Lord Byron has it right, its northern, Scottish root should be the two-syllable ""brew-am"", itself a softening of the older ""brooch-ham"" or ""bruff-ham"", in turn a corruption of the ancient Saxon estate of Burgham in Westmoreland). Henry Brougham was born in Edinburgh, to a family of ancient but otherwise unremarkable English gentry in Cumberland. His father, Henry Brougham Sr, whom Henry Jr. later derided as a ""weak man"", had no profession, but simply taken residence in Edinburgh.  After being educated in the High School of the city, Henry Brougham enrolled at the University of Edinburgh.  Brougham demonstrated an early penchant for science - a paper on optics was published in the Transactions of the Royal Society still within his first year, at the tender age of 17.  After a couple of more papers, Brougham was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in March 1803.  But Brougham lay his scientific interests aside, and embarked on a legal career in 1800, being called to the Scotch bar 1802.    To support himself during his legal studies, Brougham set about writing.  His first treatise, on colonial economic policy (1803) started him off.  He hoped to set himself up as an expert on colonial trade issues. It exhibited the imprint of the Scottish school, but not all the way.  Despite his well-directed attack on the slave trade and mercantilism, Brougham defended the retention of the colonies (in opposition to Smith and Tucker), seeing them consistent with the principles of free trade and useful for excess population and the maintenance of industrial profits. Brougham's real breakthrough was in founding, together with Edinburgh friends Sydney Smith, Francis Horner and Francis Jeffrey, The Edinburgh Review, in 1802.  Brougham contributed numerous articles to the Review and helped set it on its path as the prominent Whig quarterly (in contrast to its Tory rival Quarterly Review).  In the early years, Brougham wrote most of the economics articles of the Edinburgh Review, particularly those relating to colonial policy, until John Ramsay McCulloch joined the Review in 1818.  Beyond economics, Brougham was indefatigable contributor on science and literature.  Brougham authored the famously humiliating critique of the young Lord Byron's poetry in the 1808 Review, to which Byron replied with his biting English Bards and Scotch Reviewers.  Brougham's later vicious critique of another romantic poet, John Keats, is said to have killed him. Brougham carried on his legal career through the early years of the Review.  But finding Scotland confining, Henry Brougham eventually moved to London, where he enrolled at Lincoln's Inn in 1807 and was called to the English bar. One of Brougham's early English cases was the celebrated petition of British merchants in the House of Commons in early 1808 against the Orders in Council, blockading trade with French ports. Brougham's legal reputation and the success of the Edinburgh Review gave Brougham entry into the political world. He gravitated quickly into the circle of Foxite Whigs, now led by Charles Grey (Earl Grey) and Henry Petty FitzMaurice (Marquess of Lansdowne). With their help, Henry Brougham was elected a Whig member of parliament in 1810 via a rotten borough.  Brougham participated in the Bullionist debate in 1811.  He ran for a competitive seat in Liverpool in 1812, but lost.  But be returned to parliament again in 1816, and would hold a series of seats, continuously remaining in parliament until 1830.  Brougham made a reputation for himself as a Whig leader in the House of Commons, a powerful orator and ardent promoter of laissez-faire, anti-slavery, tort and educational reform  But to the general English public, Brougham was perhaps best known as the defender of Queen Caroline against charges of adultery in 1820.  Brougham was a comrade and popularizer of the London classical economists, notably J.R. McCulloch,  James Mill  and Harriet Martineau.  Brougham was a founder of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (SDUK) in 1825 and University College London in 1828.  In 1830, Brougham was brought into Earl Grey's Whig cabinet as Lord Chancellor (effectively, minister of justice), and raised to a peerage in the process as the first ""Baron Brougham and Vaux"".  Brougham moved his ground of operations from Commons to Lords.  He was a a leading figure behind the Parliamentary Reform bill of 1832, the abolition of slavery act of 1833 and the expansion of the jurisdiction of Old Bailey.  He remained Chancellor under Viscount Melbourne's government in 1834, but was vacated at the end of that year when Peel's Tories took office. Brougham spent his post-ministerial years in the House of Lords, authoring treatises on natural theology and sketches of the men he had known, including David Ricardo (""not overtopping all others in learning, nor entitled to be reckoned a man of genius"", in Brougham's estimation).

Originally from Montrose, Scotland, the son of a printer and classical scholar, and older brother of the engineer George Buchanan.  David Buchanan was an early enthusiast of Adam Smith and Classical economics (although critical of certain Ricardian additions, e.g. on rent). Buchanan helped propagate its doctrines.  Buchanan was the editor of a celebrated 1814 edition of Smith's Wealth of Nations, to which he appended a volume of his own notes on the treatise.  His later 1844 treatise was a solid defense of laissez faire and free trade policy.  Buchanan was also an early proponent of progressive taxation, having been among the first to challenge the Smith's old proposition that taxes on wages would be fully passed on in the form of higher wages.  Buchanan pointed out that taxes would lead to real cutbacks in worker consumption and standards of living. (e.g. 1817: p.211)  His 1844 treatise argued vigorously against the introduction of income taxes primarily for this reason, as well as complaining that 'inquisitions' into incomes were an intrusion on personal liberty.

Karl Bücher, 1847-1930. ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bucher.htm," German Historicist from Lepzig.  Born in Kirberg, Duchy of Nassau, the son of a Lutheran farmer. Karl Bücher studied ancient history and philology at the University of Bonn, before starting on a career as a teacher. He dabbled in journalism, serving for a while as editor of the Frankfurter Zeitung in the late 1870s.

In the 1880s, Bücher shifted to an academic career. After submitting his habilitation thesis at the University of Munich in 1881, Bücher went on to teach at Dorpat (Russian Baltics) then Basel (Switzerland, from 1882 to 1890), where came under the influence of historicist economist Albert Schäffle, before moving on to Karlsruhe polytechnic hochschule.  In 1892, Karl Bücher was appointed as professorial chair in Nationalökonomie at the University of Leipzig, where he would remain until his retirement in 1917. Bücher succeeded Albert Schäffle as editor of the Zeitschrift für gesamte Staatswissenschaft in 1901. Karl Bücher is best known for his 1893 treatise on industrial evolution.  There he outlined his famous theory of household-town-nation ""stages"" of industrial evolution.  His propensity of making these seem like ""progress"" elicited a sharp rebuke from Sombart.

Nikolai I. Bukharin, 1888-1938.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bukharin.htm," Russian Marxian economist, regarded as the foremost theoretician of the Russian Bolsheviks in their early years. Intellectually, Bukharin is usually connected with the Austro-Marxians.  Bukharin's 1917 book contained an attack on the Neoclassical Austrian School, his 1918 piece in imperialism was written before Lenin's famous tome.  Bukharin was a promoter of the ""sociological"" approach to Marxian theory championed by the Austro-Marxians, and his defense of revisionism led to his 1924 critique of Rosa Luxemburg.   Politically, he was the main promoter of the ""New Economic Plan"" in Russia, which emphasized small-scale peasant farming and the use of market incentives.

Jean Buridan, c.1295 - 1358,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/buridan.htm," French secular Scholastic philosopher and member of William of Ockham's ""Nomalist"" School (whom he later condemned).  Buridan  rose to become rector of the University of Paris and the lover of the French queen. Nicholas Oresme was his most famous pupil.  In economics, Buridan was a renowned critic of Aristotle's ""just exchange"" and an originator of the metallic theory of money.  Jean Buridan's theory of determinism and the relationship between will and intellect was ridiculed by his opponents with the parable of ""Buridan's Ass"": the dilemma of the donkey who, standing between two equal piles of hay, is so overcome with indifference that he ends up dying of starvation (a parable which can also be inveighed against modern revealed preference theory).  Buridan also developed several physical notions the presage modern Newtonian dynamics. In his critique of Aristotle, Buridan argued that an object moves not because of the air surrounding it (as Aristotle proposed), but rather because it is set in motion by the force or ""impetus"" of another body.  Air, Buridan speculated correctly, formed the resistance which slowed and eventually stopped the object.   His critique of Aristotle's astronomy (De caelo) was to be highly influential on Copernicus. In 1340, while rector in Paris, Buridan condemned his old master Ockham's school.       Major Works of Jean Buridan Resources on Jean Buridan All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Edmund Burke, 1729-1797,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/burke.htm," Irish Enlightenment social and political philosopher and British statesman.  Although reared in the Enlightenment era, Burke was a severe critic of rationalist theories of ""natural law"" and social contract.  Like David Hume, Burke believed that political and social organization evolved organically over history from a variety of political, cultural and social circumstances.  In Burke's view, current society is a robust organism that emerged piecemeal and slowly over history.  For this reason, Burke never trusted abstract ""grand plans"" for radical political, economic and/or social reorganization of society.  This has led him to be celebrated as the father of Conservatism.  However, Burke wasn't exactly an apologist of the current order either.  Tyrannical kings and parliaments, no less than tyrannical mobs, were an anathema to Burke.  It is for this reason that he defended the American Revolution (since, in his view, they were merely ""reclaiming"" their traditional rights as freeborn Englishmen) and condemned the French Revolution (which, in his view, was based on a rationalist experiment). Burke was trained as a lawyer at Trinity College, Dublin and thereafter moved to London.  In 1759, he became a private secretary to William Hamilton and then, in 1765, to Charles Wentworth, Marquis of Rockingham, the Whig prime minister.  Burke was himself elected to the House of Commons in 1765.  After the fall of the Whigs in 1766, Burke sat in opposition to the Tories in parliament. Burke took up several political causes, both in Parliament and in the press.  The first was the Wilkes crisis and the relationship between Crown and Parliament (1769, 1770) and then against the British colonial policy in America (1774, 1775).  He also raised his voice for the emancipation of Catholics, the removal of trade barriers with Ireland, the abolition of the slave trade and slavery and against the privileges and excesses of the rule of the East India Company in India (and later instigating the impeachment of Warren Hastings, governor general of India).  Some of his political positions (e.g. on Catholics) were not very popular and he would lose his parliamentary seat repeatedly as a result (always he would return with another seat). In 1771 Burke was chosen by the New York assembly as their agent in London.  Burke retired from Parliament in 1794. Burke's impact on economics was interesting.  In the modern era, his ideas about the unplanned, historical evolution of political and social norms is echoed most clearly in the later works of Friedrich Hayek and the Austrian School.  But his greatest influence was on social commentators like Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin, who invoked Burke's arguments to condemn the destructive rise of capitalist industrialism.  The Carlyle-Ruskin assault on the  ""whiggery"" of economists was already presaged in Burke's famous passage from his 1791 Reflections upon the execution of Marie Antoinette:  But the age of chivalry is gone; that of sophisters, economists, and calculators has succeeded, and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever.  (1790: p.113) Edmund Burke is famously celebrated in William Butler Yeats's poem ""The Seven Sages"".      Major Works of Edmund Burke   Resources on Edmund Burke   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Arthur Frank Burns, 1904-1987,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/burns.htm," American Institutionalist economist and chair of the Federal Reserve in the 1970s.(not to be confused with his contemporary, Arthur R. Burns) Arthur F. Burns was born in Stanislau, Austria and emigrated to the United States with his family in 1914.  Burns studied economics at the Institutionalist citadel of Columbia, obtaining his B.A. in 1925 and became a lecturer at Rutgers in 1927, while continuing his graduate studies at Columbia under Wesley C. Mitchell.  A.F. Burns joined the research staff of Mitchell's NBER in 1933 and obtained in Ph.D. from Columbia in 1934.  Burns co-authored the famous NBER study, the massive Measuring Business Cycles (1946), with Mitchell, one of the most definitive empirical works of the century. In 1944, Arthur F. Burns joined the faculty at Columbia.  He took over Mitchell's role as director of research at the NBER in 1945, turning it even more decidedly towards the business cycle vein.  Burns interrupted his tenure to serve as the chair of President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors from 1953 to 1956. Burns subsequently returned to academia at Columbia, until 1965, and served as president of the NBER from 1957 to 1967. During the Eisenhower period, Burns developed a close relationship with vice-president Richard Nixon. When Nixon became president in 1969, he brought along Burns as his special counsellor. Nixon went on to appoint A.F. Burns as the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 1970 to 1978.  In economics, Arthur Burns is most associated with the business cycle vein of the American Institutionalist school.  Burns's remarkable conservative connections did not, however, prevent him from being almost a ""liberal Keynesian"" in practice. He was behind most of the demand management during the Eisenhower administration and, later during the Nixon reign, Burns was a constant advocate of incomes policies and eschewed strict rules in the conduct of monetary policy. It was Burns who effectively undertook the ""stop-go"" monetary policy of the 1970s which later led him to be succeeded by the ferociously monetarist Paul Volcker in 1978.  Perhaps remarkably, Arthur F. Burns counted future Montarist founder Milton Friedman as his student at both Rutgers and Columbia, and Friedman's Chicago School counterpart George Stigler was one of Burns's junior colleagues during his Columbia years.  Although both of them retained a deep affection for their old professor, it did not prevent them from directing sometimes vituperative criticisms of Burns's management of the Federal Reserve in the 1970s. After his retirement, A.F. Burns took a position at the American Enterprise Insitute, served as an advisor to Ronald Reagan and was appointed American ambassador to West Germany.

Etienne Cabet, 1788-1856.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/cabet.htm," Originally from Dijon (Burgundy), the son of a cooper, Étienne Cabet managed nonetheless to acquire an education to become a teacher.  He went on to study medicine before abandoning it for law.  Entering practice in Dijon, Cabet acquired a effective reputation as a lawyer, and by 1825 had moved to Paris.  He soon fell in with the republican circles around Dupont de l'Eure.   Étienne Cabet participated in the 1830 July Revolution, and was briefly appointed procurator-general in Corsica, before being forced to resign.  In July 1831, Cabet was elected for Dijon to the Chamber of Deputies. But Cabet grew disenchanted with the conservative turn of the Orleanist regime and aligned himself with the extreme left. In 1832, Cabet wrote a scorching history of the July Revolution, and in 1833, he founded the left-wing weekly newspaper, La Populaire.  Accused of sedition in 1834, Cabet was given the choice of two years in prison or five years in exile.  Cabet took the latter, and moved  to England.  It was during his stay in England that Cabet deepened his familiarity with the work of the British  utopian socialist.Robert Owen.  After his return to France in 1839, Cabet promptly published a laudatory history of the Jacobins of 1789-92.  Cabet went on to compose a utopian novel, the Voyage to Icarus describing an ideal society in the fictional land of ""Icarie"".   Cabet introduced the idea of ""communism"" (a term of his invention) as the greatest realization of democracy and the direct descendent of Christian principles.  The publication was popular, but his embrace of utopian communism broke his remaining links to radical republicans.  Cabet revived La Populaire, and continued to promote his communist ideas.  By 1847, concluding the situation is Orleanist France was beyond repair, Cabet decided to found a utopian colony in America. In late 1847, he announced he had bought some million acres near the Red River in Texas and published a detailed prospectus for colonists in his La Populaire, setting down the rules for his new society. The first contingent of Icarian communists, some 70 persons, set off from Le Havre for Texas in early February 1848.  Others would soon follow. Cabet remained in Paris in the meantime.  The February 1848 revolution had just broke out, giving Cabet hope for France yet.  In the aftermath, Étienne Cabet founded Central Fraternal Society (Société fraternelle centrale), a radical left-wing club in Paris for pacific Owenite socialists and Icarian communists like himself, as a counterpoint to the more revolutionary confrontational clubs of Blanqui and Barbes.  Nonetheless, Cabet's club participated in the ""red surge"" of May 15, and Cabet was arrested on the floor of the National Assembly. After his release, Cabet traveled to America himself, arriving in January 1849.  By this time, the original Icarian colony in Texas had dissipated as a result of the poor climate and disease, and there was controversy with the colonists over the land assignments and accusations of fraud. Cabet collected remaining Icarian colonists in New Orleans.  In March 1849, some 480 Icarians led by Cabet set out to re-establish their colony at Nauvoo (on the Missouri-Illinois border), a site recently abandoned by the Mormons.  The new colony flourished for several years. In September 1849, Cabet was prosecuted in absentia in French courts, and so  quickly returned to France to submit his case before a court of appeals.  He was acquitted, but decided to remain on in France for a couple of years, even entertaining ideas for running for the presidency of France in 1852. But Louis Napoleon's coup in late 1851 put an end to that, and Cabet returned to America in early 1852.  He would remain there for the next few years.  Cabet's increasingly authoritarian style eventually provoked a revolt among the Icarian colonists in Nauvoo.  In October 1856, the Icarian community voted to expel Cabet and a small group of his loyalists.  Cabet made his way to St. Louis (Missouri) where he died a few weeks later (November 1856) from a brain hemorrhage..

John Elliot Cairnes, 1823-1875.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/cairnes.htm," Born in County Louth, Ireland, the son of a brewer, John Elliot Cairnes was educated at Trinity College Dublin.  He acquired his B.A. in 1848 and his M.A. in 1848.  In 1856, Cairnes won an appointment to the the Whately Chair in Political Economy at Trinity College, Dublin, which he would hold until 1861.  In 1859, Cairnes received a joint appointment as professor of jurisprudence at Queen's College Galway, which he would hold until 1870.  From 1866 to 1870, Cairnes was a professor of political economy University College London.  He retired in 1872, due to ill-health. An ardent disciple and friend of John Stuart Mill, Cairnes is often regarded as ""the last of the Classical economists"".  It was upon his shoulders that fell the responsibility of defending the Classical Ricardian doctrine in its waning years of 1869-75 -- against Thornton, against Ruskin, against his own disciple Cliffe-Leslie and, finally, against Jevons and the Marginalist Revolution.    Cairnes's most famous book -- the Whately lectures of 1857 -- was an attempt to outline the future research program for Classical economics.   Decades later, in 1874, Cairnes offered the feeble, last gasp of Classical doctrine, with the wages fund doctrine embarrassingly defended and Jevons's new theory reluctantly reviewed. Cairnes's shining hour was his widely-discussed 1862 treatise Slave Power.  Cairnes analyzed the consequences of slavery for economic development, in particular how it speeded up soil erosion, discouraged the introduction of technical innovations and stifled commerce and enterprise more generally.  Written during the American Civil War, Cairnes warned British policymakers to think twice about backing the economically-unviable Confederacy.  Cairnes book was instrumental in turning the tide of popular English opinion against the rebels. Cairnes's 1865 articles on the Irish land question were even more radical.  Arguing that labor was the basis of property in land, Cairnes denounced the attempt to introduce an English-style free market for land in Ireland and to instead encourage peasant-proprietorship via State-controlled land rents.   This radical proposal was taken up by John Stuart Mill in his own book on the Irish question -- and both Cairnes and Mill were met by howls of disapproval by classical liberals in England, who denounced the violation of the ""sanctity of free contract"".   Cairnes struck back in a series of 1870 articles in a full-frontal assault on laissez-faire dogmatism, arguing that while it was a ""good rule of thumb"", but had no ""scientific basis"" and certainly should not be applied indiscriminately as if it were a religion.  Cairnes took aim particularly at the liberal heroes, Frederic Bastiat and Hebert Spencer, taking them to task for having transformed political economy into a muddled apologist theology.

John Calvin, 1509-1564,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/calvin.htm," John Calvin (Jean Cauvin) was a 16th Century French Protestant theologian, architect of Reformed Christianity (""Calvinism"") and leader of the theocratic republic of Geneva from 1541. Although Calvin is not the inventor of Reformed tradition in Christianity, his name became closely associated with it and the terms ""Reformed"" and ""Calvinism"" are often used interchangeably.   Calvin's principle theological work was the Institutes of Christian Religion (1536, definitive ed. 1559).   Calvin's doubts on usury are found in his 1545 letter to Claude de Sachins, where he notes simply that ""I do not consider that usury is wholly forbidden among us, except it be repugnant to justice and charity.""  He is more explicit in his Commentaries on Jeremiah (pub. 1575).  Calvin finds no condemnation of usury per se in the Bible, just excessive usury, and at any rate conditional on the situation of the time.  But his real contribution was going further and demolishing the old Scholastic arguments about the unnaturalness of ""money begetting money"", by emphasizing the relationship of credit to economic activity.  ""Why should the lender be cheated of his just due, if the money profits the other man, and he be the richer of the two?"" Calvin outlines his opinion in his juridical consult ""De Usuris"" (Opera, v.10, p.245). Here Calvin states that usury is permissible, but only on commercial loans, and subject to additional conditions, notably, that it never be demanded of the poor & needy, that the lender not be addicted to gain, that there be no further conditions on the loan contract that might be contrary to Christ's commandments, where the borrower will end up profiting more than the lender (i.e. unlawful usury is only that which harms the borrower), that the loan will likely to do more good than harm to the commonwealth, and that the interest charged not exceed maximum limits laid out in other countries.  Calvin's thought on usury were likely influenced by Charles Dumoulin's 1546 tract. ""Calvinism"" is  credited by Max Weber and R.H. Tawney for setting up the social and ideological tone for the capitalist era that was to come much later.      Major Works of John Calvin   Resources on John Calvin   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Nicolas-François Canard, 1750-1833.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/canard.htm,"  French mathematician and lycée teacher in Moulins.  Canard's main contribution to economics arose as an essay submitted in 1801 to an Institut de France contest.   It arose as an attempt to refute the Physiocratic ""single tax"" thesis.  Contrary to the Physiocrats, Canard posited a labor theory of value, specifically that all wealth arises from the application of ""superfluous"" labor.  He identified three sources of income: income from land, income from industry and income from capital.  Echoing Cantillon and drawing an analogy with the circulation of fluids, Canard discussed how these flows need to be balanced to achieve equilibrium and how the forces of individual interest and competition operate to achieve this balance.  He discussed how the economy can be viewed as a system of markets and discusses how equilibrium prices are determined by the balance of opposing forces of buyers and sellers.  Canard won the Institut of France contest with his economics essay and subsequently published it in book version.  In 1802, he won another Institut contest with an essay on justice.  The prestige of these awards conferred upon Canard the blessings of the French academic establishment.  Strikingly, for much of the remainder of the 19th Century, French Liberal School hailed Canard as  the ""last word"" on mathematical economics -- and considered the topic closed.   It is partly for this reason that mathematical economists, particularly Augustin Cournot, struggling to draw attention to their work, felt that the shadow of Canard was being used by the academic establishment to dismiss them.  Out of bitterness, they did their utmost to vilify Canard and denigrate his achievements.  Cournot's bitter evaluation of Canard's Principes put it succinctly:   ""These pretended principles are so radically at fault, and the application of them is so erroneous, that the approval of a distinguished body of men was unable to preserve the work from oblivion.  It is easy to see why essays of this nature should not incline such economists as Say and Ricardo to algebra."" (Cournot, 1838: p.2). Léon Walras considered the awarding of the Institut prize to Canard a ""misfortune"" (Walras, 1874: p.44). Joseph Bertrand argued that ""Citizen Canard, although a professor of mathematics, is ignorant of or forgets the elements of functional calculus....How did he become a laureate of the Institut?  On the recommendation of which commission?  I have not had the indiscretion of seeking it out."" (Bertrand, 1883: p.499-500).  Even a century later, Joseph Schumpeter killed it with faint praise, ""[Canard's] book is, however, far from being the worst that was ever written."" (Schumpeter, 1954: p.499).   Canard has since been somewhat rehabilitated.  It has become generally accepted that Canard's mathematical treatment and conception of the economy anticipated several elements of the general equilibrium system of Léon Walras and the Lausanne School.

Edwin Cannan, 1861-1935.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/cannan.htm," Born in Madeira, Edwin Cannan was the son of a wealthy English businessman.  He was educated at Clifton and Balliol College, Oxford.  As he was independently wealthy, there was no great pressure for him to pursue a clear career, and so he spent much time traveling or leisurely immersed in intellectual activities and political debates. Cannan's initial interest was in the relationship between economic theory and socialist thought (e.g. 1887, 1888), which he did not believe were incompatible with each other.  Cannan's activities in this realm placed him in touch with the Fabian society.   However, Cannan quickly careened off in a completely different direction and became entranced by the promise of the new ""Marginalist Revolution"" breaking out in the wake of Alfred Marshall's Principles.  Indeed, in 1891, Cannan commuted from Oxford to attend Marshall's lectures at Cambridge.  However, Cannan was never a convinced ""Marshallian"", keeping some of their contribution (esp. consumer's surplus) at arm's length. In 1893, after three years of intensive research, Cannan produced his most famous book, A History of the Theories of Production and Distribution in 1893.  With remarkable scholarship, Cannan logically dissected and destroyed the principal tenets of Classical Ricardian theory -- concluding that there was nothing there worth saving.  Although Cannan never regretted taking Ricardo and Mill down a few pegs, he made up for his mistreatment of Adam Smith later on.  In 1895, as luck would have it, Cannan came across a series of lecture notes taken down by a student of Smith's at Glasgow in 1763, which he subsequently edited and published as the Lectures on Jurisprudence.   In 1904, Cannan brought out what was long regarded as the authoritative edition of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. In 1895, perhaps unaware of his new faith, Cannan's Fabian socialist friends invited him to join their new institution, the London School of Economics.  Cannan would teach at the LSE for the remainder of his life (although, stubbornly rooted to his residence in Oxford, he never actually moved to London).  In 1907, Cannan became the chair of the department and he used this position to shepherd the LSE away from its Fabian roots and into a tentative Marshallianism.  His Wealth (1914) presented a watered-down Marshallian economics in a pedagogic style that made it much more accessible to the layman than Marshall's own text.   Cannan retired from the LSE in 1926, handing over the reins of the department to his successor, the American economst Allyn Young.  He used his retirement to prepare his latter-day lecture notes for publication.  The result was his magnificent Review of Economic Doctrines (1927).  Cannan's imprint on the LSE would not last for very long -- for, upon Young's death in 1929, Cannan's own protege,  Lionel Robbins, became chair and took the LSE in a very different direction..

Richard Cantillon, 1680-1734.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/cantillon.htm,"  Richard Cantillon, acknowledged by many historians as the first great economic ""theorist"", is an obscure character. This much is known: he was a British subject, an Irishman, who carved out a career in banking in France during the 1710s  Although there have been many attempts to reconstruct the story of his background from various sources, it has proven contradictory and elusive.  It has been said his family were originally landlords from County Kerry dispossessed of their lands during the confiscations of the 17th C., although they remained well-connected and probably Jacobite.  Young Cantillon is said to have taken French nationality in 1709 and in 1711 might been in the service of James Brydges, Paymaster-General, as financial agent to the British forces in Spain. It only becomes more certain that he moved to Paris in 1714 to launch a career as a merchant banker in the house of a relative (also named Richard Cantillon).  By 1716, Cantillon had either bought his relative out, or launched his own banking house (possibly with financial help from Brydges).  Cantillon got involved early in John Law's schemes, but had little confidence in their success. Cantillon reputedly made a fortune of some twenty million livres by speculating on the collapse of shares in Law's companies in 1720-21, actions which led to multiple lawsuits and even brief arrest by Paris authorities.  Cantillon moved to England thereafter, taking up residence in London.  Cantillon died in 1734 in a fire in his London home - allegedly set by his discharged cook (although there remains speculation that Cantillon set the fire himself, staging his death to escape his lawsuits, and fled abroad - in at least one account, to Surinam). Cantillon's entire reputation rests on his one remarkable treatise, Essai Sur la Nature du Commerce en Général.  Apparently, the Essai was originally written  circa 1732, probably in English and containing a statistical supplement, but this version has since been lost.  It was translated (probably by Cantillon himself) into French for circulation in manuscript form among his friends.  This French version was published anonymously in England in 1755, some twenty years after his death (publication was probably undertaken by his second cousin, Philip Cantillon).  Two other published versions of this essay exist -  a reprint appended to the 1755 French translation of David Hume's Discours Politiques, and a smaller pamphlet version published by another press in 1756.  Prior to these, excerpts (possibly from the missing English original) were liberally plagiarized by Malachy Postlethwayt in his 1749 Universal Dictionary of Trade and Commerce. Cantillon's Essai was well-known in Enlightenment France, admired by Vicent de Gournay, cited by the Physiocrats (e.g. Mirabeau, Quesnay and Turgot) and one of the few works referenced by Adam Smith.  It continued to be read in the 19th C. French school.  However, Cantillon's work fell into relative obscurity in the English-speaking world until resurrected and popularized by William Stanley Jevons in the 1880s. Cantillon was perhaps the first to define long-run equilibrium as the balance of flows of income, thus setting the foundations both for Physiocracy as well as Classical Political Economy. Cantillon's system was is clear and simple and absolutely path-breaking. He developed a two-sector general equilibrium system from which he obtained a theory of price (determined by costs of production) and a theory of output (determined by factor inputs and technology).    He followed up on Petty's conjecture about the par of labor and land, thereby enabling him  to reduce labor to the amount of necessities needed to sustain it and thus making both labor supply and output a function of the land absorption necessary to produce the necessities to feed labor and the luxuries to feed landlords.   By demonstrating that relative prices are reducible to land-absorption rates, Cantillon can be said to have derived a fully-working ""land theory of value"". [click here for a review of Cantillon's system.] In determining the natural wage for his model, Cantillon lays out the wage-fertility dynamics (""men multiply like mice in a barn if they have unlimited means of subsistence""), anticipating the theory developed by Malthus in 1798. Cantillon's careful description of a supply-and-demand mechanism for the determination of short-run market price (albeit not long-run natural price) also stand him as a progenitor of the Marginalist Revolution.  In particular, his insightful notes on entrepreneurship (as a type of arbitrage) have made him a darling of the modern Austrian School. Cantillon was also one of the first (and among the clearest) articulators of the Quantity Theory of Money and attempted to provide much of the reasoning behind it.   Finally, one of the consequences of his theory was that he arrived at a quasi-Mercantilist policy conclusion for a favorable balance of trade but with a twist: Cantillon recommended the importation of ""land-based products"" and the exporting of ""non-land-based"" products as a way of increasing national wealth.

Diomede Carafa, 1406-1487.   ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/carafa.htm,"15th Century Neapolitan soldier and statesman. Diomede Carafa, Count of Maddaloni was a loyalist of the house of Aragon in Naples.  As a soldier, Carafa had assisted the Alfonso V of Aragon in the conquest of Naples in 1442 from the Angevins.  Carafa went on to become a favorite advisor to his son King Ferdinand I (""Ferrante"") of Naples.  Carafa served as his superintendant of finances  Carafa had a famous Renaissance palace built for himself in Naples in 1466. Carafa wrote several memoirs on political, moral and military affairs.  His most famous memoir, De Regis, is perhaps one of the first handbooks of economic governance.  Unlike many of his contemporaries, he did not focus on princely education and ideal statesmanship, but on government ""as is"".  Particularly valuable is his articulation of  the principles of state finances and concern with the details of the economic conditions of a country.   He places the revenues from the royal demesne as the central part of the government revenues, upon which expenditures should be limited, subordinating taxes to an accessory role and urging moderation in both levies and expenditures. De Regis was originally written in Italian, composed by a semi-retired Carafa as letter to his former protege,  Ferrante's daughter Eleanor, who had recently married Ercole d'Este, Duke of Ferrara.  Eleanor arranged for its translation into Latin by the Ferrarese luminary Guarini, and it circulated in various European courts.  It was finally published in 1688.

Henry C. Carey, 1793-1879.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/carey.htm," American publisher, writer and economist, primary theorist and one of the chief proponents of the protectionist ""American System"". Originally from Philadelphia, Henry Charles Carey inherited his publishing business and his economic ideas from his father, Matthew Carey.  An Irish nationalist and political refugee, Matthew Carey had emigrated to Philadelphia, and soon entered the book and publishing trade.  An enthusiast of Alexander Hamilton, Matthew Carey was a leading proponent of protectionist tariffs and founded the Society for the Promotion of American Industry in Philadelphia for the purpose in the 1810s.  For the next half-century, US politics were torn in repeated controversies over foreign tariffs.   Industrialists from the north lobbied for high tariffs to protect the fledgling American manufacturing from competition from industrial Britain, while agrarian plantation lords from the south insisted on keeping them low, to facilitate foreign trade.  The acrimonious struggle over the tariff went back and forth, frequently provoking the near-secession of states from the Union (e.g. during South Carolina's ""nullificatoin crisis"" of 1832). The third child (and eldest son) Henry C. Carey joined Carey & Lea in 1814, and took over the publishing house of Carey & Lea on Matthew's retirement 1821. Henry was 28 years old at the time.  In 1835, at the age of 42, Henry C. Carey and retired from business  to dedicate himself to writing.  Drawing from Senior, Carey's first work (1835) was an examination on the wages-fund doctrine, disputing Ricardo's assertion that higher profits can be achieved by lower wages.   Carey's next work, Principles of Political Economy (1837-40) was largely conventional, and compatible with  classical Ricardian theory. Henry C. Carey resuming writing after an interruption, producing his seminal The Past, the Present and the Future in 1848, where he introduced his famous ""hilliside"" theory of rent. Rejecting the classical Ricardian theory, arguing that increasing agriculture moves from comparatively less fertile to more fertile lands, thereby reversing the Ricardian theory.  Carey proposes the mental exercise of settlers arriving in a virgin valley, and notes that the most fertile lands, at the bottom of the valley, tend to be most cluttered with trees, vegetation, and underbrush that have to be cleared first, so early settlers tend to first cultivate the less fertile hillside, being more accessible with sparser vegetation.  And will only later move, as extent of agriculture expands, to the more fertile lands in the valley.  On the basis of this, Carey also rejects the Malthusian population doctrine, arguing that increasing returns to scale in agriculture will allow increasing population. Carey picked up Senior's point on decreasing fertility, and argued that eventually there would be a balance between subsistence and population. ""great law of molecular gravitation"" applying an analogue of the Newtonian theory of gravitation to human society.  Carey took up his father's standard most forcefully.  Carey promoted the idea of an ""American system""  a combination of high tariffs, internal improvements (roads, canals, harbors, etc.), a national currency and balanced budgets that he asserted was essential for American economic development.  It was held up in contrast to the "" British system"" of laissez faire free-trade.  At least as far as foreign trade was concerned. In domestic economy, Carey was a proponent of optimistic 'harmony' doctrines, not dissimilar to liberals like Bastiat. Unlike his father, Carey was not, however, merely a polemicist, but looked to back up his arguments with detailed economic studies and statistics.  Carey initial ideas were laid out in the Principles (1837-38) which had some dissemination both in the US and abroad, and quoted approvingly on the political stage (e.g. by Henry Clay's Whigs).  Carey followed it up with smaller tracts, elaborating on specific points.  In older age, Carey tried to gather his ideas together in a monumental treatise, Principles of Social Science in 1858-59.  Carey attacked the principles of Adam Smith and the classical British economists as not only being inapplicable and even detrimental to the American economy, but as being wrong in themselves.  Not only wrong on trade, but also wrong on population, rent, wages and value.  In Past, Present & Future (1848), Carey introduced his famous ""hillside"" theory of cultivation, arguing that increasing the scale agriculture moves from comparatively less fertile to more fertile lands, thereby reversing the Ricardian theory.  Carey proposes the mental exercise of settlers arriving in a virgin valley, and notes that the most fertile lands, at the bottom of the valley, tend to be most cluttered with trees, vegetation, and underbrush that have to be cleared first, so early settlers tend to first cultivate the less fertile hillside, being more accessible with sparser vegetation.  And will only later move, as extent of agriculture expands, to the more fertile lands in the valley. However, Carey's efforts at constructing his own alternative economic theory were not very successful, and  much disparaged by economists for their vulgarity and inconsistency..  Carey's theoretical efforts seemed to be closer to the land theories of value of Cantillon and the Physiocrats.   Nonetheless, Carey is mostly remembered for connecting protectionism to economic development, and usually compared to his German ""nationalist"" contemporary Frederick List. Carey's high-water moment came with the passage of the Morrill Tariff in 1863, introducing protectionist tariffs in the United States.  In the aftermath of the Civil War, Henry Carey urged the continuance and even increase of the tariff, and argued for a  reduction in internal taxes, and the elimination of the wartime income tax..  Carey also emerged as a leading proponent of ""easy money"",  arguing against the resumption of specie payments and the maintenance of inconvertible notes.  He welcomed the depreciation of the dollar to gold as acting as an effective tariff barrier. Carey was highly influential in his day, arguably the single most influential American economist of the 19th Century.  The core of his support was among the industrialists of Pennsylvania, and the the University of Pennsylvania made Carey required reading for students.        Major Works of Henry C.

Thomas Carlyle, 1795-1881,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/carlyle.htm,"  Highly influential Scottish essayist, historian and social critic, Thomas Carlyle was a gloomy romantic sage and a passionate denouncer of bourgeois liberalism and the industrial era.   Carlyle was born in Ecclefechan, Scotland, to a modest but strongly Puritanical family.  In 1809, Carlyle managed to enroll at the University of Edinburgh. With undistinguished performance, he finished his coursework in 1814.  Thereafter, Carlyle taught mathematics at schools in Annan and then Kirkcaldy.   In 1818, he moved to Edinburgh, where he worked as a private tutor and did some hack work for an encyclopedia..   Carlyle studied law half-heartedly for a while, but literature continued to pull at him.   All the while he was still thinking of a career in the Church of Scotland.  However, Carlyle was swept up by the literature of German Romanticism -- particularly, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.  In a famous incident on Leith Walk in June 1821, Carlyle converted himself from a Puritanical Christian (the ""Everlasting No"") to a Puritanical Pagan (the ""Everlasting Yea"").   Carlyle gave up on the Church definitively  .   In 1824, Carlyle published a biography of Friedrich Schiller, translated Goethe's great novel, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship and Legendre's Elements of Geometry and Trigonometry.  This provided a modicum of the financial wherewithal to support himself as a writer.    In 1827, he produced a series of translations of German Romantics.  In 1827-1833, Carlyle threw himself into the journal world by publishing essays on German literature in the Edinburgh Review, the Foreign Review and Fraser's Magazine.  It was largely through Carlyle that the two great streams of European Romanticism -- English and German --  were finally introduced to each other.  Carlyle was also quite attracted to ""scientific"" romanticism of Saint-Simonism.  In 1826, after an unconventional courtship, Carlyle married Jane Baillie Welsh and, soon afterwards, moved to Craigenputtock in rural Scotland.  The American essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson made a pilgrimage to the remote Carlyle home.   On an 1831 jaunt to London, Carlyle made the acquaintance of John Stuart Mill.   Carlyle soon tired of rusticism, and hankering for a return to urban civilization, the Carlyles moved to London in 1834 and set themselves up on Cheyne Row in Chelsea.   In 1833-4, Carlyle published his Sartor Resartus, a medley of satire, philosophy and autobiography.  It turned out to be a distinctively Romanticist manifesto -- albeit not in the sense of wide-eyed utopianism, but rather in the more subtle (and mystical) German sense of individual freedom combined with external order.  For the Romanticists, the end of human activity was activity itself.  The social context in which activity is pursued does not matter.  Socialists may rail against society's restrictions on individual freedom, but society has always been and always will be restrictive. Reversing the famous Rosseauvian dictum, Schiller had asserted ""Man is free, even though he is born in chains"".   For the Romanticists, it was not ""natural"" to up-end society to match the individual's aspirations; the individual should find his ""place"" in society and work happily within that.  For Carlyle, this sounded like the old Puritan ethic of his youth, secularly enhanced.   This was the message he believed German Romanticism had tried to export. Carlyle was merely translating it to the British public in his inimitable style. However, there was one social feature that, in Carlyle's view, went dead-against this vision -- namely, the market system.  For the bourgeois capitalist society, the end of human activity is selling, including the selling of labor.  The market system does not reward hard work itself but rather it only rewards salesmanship.  For Carlyle, the Capitalist ""commercial"" ethic and the Puritan ""work"" ethic are incompatible.  Carlyle's opposition to bourgeois capitalism was not a socialist opposition, but rather a ""neo-feudal"" opposition (if such a term can be allowed).  But Carlyle is not hankering for some rural utopia or pastoral romance.  Rather, for Carlyle, the feudal system's sole value is that it is much better at assigning a man ""his"" activity -- and thereafter granting him the freedom to pursue it in any manner he pleases.  In contrast, a market system assigns him no activity whatsoever.  But the market simultaneously becomes the hardest taskmaster of all because it forces individuals to chase the wage, chase the profit and serve it.   In Carlyle's view, it is ""unnatural"" for people to pursue consumption and accumulation  instead of activity itself.   Thus, for Carlyle, the feudal system may be harsh in limiting social mobility, but it offers freedom of activity at the individual level and the joy of craftsmanship.  In contrast, the market system is socially much more progressive, but at the individual level, it forces everybody into the unnatural activities of selling, gaining and acquiring.    The 1830s, of course, were the height of bourgeois agitation in favor of market capitalism.   The 1832 Parliament Reform Act had, in effect, transferred political power in Britain from the landed aristocracy to the commercial bourgeoisie.  A couple of years later, the Poor Laws were repealed, creating a nationwide labor market.  Slavery was abolished in 1833.  The free trade movement movement was at its height around this time and the last bastion of the old landed interests, the Corn Laws, would be repealed by 1846.   Carlyle threw his weight behind the opposition to all these steps.  In his 1839 Chartism, Carlyle threw his weight behind the Chartists not because he was a friend of democracy, but rather because he saw rule by the working masses as the only way to prevent ""rule by the shopkeepers"".     Carlyle passionate opposition to bourgeois capitalism is captured in his Chartism (1840) and, especially, Past and Present (1843), a book much admired by  Frederick Engels. Carlyle condemns economists and their laissez-faire doctrines with the fury of an Old Testament prophet.  In his view, economics is pure apologism for the bourgeois capitalist ethos, the ideological and religious buttress of the industrial revolution.     At one point, he even recommended that economists ought to be ""popularly elected"" as a way to make them accountable to the population that their theories were helping ruin.  It was Carlyle who later characterized economics as ""the dismal science"".  Nonetheless, throughout all this, he remained a good friend of that most bourgeois of economists -- John Stuart Mill.   Carlyle's darkest moment was perhaps the publication of his infamous defense of slavery (in his 1849 Fraser's Magazine) and his venomous Latter-Day Pamphlets (1850).  His attack on economics was most explicit here: ""Truly, my philanthropic friends, Exeter Hall [evangelical abolitionist] Philanthropy is wonderful; and the Social Science—not a “gay science,” but a rueful — which finds the secret of this universe in “supply-and-demand,” and reduces the duty of human governors to that of letting men alone, is also wonderful. Not a “gay science,” I should say, like some we have heard of; no, a dreary, desolate, and indeed quite abject and distressing one; what we might call, by way of eminence, the dismal science. These two, Exeter Hall Philanthropy and the Dismal Science, led by any sacred cause of Black Emancipation, or the like, to fall in love and make a wedding of it,—will give birth to progenies and prodigies; dark extensive moon-calves, unnameable abortions, wide-coiled monstrosities, such as the world has not seen hitherto!""  (Thomas Carlyle, ""Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question"", 1849, Fraser's Magazine) The shamelessly racist tone of his diatribe were not well-received even in his day.  But it was his attacks on the Evangelical Christian abolitionism which were the main sore point with Victorian society.  He lost most of his friends and admirers over this -- including John Stuart Mill (who responded with his own article in Fraser's Magazine).  Mill and Carlyle clashed again in the late 1860s when Carlyle took actively took up the defense of Governor Edward John Eyre's brutal suppression of an uprising by blacks in Jamaica.  (See our special page on the the Carlyle-Mill ""Negro Question"" debate). Needless to say, his arguments in defense of slavery were not logically inconsistent with his general social philosophy, they were just taking it to an extreme degree and expressed in an extreme tone.  Theoretically, Carlyle saw little difference between a black slave in a slave society and a joyous yeoman in a feudal society-- except that one is loyally bound to his task by chains and whips, and the other by tradition and custom.  In either case, the ""joy of work"" is (eventually) achieved.  Add to this the ""happy slaves"" propaganda of the American southerners and their ""Gone with the Wind"" feudal mimicry, add to this his own personal racism and gloominess, add his always exaggerated writing style, add the urgency of his message and the need to ""turn up the volume"", and, finally, add the pleasure he took in offending the pious and sanctimonious evangelical Christians he despised (with a provocative glee), and the extremity of his 1849-50 writings may be contextually clearer.

But neither a feudal society nor a slave society are being ""recommended"" by Carlyle.  His early flirtation with Saint-Simonism, which embraced industrial society (but tried to rationalize it) proves that he was not a traditionalist, much less a master-and-slave feudalist.  The main issue, the only issue, was the ""man-must-work"" principle.  How this can be achieved in an industrial society, he did not know nor did he have practical policy suggestions for.  He was a man of letters.  He wrote to shock.  Carlyle is most often compared and paired with his friend and Victorian critic John Ruskin, who had a similar romantic indisposition to market society and industrialism.

Charles Holt Carroll, 1799-1890,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/carroll.htm,"American businessman, writer of a series of articles on currency questions in the late 19th C.  Little is known of Charles Holt Carroll save that he was self-identified as ""a merchant from Massachusetts"".  Further investigations by historians has unearthed that Charles H. Carroll was born in Charlestown, Mass. and eventually set himself up as a merchant in Baltimore in the late 1820s (this has led to confused allegations that Charles H. Carroll was related to the prominent patrician Carroll family of Maryland planters). Carroll moved back to Massachusetts in 1849, setting up a leather goods business in Boston.  He retired around 1860. Charles Holt Carroll's principal contributions are a series of articles on banking and currency, primarily published in Hunt's Merchants' Magazine & Commercial Review, from 1855 to 1879.

Thomas Nixon Carver, 1865-1961,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/carver.htm,"  Thomas Nixon Carver was an American economist, and long-time professor at Harvard. Born in rural Iowa, the son of a Quaker farmer.  Carver's early education was rudimentary, and he seemed destined for a farming life. By his own confession he never showed much aptitude for school, and despite never attending high school,  nonetheless decided to enroll in Iowa Wesleyan University in 1882 on a whim. His studies, however, were repeatedly interrupted by farm work. In 1887, Carver left Iowa, and accompanied his father and brothers to southern California, where they had decided to set up a new farm.  He was soon married, and decided to resume his collegiate career, enrolling at the University of Southern California (USC), obtaining his B.A. in 1891.  During his USC period, Carver came across the philosophy of .Herbert Spencer, the subject of his first publication.  Carver decided on an academic career, and went to Baltimore to pursue graduate studies at the Johns Hopkins University.  Although he had never studied economics before, he enrolled in the program under Kinley.  Despite his inadequate preparation, Carver flourished at Hopkins. R.T. Ely was on his way out, and Hopkins made up for it with the appointment of Sidney Sherwood, and invited lectures from John Bates Clark and Henry C. Adams. Carver was thus present for the conversion of Johns Hopkins to the Marginalist Revolution.  Carver joined Sherwood's study group, where he was introduced to the works of Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and Alfred Marshall.  This would lead to his 1893 QJE article on abstinence and interest.  Financial difficulties, however, forced Carver to transfer in his final year from Hopkins to take up a fellowship at Cornell.  Carver 1894 QJE article on wages and value (an expansion on Clark) was submitted as his Ph.D thesis at Cornell.  Carver promptly took up an appointment as a assistant professor in economics and sociology at Oberlin College, an undergraduate liberal arts college in Ohio, where he would remain for the next few years.  In 1900, Harvard president Charles W. Eliot plucked Carver out of Oberlin and installed him as assistant professor at Harvard (to replace Dunbar).  By a series of coincidences (Ashley's resignation,  Taussig's breakdown), within a year, Carver found himself as the only remaining faculty member at Harvard!  Carver plugged in the missing holes with junior lecturers (Sprague, Andrews) and outside hires (Ripley, Bullock, Gay).  But Taussig was back by late 1903, and re-asserted his central place in the department.  Carver was full professor at  Harvard by 1902, and would remain there for the next thirty years.

Gustav Cassel, 1866-1945.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/cassel.htm," Swedish Neoclassical economist. Originally from a wealthy family of Stockholm, Gustav Cassel started off his studies in engineering, but soon shifted over to pure mathematics.  Cassel submitted an ambitious dissertation on automorphic functions to earn his doctorate from the University of Uppsala in 1894. Cassel went on to teach mathematics in Stockholm, but soon tired of it, and instead turned his attention to economics, hoping to bring his mathematical tools to bear on the field.  Cassel came across the work of Walras and the Lausanne School, and already in 1899,  published an article in the German journal outlining the formalization of general equilibrium theory (the Walras-Cassel System).that he would bring to fruition two decades later. After a period of foreign travel and a flurry of articles in German, English and Swedish journals, Cassel began to make a name for himself as an economist, and particularly an expert in monetary economics, while looking for an academic perch.  In 1901, Cassel failed in his candidacy for the new professorship of economics at Lund University (it went to Knut Wicksell).  He tried again in 1904, for the economics chair being created at Stockholm University (then called Stockholms Högskola) and this time he succeeded.  Cassel remained professor of economics (""national economy and finance"") at Stockholm until his retirement in 1933.  Gustav Cassel has the unfortunate distinction of belonging to that distinct group of influential economists who are intensely disliked by everyone. The Stockholm School, where he taught for many years, did its utmost to dissociate itself from him due to Cassel's bitter rivalry with their beloved master, Knut Wicksell. Although Walrasians applauded his general equilibrium work, they cringed at his attacks on utility theory. The Marshallians disliked him for exactly the opposite reason. The Austrians resented him for having helped bury Böhm-Bawerk's theory of capital and interest. And, finally, the Keynesians have no love for one of the most vociferous opponents of Keynesian Revolution.  All this was not helped by Cassel's abrasive personality and his refusal to acknowledge others' work.  As Hans Brems notes: ""A writer less generous than Cassel would be hard to find. Marx at least paid tribute to Quesnay and Ricardo. Cassel paid tribute to nobody. Walras had written the first system of simultaneous equations of general equilibrium. Pareto had purged it of any measure of sensations. Cassel followed both but mentioned neither...We must not treat Cassel the way he treated others. We must respect him as a pioneer."" (H. Brems, 1981: p.158) Nonetheless, despite all the antipathy, Gustav Cassel has remained a silent giant in 20th century economics. Cassel maintained the Lausanne torch alight with his magnificent Theory of Social Economy (written before WWI, but only published in German in 1918 and translated to English in 1923). However, there were a few bizarre twists: marginal productivity was dumped in favor fixed coefficient technology; utility theory, following up on his 1899 contribution, is dropped by the wayside. In his opinion: ""This purely formal [utility] theory, which in no way extends our knowledge of actual processes, is in any case superfluous for the theory of prices...[T]his deduction of the nature of demand from a single principle, in which so much childish pleasure has been taken, was only made possible by artificial constructions and a considerable distortion of reality."" (Gustav Cassel, Theory of Social Economy1918: p.81). Nonetheless, the Cassel's general equilibrium system on the basis of demand functions was the reading material of the Vienna Colloquium in the 1930s and the fundamental contributions of John von Neumann and Abraham Wald, which did so much to create modern Neo-Walrasian economics would not have occurred had Cassel not written his text.  It was through his work that the concept of a ""steady-state growth"" equilibrium was introduced. [see review of the Walras-Cassel system.] Among his other contributions is the rudiments of a ""purchasing power parity"" theory of exchange rates (1921) and an ""overconsumption"" theory of the trade cycle (1918). His Nature and Necessity of Interest (1903), in turn, was an attempt at resurrecting Walras's theory of capital.  He also worked on the German reparations problem. His review of Keynes's General Theory in 1937 was one of the most critical. Alongside his academic career, Cassel was also regular contributor to the Swedish political press, usually in the conservative Svenska Dagbladet. Presenting himself as a technocrat, Cassel sat on numerous committees for the Swedish government and the central bank (Riksbank). He also published numerous pamphlets advising (or criticizing) the economic policies of the government or the opposition.  His condemnation of the Social Democrats' program before the 1928 elections was notoriously harsh.      Major works of Gustav Cassel Resources on Gustav Cassel   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Cassiodorus, c.485-c.585,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/cassiodorus.htm,"Late Roman historian and civil servant in Ostrogoth Italy, Cassiodorus was a critical figure in transmitting Classical knowledge into the Middle Ages. Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus originated from a Roman senatorial family in Scyllacium (Squillace, Calabria), southern Italy, shortly after the fall of the western Roman Empire in 476.  Following his father's footsteps, Cassiodorus entered a career in the civil service of the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy, beginning as quaestor in 507 at a young age (as a result, some estimate his birth to be earlier, in 477 or even 470).  After climbing through the Gothic bureaucracy, Cassiodorus availed himself of the fall of Boethius in 523 to become magister officium, head of the civil service of Theodoric the Great, Ostrogoth king of Italy. After Theodoric's death in 526, Cassiodorus stayed on as the head of the bureaucracy for his daughter Amalsontha, regent on behalf of her young son king Athalaric.  After Amalontha's deposition in 535, Cassiodorus still continued to hold positions in the new administration. During this political period, Cassiodorus wrote several works glorifying the Gothic Italian state, including a chronicle of Italy up to 519, a history of the Goths (now lost) and a collection of state papers (Variae).  The advent of the devastating Byzantine-Gothic wars in Italy in 535, and subsequent disorder, prompted Cassiodorus to retire from public life around 540, and moved to his family estate in Calabria, and subsequently to Constantinople.  Before leaving, Cassiodorus set up a monastery at Vivarium (location uncertain, prob. on family estates near Catanzaro, Calabria). Cassiodorus spent a quiet decade in Constantinople, primarily writing ecclesiastical works (he wrote his appendix on the soul, a Church history and commentaries on the Psalms and epistles in this period), before returning to Italy and entering his own monastery in 554.  In the hopes of preserving what remained of Classical thought in crumbling Italy, Cassiodorus stocked the Vivarium monastery with his own private library, and set his monks at translating, summarizing and copying whatever books they could find from Greek and Latin sources. To overcome the wariness of the Church towards pagan Classical literature, in his letters and works, notably the Institutiones (c.543-55), Cassiodorus promulgated the usefulness of a Classical education, however pagan, as preparatory for the proper study of Christian theology.  In the Institutiones and his follow-up De artibus (c.560), Cassiodorus outlined a program of education in the 'Seven Liberal Arts', harking back to Capella, pointing to the existing Classical books and sources that probably could and should be read safely.   It is to Cassiodorus whom is owed the long association between monasteries and books. His De orthographia (c.570) was a writing handbook for his monks.  Cassiodorus's example at Vivarium (at least the book-copying bit) was taken up with fervor by the Benedictine monastery of Monte Cassino not long after, and would eventually spread across European monasteries in the 9th C.

Waddill Catchings, 1879-1969.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/foster.htm#catchings," Pre-Keynesian American underconsumption theorists. In their undergraduate years at the turn of the century, William Trufant Foster and Waddill Cathings had been classmates together in at Harvard.  Foster went on to become an college educator, while Catchings had gone into finance.  In 1919, they came together again at the Pollack Foundation for Economic Research - Catchings providing the economic expertise,  Foster providing the expository rhetoric - and promptly set about addressing the post-war slump. Foster & Catchings main theses were worked out in Profits (1925) and Money (1928).  They argued that insufficient consumer income is what leads to collapses in consumption and hence profits, prices and outputs.  They base their theory on a primitive but clumsy version of a multiplier-accelerator mechanism.   If retained company profits are hoarded (rather than being lent out), then consumer income is insufficient for consumers to absorb output. They argued that even if the firm invests this hoarded money itself (and thus pays the income out to workers), the problem is not solved: increased investment increases demand, yes, but it also pushes out output even further.  The imbalance between aggregate demand and supply, Foster and Catchings argue, will thus maintain itself.  Their theory contains a fatal flaw in the ""long-run"", but seen in a short-run, dynamic manner, it is reminiscent of that of Malthus during the General Glut controversy.  They publicly offered a cash award to any economist who could prove their argument flawed. Dozens upon dozens of people submitted proofs (e.g. Friedrich Hayek, 1929), but while they acknowledged minor errors, Foster and Catchings maintained that their central thesis remained correct.  Apparently, Foster and Catchings had early sympathizers in Paul H. Douglas and Charles F. Roos.   William Trufant Foster, 1879-1950.    W.T.

Edwin Chadwick, 1800-1890,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/chadwick.htm,"  English utilitarian, journalist, activist and social reformer.  Originally from Longsight, a village near Manchester. Chadwick's father, James Chadwick, was a friend of Thomas Paine.  The young Chadwick was given his initial education at the local village school until the age of ten, when the family moved to London, where he finished off his education with private tutors.  At the age of fifteen, Chadwick was apprenticed to a law office in London, and in 1823 was admitted as a law student at the Inner Temple..  To make a living while studying, Chadwick turned to journalism, serving for a while on the Morning Herald and the Examiner.  He was finally admitted to the bar in 1830. It was primarily through his work as a journalist that Edwin Chadwick came into contact with Benthamite utilitarian circles in London.   Chadwick joined the Utilitarian Society, and was an active participant in meetings and debates with young utilitarians like John Stuart Mill and George Grote.  Chadwick wrote his first scholarly article in 1828 for the utilitarian Westminster Review on insurance, a vigorous defense of the Friendly Societies. This brought him to the attention of the Oxford economists Richard Whately and Nassau William Senior, who proceeded to invite Chadwick to contribute a couple of articles to their own fledgling publication, the London Review.  The first  issue of the London Review included Chadwick's famous 1829 article on the police, an excoriating exposition of the antiquated Parochial Watch of London, which had a considerable role in helping the passage of Peel's police reform act. Chadwick's early articles, all of them touching on a variety of policy propositions for social reform with utilitarian enthusiasm, brought him to the attention of  Jeremy Bentham himself. Bentham hired Chadwick as his literary secretary in 1831.  Chadwick would live in Bentham's home, and go on to receive a generous legacy from Bentham upon his death twelve months later.  As the ""last disciple"" of Bentham, Chadwick enthusiastically absorbed the deeper and more mature ideas of Bentham's later years, which tended to baffle Bentham's older disciples.  Chadwick felt a personal obligation to carry them on after Bentham's death in 1832.  In particular, Chadwick embraced Bentham's views on the administration of social reform, especially Bentham's belief in the establishment of centralized national (rather than local) systems of control and the use of paid bureaucratic officials (""contract management"") rather than unpaid amateur local gentry (""trusteeship""), as administrators. When the Poor Laws Commission was assembled in 1832 under Nassau William Senior, Chadwick was brought in to assist.  Chadwick was appointed assistant commissioner responsible for collecting information on London and Berkshire, one of the most important districts - London for its mass of urban poor, Berkshire as the home of the Speenhamland system for the agricultural poor. Chadwick was the only assistant commissioner paid a retainer, to allow him to focus on his task.   Chadwick delivered his results in January, 1833. It was considered the best of the assistant reports and promptly published in its entirety in the 1833 Extracts.  Chadwick's analysis impressed Henry Brougham (then the Lord Chancellor), who pushed to have Chadwick upgraded to full commissioner in April 1833. Chadwick analyzed the problems of the existing Poor Laws not in terms of Malthusian population doctrines (Chadwick eschewed the Malthusian doctrine) but rather on the basis of disincentives to work and the eating away of the wages fund.  Although the analysis echoed with with Senior's own, their remedies differed somewhat.   Chadwick's report contained very specific recommendations (1833, p.338):  an end to outdoor relief, a return to the workhouse system, the abolition of the law of settlement, but also the adoption of a centralized system run by salaried officials (a reiteration of Bentham's own favored pauper-management system).  The more centralized aspects of Chadwick's system were diluted in Senior's summary of the report and sidelined in the final Poor Law Reform Act of 1834 (4 & 5 William 4 c.17).  Somewhat disappointed, Chadwick publicized his views on the Poor Laws in an 1836 Edinburgh Review article.  Chadwick remained on as a secretary with the Poor Law Commission.  Already before the final act, Chadwick's  interests were gravitating elsewhere - notably towards public health and sanitation, which would become the central obsession of the remainder of his career.  Chadwick's 1842 report was a pioneering work in that area, connecting public ill-health and diseases to poverty and working conditions, that eventually led to the Public Health Act of 1848. After the dissolution of the Poor Law Commission in 1847, Chadwick continued the avenue he had begun, working as a commissioner at the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers and the General Board of Health, until his retirement in 1854. Chadwick was elected to the Political Economy Club in 1834 and president of Section F of the BAAS in 1862.  In 1884, he was made the first president of Association of Public Sanitary Inspectors.

George Chalmers, 1742-1825,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/georgechalmers.htm," Scottish writer, historian and occasional economist. George Chalmers originated from Fochabers in Moray, Scotland.  After being educated at the local grammar school, Chalmers enrolled at the University of Aberdeen, coming under the tutelage of Thomas Reid.  Chalmers pursued a legal career, studying law at Edinburgh for several years.   In 1763, George Chalmers emigrated to America, initially accompanying his uncle, and eventually set himself up as a lawyer in Baltimore, Maryland.  During the colonial troubles, the politically-active Chalmers staked a strongly loyalist position.  On the outbreak of the American Revolutionary war in 1775, finding his situation unsafe, Chalmers returned to Britain and settled in London. George Chalmers's early works pertain to the American situation (e.g. 1777, 1780, 1782).  In 1782, Chalmers put out his great exercise in political arithmetic, the Estimate of the Comparative Strength of Great Britain, which would  be updated and go through multiple editions over the next couple decades. Chalmers put out three anonymous pamphlets in 1785 supporting Pitt-Rose plans for liberalizing trade with Ireland, in the hope of binding the island closer to Britain. In 1786, George Chalmers became chief clerk of the Privy Council Committee charged with ""the considerations of all matters relating to trade and foreign plantations"", and served on that committee for the next half-century, until his death.  The position gave Chalmers access to all archives on trade and colonial affairs, which he would use to update his Estimate and put out other economic works. The light obligations of the Privy Council committee gave Chalmers time to engage in a variety of literary pursuits. He produced biographical sketches for Daniel Defoe, Edinburgh librarian Thomas Ruddiman, Scottish poets Allan Ramsay, Sir David Lyndsay, Robert Henryson and Tudor poets Sir John Davies and Thomas Churchyard. The appearance of Thomas Paine's Rights of Man in 1791, at the height of the French Revolution stoked Chalmers's painful loyalist memories from America. Under the pseudonym ""Francis Oldys"", Chalmers published the scurrilous :Life of Paine in 1791, which was little more than a character-assassination of Paine.  Chalmers got repeatedly embroiled in some arcane literary controversies, e.g. on a set of forged Shakespeare papers (1797), on the Junius letters (1818), etc. Chalmers continued his political arithmetic, updating and putting out further editions of the Estimate (his 1802 edition contains the rediscovery of Gregory King's original 1696 work).  Chalmers made contributions to the debates over the Bullionist Controversy  (e.g. Considerations on Commerce, Bullion and Coin, 1811), and the post-war depression (e.g. State of Great Britain and Ireland, 1817) In the latter part of his life, Chalmers began undertaking an ambitious work, Caledonia, a monumental gazetteer and history of Scotland, which he did not live to complete. His well-regarded 1818 biography of Mary Queen of Scots was a side-effect of his researches..

Thomas Chalmers, 1780-1847 ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/chalmers.htm," Evangelical Scottish divine, economist and social reformer. Born into a well-to-do Scottish merchant family of Austruther, Fife, the sixth of fourteen children.  Thomas Chalmers was educated at a parochial school until the age of twelve, when he enrolled at the University of St. Andrews.  He obtained his divinity degree in 1798 and his license as a preacher in the Presbyterian Kirk of Scotland in 1799.  In 1801, he was posted as an assistant in a small parish in Cavers (near Hawick, on the Scottish borders). In 1803, Chalmers was ordained and became minister to the parish of Kilmany (not far from St. Andrews). He would remain here for the next twelve years. Chalmers commitment to the ministry was originally lukewarm, seeing it as merely a stepping stone to an academic career.  Chalmers passion was mathematics and sciences, and his 1799-1801 interlude were partly spent at the University of Edinburgh, attending Dugald Stewart's lectures on philosophy and political economy and Playfair's lectures on mathematics and science.  During his early years as minister in Kilmany, Chalmers was usually down the road at St. Andrews during the week, giving lectures in mathematics and chemistry (at first inside the university, and later outside of it, on his own).   However, Chalmers attempts to teach were frowned upon by both university and church.  After repeated failures to secure a chair at a Scottish university, Chalmers entertained launching a political career.  To that end, Chalmers delved into economics literature (esp. Adam Smith), and in 1808, authored his first economics-related tract, on the impact of the Continental blockade.  It is considered by some to be his best - or certainly his most original - economics work. Chalmers's life took a dramatic spiritual turn around 1810 when he was asked to write an article on ""Christianity"" for Brewsters's Edinburgh Encyclopedia (the article was later re-printed as ""Evidences on Christianity"").  In the course of his research for the topic, Chalmers experienced a life-changing conversion to evangelical Christianity.  Chalmers' ""Evidences"" article provoked a little theological storm in Scotland. Chalmers denounced rationalist 'natural theology' of Paley & co., rejecting it as unscientific speculation (relying partly on Hume's critique) and practically useless in evangelicizing, and recommended instead a 'historical' approach to evidence of revelation. Attacks on Chalmers's thesis, even charges of heresy, were mounted by opponents (e.g. Duncan Mearns of Aberdeen), but it only helped spread his ideas further.  Chalmers mounted a defense of evangelical movement (hitherto regarded as irrational ""enthusiasm""), as properly rational religion, and its reliance on 'revealed theology' as more scientifically sound than the 'natural theology' preferred by the formal establishment. Gripped by his new evangelical fervor, Chalmers set aside his other ambitions and threw himself earnestly into his ministry.  In 1815, Chalmers moved to Glasgow, taking up position initially at the Tron Church.  Chalmers quickly made a name for himself as a vigorous preacher, organizer of bible societies and charities and tireless chapel-builder.  His scientific tastes were not altogether dulled, and he shot to international fame with his discourses on astronomy (delivered 1815-16, published 1817), defending the compatibility of science and religion. The University of Glasgow conferred on Chalmers his D.D. in 1816. It was while he was minister in Glasgow that Chalmers came face to face with the mass poverty of urban industrial slums. Not missing a beat, he resolved on a campaign of poor relief, a mix ofpaternalistic Christian charity and laissez faire economics.  Unlike in England, Scottish Poor Laws were local and usually voluntary.  Poor rates were traditionally collected and disbursed by the established Presbyterian Church, usually in the form of outdoor relief.   In 1733, the city of Glasgow erected a ""Hospital"" (workhouse/poorhouse), financed by local rates  Although collaborating at first, the Church and the Glasgow Hospital directors eventually entered into conflict with each other over the partition of administration and financing.  This reached an apex in 1817, when the surge of unemployed led the directors to launch plans for a additional Hospital.  A champion of private charity, Chalmers entered the fray, opposing the city's proposal to make rates legally compulsory.  Chalmers believed the rates should remain voluntary, and that a portion of funds raised for poor relief would be more adequately spent on funding the erection of churches, to ""encourage"" religious spirit among the public, which would simultaneously decrease poverty and increase voluntary donations.  Chalmers articulated his ""cure"" for poverty in sermons, pamphlets and articles in the Edinburgh Review.  The city of Glasgow decided to give Chalmers's ideas an experimental run, and and in 1819 transferred him to the Church of St. John, where he was given charge of the parish funds for poor relief, to apply them according to his schemes.  In 1822, he undertook a visit to England, to research its poor laws, and met (among others) Rev. Thomas Malthus. In 1823, Chalmers gave up the pulpit to become a professor of moral philosophy at the University of St. Andrews, and took the opportunity to give a series of lectures on political economy.  Thomas Chalmers's Christian and Civic Economy (1821-26) and more expansively in his Political Economy (1832), were attempts to reconcile rising field of economics with Christian principles and ethics, thus overcoming resistance of clergymen and universities to studying it.  Chalmers articulated a roughly classical point of view, albeit more faithfully in the line of Thomas Malthus than Ricardo.  Indeed, in several ways, Chalmers may be regarded as Malthus's one true disciple. Jumping into the economic controversies of the 1820s, Chalmers  gave a strong defense of the Malthusian positions on both the population question (seeing it as an argument for expanding Christian education among the poor) and  general gluts.  He went further than Malthus in emphasizing the role of demand (e.g. p.98). He also went further in his general suspicion of foreign trade (or rather, finding free trade excessively fetishized by economists).  Although Chalmers cherished his 1832 Political Economy as the culmination of his economics, it was poorly received.  It earned a rebuke by McCulloch in the Edinburgh Review, whom Chalmers deigned to respond with a follow-up tract.  Nonetheless, Chalmers reputation survived it, even if a bit damaged.  Chalmers provided evidence to several parliamentary committees, most famously the Doyle Committee on the State of the Poor in Ireland in 1830 (Chalmers backed Catholic emancipation back in 1829, albeit opposed Parliamentary Reform in 1832).  Chalmers was also a member of the BAAS, rising to vice-president of Section F (Economics & Statistics) in 1840. By this time, Chalmers had already left St. Andrews, taking up the prestigious chair of  theology at the University of Edinburgh in 1828.  Despite the new field, Chalmers still managed to teach political economy (e.g. in 1830-31) and finish his 1832 Political Economy treatise, before focusing more full-heartedly on theology again. Chalmers put out a 1833 essay as part of the Bridgewater Treatises, in which he mitigated some of his earlier stridency against natural religion.  But Chalmers remained a committed evangelical and an active supporter of voluntary associations and congregational rights inside the established Presbyterian Church of Scotland.  This soon came into collision with the State-supported ""right of patronage"" (i.e. the right of the person who finances the erection of a church to appoints its minister).  The issue of the right of parishioners to elect their ministers (and, more pointedly, rejecting a minister appointed by ""patronage"") had been long-gestating issue inside the church. The question had theoretical implications as to whether the established Church was a 'creation' of the State, created by parliamentary act and thus subordinate to it and its laws on property, or an autonomous institution, belonging collectively to the Scottish people, which the law only happened to recognize. Chambers was a champion of the ""non-intrusion"" faction inside the church, resisting the State-supported right of patronage, and writing several tracts for the ""democratic"" position.  Things reached a climax in the ""Disruption"" of 1843, when a substantial portion of ministers seceded en masse from the General Assembly of the Church in Edinburgh and went on to form a ""Free Church of Scotland""  Chalmers was elected moderator of the first ""Disruption Assembly"" at Tanfield Hall, in May 1843.  As a result of leaving the established church, Chalmers forfeited his Edinburgh chair.  Chalmers promptly set about raising funds to erect New College, a Free Church-associated theological college in Edinburgh, launched in 1846 (now part of the University of Edinburgh).  He taught divinity at New College and remained an activist for the Free Church until his death in 1847. Ostracized from the establishment after 1843, Chalmers could do little to stop the introduction of compulsory poor rates in Scotland.  These were finally institutionalized in 1845, much to his bitterness.  Chalmers was one of the early contributors of the North British Review, a Christian non-sectarian review established in Edinburgh in 1844, publishing several articles on economic subjects.  In one of his last publications, Chalmers authored a famous 1847 article on the Irish Famine, rejecting it as a self-inflicted problem or Divine Judgment on Irish Catholics, like some evangelicals were prone to do.  Rather, Chalmers asserted Providence lay on Great Britain, and its reaction, and called on the British government, landowners and private Britons to assume responsibility for the relief of Ireland.

Edward H. Chamberlin, 1899-1967.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/chamberlin.htm,"  The American economist Edward H. Chamberlin was educated at Iowa and Michigan, before proceeding on to Harvard, where studied under Allyn A. Young.  His remarkable dissertation, submitted in 1927, introduced the theory of ""monopolistic competition"", later unveiled to the world in his 1933 book.  Chamberlin was immediately appointed to the Harvard faculty, where he would remain for the remainder of his life.   Chamberlin's theory did not unleash a wholesale revolution in microeconomics, as he had hoped, but it effectively launched the field of industrial organization, which had hitherto been hampered by its limitation to two extreme cases, and gave it new concepts and tools of analysis (e.g. product differentiation).  Chamberlin would expend much effort differentiating the theory of monopolistic competition from Joan Robinson's theory of imperfect competition, and defending his theory from attacks by the Chicago School and other critics.

David G. Champernowne, 1912-2000,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/champernowne.htm," Cambridge mathematician, statistician and economist.  While still an undergraduate at King's College, Cambridge, D.G. Champernowne made a mathematical splash with a contribution to normal numbers, what has become known as the ""Champernowne constant"".  Under the influence of Robertson, Pigou and Keynes, Champernowne nonetheless gravitated into economics.  Famously, Champernowne was Keynes's tutorial student and lecture note-taker, and authored one of the initial reviews and expositions of the General Theory in 1936.  Unlike Keynes's other disciples, Champernowne's review was lukewarm, warning that the Keynesian theory might not be as general as all that, that Neoclassical and Keynesian theories might apply in different situations. In 1937, Champernowne won a prize fellowship at King's College (the submitted treatise, on income distribution, was published only in 1973).  And in 1938, Champernowne became a lecturer in statistics at Cambridge, having grown increasingly interested in the subject, particularly Bayesian analysis, perhaps partly on account of lingering influence of the late Ramsey at Cambridge.  During the war, Champernowne was employed by the British government's statistical office and then briefly joined Jewkes at the ministry of aircraft production.  After the war, Champernowne took up a position at Oxford, first as director of the Oxford Institute of Statistics, then from 1948, as professor of statistics.  He was a fellow of Nuffield College during this period. In 1959, Champernowne returned to Cambridge as a reader of economics and fellow of Trinity College, where he would remain for the remainder of his career.  His 1969 trilogy is regarded as the culmination of his work into Bayesian analysis.  Champernowne is famously credited by the Cambridge Keynesians, notably Joan Robinson and Nicholas Kaldor, as a 'behind-the-scenes fixer' of their work, even if he was never quite a subscribing member of their school of thought.

Peter the Chanter, c.1150-1197,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/chanter.htm,"Peter the Chanter (or Peter Cantor), was a French Scholastic philosopher, and a notable and influential teacher at Paris.  Originally from Beauvais, Peter was taught at the cathedral schools of Rheims and later at the school of Notre Dame of Paris, where he is listed as a canon from 1171, and professor of theology,.  Peter gathered a circle of notable followers, such as Robert of Courçon and Thomas of Chobham.  He became a chanter at Notre Dame in 1184, which lent him his nickname.  His election as Bishop of Tournai in 1191 was annulled because of an irregularity.  Elected later as Bishop of Paris, he refused the position and became the dean of the cathedral school at Rheims. Peter the Chanter is known for his extensive Scholastic glosses on the Old and New Testament, the moral work Verbum Abreviatum, addressed to the daily life of monks and clergy, which includes several economic considerations, such as the distinction between ""useful"" and ""not useful"" crafts.  According to Peter, crafts which transform raw materials to something of greater utility, e.g. tanning, shoemaking, weaving, etc. are ""useful"", whereas decorative goldsmithing, carving and painting are ""not useful"".   He also wrote two smaller works, a summary of Church sacramental practice and a brief Scholastic dictionary, the Distinctiones..

Michel Chevalier, 1806-1879.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/chevalier.htm," Michel Chevalier was one of the leaders of the French Liberal School in the mid-19th Century.  Born in Limoges, the son of a shopkeer and bureaucrat. In 1823, the eighteen-year-old Michel Chevalier enrolled at the prestigious École Polytechnique in Paris and went on to become a mine engineer in the Nord department. Around 1829, the youthful Chevalier became a convert to the Saint-Simonian movement, a mystical semi-socialist movement.  Chevalier was an able articulator and vigorous defender movement's principles in their principle organs the daily  Globe and the fortnightly Organisateur. Chevalier quickly discovered a natural talent for writing - as one commentator put it, his pen was able to make every subject seem interesting.  Chevalier would abandon his engineering post in November 1830 to become editor-in-chief of the Globe until its suppression in April 1832.  Among the remarkable articles in this period was Chevalier's Système de la Méditerrannée with a prescient call for governments to embrace railway-building (which had only just been invented) across Europe as an antidote to war.  Chevalier was raised to the rank of ""cardinal"" to the ""Supreme Father"" Enfantin.  In the Summer of 1832, the leaders of the Saint-Simonian sect, including Enfantin and Chevalier, were arrested and charged with spreading immorality and irreligion.  The Saint-Simonians turned up at their trial decked out in their resplendent robes and transformed the courtroom into a theatrical farce that strained the judges' patience.  On August 28, 1832, Chevalier was duly sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a fine of 100 francs. After six months in prison, the duly-sobered Chevalier was released and resumed his engineering career.  His term had been shortened by the French government, conditional on Chevalier's commitment to undertake an study of North American transportation networks.  In late 1833, Chevalier sailed across the Atlantic.  He would spend two years there, researching roads, canals and witnessing the birth of the American railway. He also visited Mexico and Cuba. While in America, Chevalier dispatched a series of letters that were regularly published in the Journal des Débats (they had taken him on as a correspondent) which included wide-ranging reflections of his impression of American economic life and society,    After his return to France in late 1835, Chevalier's collected Lettres on America were collected and published to much acclaim.  His technical report on American transportation was published in 1840.  In 1836, Chevalier secured support for a second trip to the United States, to study the commercial crisis, but the trip was cancelled after Chevalier suffered a vehicle accident on his way to London, forcing him to remain in France.  In November, 1836, Chevalier was given a high administrative post (maître des requêtes) by the government of Louis Mathieu Molé, and went on to be raised to Councillor of State in March 1838.  These were temporary appointments, enabling Chevalier to lend his expertise to assist in Molé's re-organization of the French ministries to encompass railroads and public works. Chevalier developed an ambitious program of public works (1838), which included not only railroads, but also professional education and credit banks.  Much of his plan was shelved after Molé government fell in December 1838, and Chevalier's influence declined under the subsequent more conservative cabinets. In 1840, Chevalier authored a famous letter (to Molé)  vigorously protesting the plan of the Thiers government to militarily fortify the city of Paris.    Economics only came gradually to him.  Having started out as an expert on transportation, Chevalier moved on to study public works (1838) and private manufacturing (1841).  Although he had picked up snippets of economic theory here and there, his understanding was still inchoate.  But this was soon remedied. In 1841, Michel Chevalier succeeded Pelegrino Rossi to Say's old chair at the Collège de France, and had to delve into economics literature to compose his lectures.  His lecture notes were recorded by a student and compiled into the Cours d'économie politique (1842-44), and then revised for a second edition by Chevalier in 1855-56.  The lectures show Chevalier's rapid deepening mastery of the field over this time period, as well as his changing economic views.  At the beginning still a romantic Saint-simoniste, suspicious of laissez-faire, Chevalier was soon converted to a faithful adherent of the French Liberal School. and a fervent proponent of free trade principles.  In 1842, Chevalier helped found the Société d'Économie Politique and the influential Journal des économistes. In January, 1845, Chevalier was elected a deputy from Aveyron to the French parliament.  However, his brief political career soon came to an end.  Chevalier failed to be re-elected the next year, losing to a protectionist challenger, after a prolonged polemic over the benefits of free trade versus protectionism..  In between, Chevalier found time to get married to a certain Mlle Fournier, daughter of an industrialist in Herault. Chevalier greeted the February 1848 Revolution warily.  Chevalier authored a critique of the  budding labor schemes of  socialists Louis Blanc, Etienne Cabet and others - initially in the Revue de Deux Mondes in mid-March, and then (judging its readership too narrow) in a series of more popular letters in the Journal de Debats beginning in late March.  Chevalier's comments appalled his old Saint-Simonian comrades, notably Hippolyte Carnot, the new education minister.   His course at the  Collège de France was promptly suspended, and further steps were taken to suppress Chevalier's chair, ostensibly as part of a scheme of overall educational reform.  But it came to naught, and Chevalier's chair and course was soon restored by parliament. The matter was soon forgotten, and Chevalier found no obstacles to his election to the Académie des sciences morales et politiques in February 1851, succeeding Joseph Droz. Michel Chevalier welcomed the coup of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte in December 1851, and was promptly given a position in Bonaparte's Council of State in January, 1852.  Chevalier's collaboration shocked fellow liberal  economists, many of whom were republicans and suspicious of the populist conservative ""president prince"".  There were moments of tension with the firmly anti-Bonapartiste Horace Say at the Société d'Économie Politique.  But the appearance of Chevalier's Examen later in 1852, with its vigorous defense of free trade, set doubts at rest.   Indeed, Chevalier was to be vital in making liberal economic policy a  key feature of the Second Empire.  Too busy with his government functions, Chevalier delegated Henri Baudrillard to teach his economics course at the Collège de France through the 1850s and early 1860s (Chevalier only resumed his academic duties in 1866).  The embrace of Manchester-style ""liberalism"" during the Second Empire faced steep obstacles, and the chipping away at France's highly protective system came only in small steps, usually by temporary emergency decrees in the name of Napoleon III.  In June 1856, a comprehensive bill  devised by Chevalier to replace outright prohibitions on the import of manufactures with still-highly protective tariffs (30-50%), faced such tremendous opposition in the normally-compliant Chamber of Deputies that it had to be withdrawn.  By 1860, despite continuous efforts, the French protectionist system had barely been dented.  Chevalier decided to outmaneuver domestic opposition in parliament by using the emperor's prerogative to negotiate treaties.  The ascension of the Liberal government of Palmerston and Russell in Britain late 1859, both of whom had liberal economic views and prior good relations with Napoleon III,  offered a valuable opportunity, and in October 1859, Chevalier opened secret negotiations with Richard Cobden..   In the resulting ""Cobden-Chevalier"" Anglo-French commercial treaty, signed on January 23, 1860, France abolished all import prohibitions, replacing them with a tariff on imports of British coal and most British manufactures of 30% or less, while Britain reduced duties on the importation of French wines and brandy.  It also included a ""most-favoured-nation"" clause, then a novel concept, by which Britain and France agreed to grant each other the same privileges now or in the future, that they might grant to any other foreign country (this substituted the usual ""reciprocity clause"", which had been customary in trade treaties before 1860 - where the extension of a new privilege to an existing trade partner was not automatic but conditional on the old partner matching the concessions of the new one). The negotiation of the treaty was, in some senses, unorthodox and surprising.  The erratic French emperor was still viewed with suspicion in Britain, and only recently, over the Summer of 1859, there been a panic in the British press - provoked by Viscount Palmerston himself - that France was preparing to declare war and invade Britain.  The  Manchester School leaders, Richard Cobden and John Bright, had both urged trade treaties as a way to secure peace and overcome war fears with France.  Chevalier, who had been in contact with Cobden at least as far back as 1846, agreed and decided to act.  Under the guise of traveling to Bradford for an international conference on weights and measures, Chevalier zipped across the channel, and went through a quick series of meetings with Cobden, Bright, the French ambassador Flialin de Persigny, the chancellor of the exchequer William Gladstone and the suspicious prime minister Palmesrton himself.   Chevalier invited Cobden to accompany him back to France, to help persuade  and they stayed in Paris together With Palmerston's reluctant blessing, Cobden accompanied Chevalier back to France, and stayed with him in Paris through the fall of 1859, to help him persuade Napoleon III.  The emperor did need much persuading, having attended ACLL meetings while in exile in England back in 1846, and well-aware of the arguments.   But Cobden's mission, private and unofficial as it was, had an air of vitality and dulled opposition back in Britain, helping him (or more precisely, Gladstone, then chancellor of the exchequer) to sell the trade treaty as a way to ""avoid war"" rather than requiring him to prove it was good in itself.   The opposition of the French manufacturing interests was side-stepped by keeping them in the dark as long as possible.  However, on January 15, the Moniteur published a letter of Napoleon III (dated January 5), expressing the emperor's intention to issue a series of liberalizing decrees and sign commercial treaties, revealing the on-going negotiations of Cobden and Chevalier.   The French protectionists - notably, iron-manufacturers, ""the praetorian guard of monopoly"", as Cobden characterized them - howled in protest but as the treaty did not need to go through parliament, were powerless to stop it.  They duly denounced it a ""another coup d'etat"".  This was followed up by further more precise protocols on trade with Britain (signed on October 12 and November 16 later that year). Chevalier's 1860 treaty coup was hailed by the French Liberal School, and any misgivings about Chevalier's credentials or dubious past associations were promptly forgiven or forgotten.  He had accomplished in one blow what careful arguments by generations of Says and Bastiats had failed.  Chevalier did not rest on this one treaty, but went on to push France to pursue other similar commercial treaties -  with Belgium (May, 1861),  Prussia and thus the German Zollverein  (August, 1862), the fledgling kingdom of Italy (January, 1863), Switzerland (June, 1864), Sweden and Norway (February, 1865), the Hanseatic towns (March, 1865), Spain (June 1865), the Netherlands (July 1865), Portugal (July 1866) and finally Austria (December, 1866).  Most came with most-favored-nation clauses, thus ensuring their benefits would be passed around.  Other nations, like Denmark, were integrated into this commercial network by their prior treaties with England.  As country after country plugged into the Anglo-French treaties, the compounding of most-favoured-nation clauses ensured a mass demolition of protectionist barriers across continental Europe.  The treaty negotiated by Chevalier and Cobden in 1860 had, in six short years, made the free trade liberal era a reality, bringing centuries of Mercantilist economic warfare to an end. At least in Europe.  The United States and Russia stuck to their protectionist policies and remained stubbornly out of the Anglo-French network - although France would eventually manage to finally bring Russia into the complex a decade later (April, 1874).   Although sometimes given to utopian reflections on free trade, Chevalier believed in the importance of an interventionist government to check the excesses and dangers of free enterprise. Although his economic research was highly historical in nature, Chevalier was not averse to economic theory and was indeed a great admirer of the British proto-Marginalist economist Henry D. Macleod. Chevalier was succeeded in the political economy chair at Collège de France by his son-in-law Paul Leroy-Beaulieu      Major Works of Michel Chevalier """" 1847, Annales de Mines, p.257   Resources on Michel Chevalier   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

In 1859, Cheysson moved to Rheims, working was an engineer on a variety of projects, such as the Aisne-to-Marne canal, the Épernay waterworks and the Rheims-to-Châlons railway. He subsequently moved back to Paris, and was appointed to oversee the machinery at the Paris Exposition universelle of 1867. In 1868, Cheysson became a professor of adminstrative literature at his alma mater, the EPC. During the 1870-71 siege of Paris, Cheysson was put in charge of securing the distribution of flour in the city. After the war, Cheysson worked a series of jobs, e.g. factory manager in the industrial town of Creusot (1871-74), engineer at Seine navigation (1874-77), and director of maps and plans at the French Ministry of public works (1877-84)

In 1882, Cheysson was appointed professor of political and social economy at the École libre des sciences politiques and, from 1884, professor of industrial economy at the École des mines. Cheysson wrote wide-ranging works on economics, emphasizing randomness and location of industrial activity.  He was also a disciple of the engineer and Christian socialist, Frederic Le Play.

Sir Josiah Child, 1630-1699.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/child.htm," English Mercantiist, East India Company merchant and probably the wealthiest man in Great Britain at the time.  Descended from a prominent London merchant family, Sir Josiah Child built his principal fortune in victualling for Cromwell's navy in Portsmouth, accumulating a tiny fortune which he then, in the 1660s, invested into a London brewery and other enterprises to assist in the effort.  In 1668, Josiah Child published his first significant tract, Brief Observations, essentially addressing the ""Dutch threat"" and attempting to decipher the secret of their success.  He proceeds to itemize fifteen reasons for it - thriftiness, the absorption of talented immigrants, etc. - but the ""causa causans"", Child argues, was a low rate of interest.  He argued that England should also adopt measures to lower the rate of interest,  and promoted legal restrictions to maintain low interest rates to make financing of British trade easier (and thus more competitive with the cheap-financed Dutch).  It was Child's propositions on interest rates spurred John Locke into economics.   Child gradually translated his fortune into East India Company stock.  By 1673, Child became the single largest shareholder of the East India Company.  He also had large investments in the Royal Africa Company. In 1677, Child was made director of the EIC, and was subsequently elected governor of the company from 1681 to 1687.  Simultaneously, his brother, John Child, already in India, was made president of Surat and governor of Bombay in 1682. Following the expulsion of English traders from Bantam (Indonesia) by the Dutch in 1682, the Child brothers set the EIC on a more aggressive, armed course.  In 1686, the Child brothers launched a blockade Indian shipping with a view to force the Moghul Emperor Araungzeb to concede more favorable terms of trade the EIC (including the right to fortify their factories).  This was accompanied by a hare-brained scheme to establish by force a fortified EIC stronghold in Chittagong (Bengal), and harass the Ganges delta.  They greatly underestimated the reaction of the Moghul Emperor and the Nawab of Bengal, who easily swept up the EIC factories in Surat and the Coromandel coast.  By 1689, the EIC was forced to sue for peace, magnanimously granted by the Emperor on the condition of John Child's departure in 1690. In the meantime, Josiah Child encouraged the EIC to solidify the company's position in England and preserve its monopoly, then being assailed by Bullionists and rivals, by turning prominent government officials, including the royal family, into shareholders.  In 1681, he forwarded a plan to expand the capital base of the EIC with new shares, which he intended to distribute to the powerful, but the plan was promptly derailed by a group of shareholders led by deputy governor Thomas Papillon, who was peddling an alternative scheme to wind up the joint stock established in 1657 and start anew.  Child managed to oust Papillon and his clique from leadership prompting them to sell their stock, provoking a brief run on the company shares and forcing Child to spend much of his tenure focusing on restoring the EIC's position.  He secured the renewal of its charter in 1683, essentially purchased with soft loans to the royal family. During this time, Josiah Child published a couple more tracts, resurrecting some of his 1668 arguments.   Abandoning the old saw of a favorable balance of trade, and seeing the value of free trade, even if it led to an outflow of precious metal, thus setting him down as the progenitor of the ""liberal"" English Mercantilism.  However, Child promoted the maintenance of monopolies on colonial trade and vigorously defended EIC policy. He also promoted a large population, free immigration and the employment of the poor. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 did not bode well for Child, as he was too closely associated with the deposed Stuarts.  From the outside,  Papillon led the opposition to Child, who still wielded the dominant influence in the company, and set in motion the movement to repeal the EIC's monopoly and open the East Indies trade to competition.  Child fought back, having the EIC distribute nearly £90,000 in bribes to sympathetic politicians, in an effort to preserve the monopoly.  Child's efforts exploded in a scandal and parliamentary inquiry in 1693, that led to the eventual repeal of the EIC monopoly and establishment of a rival company in 1698.

John Chrysostom, 347-407,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/chrysostom.htm," Archbishop of Constantinople and one of the leading Church Fathers in the formative years of the late 4th.. John Chrysostom was a fiery and gifted preacher, and formidable disputator, commentator and moral reformer John, nicknamed Chrysostom (""Golden Mouth""), son of a rich army family, was trained in law and rhetoric at Antioch, under the tutelage of patriarch Meletius of Antioch.  In the aftermath, John retired to monastic life, but subsequently came out of solitude and was ordained deacon at Antioch in 381, and priest in 386. These were heady years for the fledgling Christian church in the Roman empire.  Although Christianity had been unbanned by Emperor Constantine back in 312 and a uniform creed of Christian doctrine had been hammered out at Council of Nicaea in 325, it was far from universally embraced. Later Roman Emperors, keen on asserting their power over the church, had sponsored heretical thinkers and bishops who propounded innovations and deviations from the Nicene creed, and even revivals of pagan religion, and drove the Nicene-adherent clergy underground..

After the death of (Eastern) Roman Emperor Valens, a partisan of Arian Christianity, in 378, Nicene (Catholic-Orthodox) Christian exiles began to stream back to Constantinople. John Chrysostom emerged at this time as the protégé of a group of orthodox theologians, known as the ""Cappadocian Fathers"", which included Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus, who used their gifts of disputation to challenge Greek pagan philosophers, proving that Christians can hold their own against Plato and Aristotle, and encouraging Arian and semi-Arian bishops and others to shift their allegiance back to Nicene Christianity. The Cappadocian fathers shined at the Synod of Antioch in 379, and cleared the way for the all-important Council of Constantinople in 381 (the ""Second Ecumenical Council""), which restored and finalized the ""Nicene Creed"", the theological formula of Catholic-Orthodox Christianity that had been first articulated at Nicaea in 325 (but had been discarded during the Arian ascendancy of the mid-4th C.)

John Chrysostom succeeded Nectarianus as Archbishop of Constantinople in 398.  But his rigorous moral stance proved discomforting to the powers that be (although his denunciations of the immorality of the city's clergy and ruling classes were immensely popular with the populace). Having offended the Eastern empress Eudoxia, and aroused the jealousy of Archbishop Theophilus of Alexandria (who feared Chrysostom might elevate the prominence of Constantinople above Alexandria), a conspiracy soon evolved to depose him. At the Synod of the Oak in 403, assembled by Emperor Arcadius, John Chrysostom was accused of being in league with the followers of Origen (a Christian theologian sympathetic to Greek paganism), and he was deposed and banished.

Tumults in Constantinople prompted a brief recall, but he was banished again when he renewed his diatribes against the empress. During his banishment, much of the population of Constantinople (and many bishops and priests outside of it) refused to recognize the successors in his seat, insisting on the restoration of John Chrysostom. The death of John Chrysostom in 407 was a relief to the imperial authorities.

John Chrysostom's main works are a massive collection of biblical commentaries (scriptural homilies).  His treatise on the priesthood and on divine nature are also well known.  . His Adversus Judeus is notorious for articulating the characterization of Jews as ""christ-killers"" and denouncing ""Judaizers"", Christians who congregate in synagogues and observe Jewish rituals (like circumcision) and holidays in order to imitate the earlier life of Christ.

Sir John H. Clapham, 1873-1946.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/clapham.htm," Cambridge economic historian. John H. Clapham was born in Manchester, the son of a prosperous jeweller and Methodist.  Clapham was educated at the Leys School, a Methodist academy in Cambridge. He enrolled at King's College, Cambridge in 1892, obtaining first class honors in the Historical Tripos in 1894 and receiving his B.A. in 1895.  Clapham's essay on the causes of the war of 1792 won a prize and led to his election as a Fellow of King's College in 1898. He earned his M.A. in 1899.  In pursuit of the Historical Tripos at Cambridge, John H. Clapham had studied history under Henry Acton and William Cunningham and economics under Alfred Marshall.  Of the three, Marshall had probably the greatest influence.  Originally intending to specialize in the French Revolution, it was at Marshall's urging that he turned from political to economic history. Eschewing the nationalist-tinged historicism of Cunningham, Clapham embraced the free trade/laissez faire flavor of Marshall's orthodox Neoclassicism.  Failing to find a history position, at Marshall's urging, Clapham took up a chair in economics at Yorkshire College in Leeds (now University of Leeds) in 1902.  It is here he began working on his Woollen and Worsted Industries and contributing economic chapters to Acton's Cambridge Modern History. It was also around this time that he came into contact with the historicist W.J. Ashley, then in neighboring Birmingham. In 1908, Clapham returned to Cambridge as dean of King's College, becoming history tutor in 1913. During the First World War, Clapham served on the Board of Trade.  He was president of Section F of the BAAS in 1920, and led its committee on the gold standard, producing its famous Monetary Policy report.  Although Clapham recommended an immediate return to the gold standard, his younger co-writer D.H. Robertson dissented. Despite his Marshallian credentials, Clapham grew increasingly critical of abstract economic theory. Clapham got entangled with Pigou in a dispute over the practical relevance of Marshall's theory (the ""empty boxes"" debate of 1922).  J.H. Clapham went on to become the first Professor of Economic History at Cambridge in 1928. Clapham's most famous work is probably his magisterial Economic History of Modern Britain, where Clapham set about revising the popular pessimistic image of the 19th C. Industrial Revolution (originally articulated by romanticists and socialists, and reiterated by contemporaries such as J.L. Hammond,  R.H. Tawney and G.D.H. Cole)   Replete with statistical data, Clapham noted that the Industrial Revolution was slower and local, rather than a rapid national event, that the British government was not ignorant and neglectful, but quite aware of it and undertook measures to mitigate its impact, and, contrary to romantic anti-industrial rhetoric, Clapham asserted that wages and standards of living for most of the English urban working class (save for hand-loom weavers) had risen significantly throughout the period.  Clapham's optimistic interpretation kicked off a debate among economic historians that would continue through the 1960s. Clapham was the spearhead behind the notable Cambridge Economic History of Europe series, that began to appear in 1941.  He also authored an official history of the Bank of England. He was succeeded in his Cambridge chair by M.M. Postan.      Major Works of John H. Clapham   Resources on John Clapham   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Colin G. Clark, 1905-1989,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/colinclark.htm," British statistician and economist, whose Herculean data collection efforts remain almost unparalleled to the modern day. Colin Clark was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, obtaning his B.A. in 1928 and his M.A. in 1931. After a period lecturing in various places and a stint as an advisor in the Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald (1930-31), Clark was appointed lecturer in statistics at Cambridge University in 1931. Inspired by Arthur L. Bowley, Colin Clark compiled the first set of modern national income accounts for the United Kingdom. He pursued collection on a world-wide scale and published, in 1939, his famous Conditions of Economic Growth - the first study to make quantitatively evident the gulf between European countries and the rest of the world. His later work concentrated on issues in development economics, notably in stressing the role of population growth - and understressing that of investment - in economic growth. Colin Clark moved to Australia in 1938, working as an economic advisor in various position for the Queensland government.  He returned to Britain in 1952, to take up the directorship of the Institute for Agricultural Economics at Oxford.  In 1969, Colin Cark returned to Australia, spending the remaining years at Monash University in Melbourne and subsequently Queensland in 1978..      Major Works of Colin G.

John Bates Clark, 1847-1938.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/clark.htm," American Neoclassical economist, professor of economics at Columbia and one of the leading figures of the Marginalist Revolution.   Born in Providence, Rhode Island, the son of John Clark and Martha Bates, John Bates Clark, with some interruptions, was educated at Brown University and then later Amherst College (where he was taken under the wing by the arch-conservative Amherst president Julius Seelye).  Clark obtained his B.A. at Amherst in 1872.   Like so many bright Americans of his generation, John Bates Clark proceeded to Germany, where he studied for three years under Karl Knies at the University of Heidelberg.  There Clark imbibed the spirit of the German Historical School, and he brought that back with him to the United States.   Clark formed part of the ""new generation"" of German-trained American economists -- which included R.T.  Ely, E.R.A. Seligman, S.N. Patten and others -- that confronted the more conservative American economists of the age.   Although Clark was never a doctrinaire practitioner of the ""historical"" approach, he gave it his due respect and embraced the Statist policies and ""Christian Socialism"" that went along with it.  After returning to the United States from his German training, Clark worked as a college teacher (in an assortment of different disciplines) at Carleton College (Thorstein Veblen was among his students there).  In 1881, through Seelye's good offices, Clark got an appointment at Smith College and, in 1893, followed Seelye to Amherst College.  Clark came into contact with graduate students via a lectureship at Johns Hopkins from 1892 (Thomas Nixon Carver came under his influence there).  In 1895, John Bates Clark joined the faculty of Columbia University in New York City, where he would remain for the rest of his career.  Under Clark, Columbia became the home of his ""Social Value"" school of marginalist economics.  John Bates Clark helped found the American Economic Association in 1885, serving as its first vice-president and went on to become its third president in 1894-95.  The AEA instituted the ""John Bates Clark medal"" in 1947, awarded every second year (annually since 2009) to the most promising young economist under forty years of age. Clark's first book,  The Philosophy of Wealth (1885), was an attempt to reform the American theory of property, bringing it closer in line with his Christian Socialist ethics.  He sees ""wealth"" not as a natural phenomenon but rather a political creation.  Without laws protecting private property, there would be no ""value"" to property and thus no ""wealth"".  Consequently, the foundations of a wealth are not in any God-given right due to the ""productive"" labor expended by the individual, but rather in the legal ""appropriability"" of property, which is a socio-political phenomenon.  Clark denounced economists for adhering to the idea of an ""economic man"" solely motivated by self-interest and for naively believing that ""competition"" was a panacea for any ill-effects selfish behavior might bring about. Clark emphasized the importance of eschewing ""methodological individualism"" and placing the individual in an ""organic"" context, as an integral part of a social body.    However, Clark shied away from political socialism, arguing that immediate schemes of redistribution would destroy private incentives entirely.  Furthermore, they would be unethical as effort would not be rewarded.  Foreshadowing his later theory of distribution, Clark argued that the ""ethical"" case in an ideal ""socialist"" society, is that everyone receives what he produces.    In his view, progress towards such a just society is ""natural"" -- in a Darwinian-Spencerian evolutionist sense.  He hailed the trade union movement in mixed terms.  On the one hand, he believed that they were merely demanding the workers' ""fair share"", which he argued had been appropriated by the illegal practices of business owners in the past.   On the other hand, he deplored the destructive consequences of this monopolistic business vs. monopolistic labor competition on society and its moral values.   Echoing his German education, Clark argued that the State needs to step in to arbitrate an end this destructive conflict, but this was only a second-best solution.  The first-best would be for all the participants themselves to undergo a ""spiritual"" awakening and ""realize"" that cooperation in wage-setting, rather than conflict, was the best avenue.   At times, he would get more enthusiastic about State interference.  If, through its laws, the State is the ""creator"" of wealth, consequently the State has the ethical right to say how it is allocated and distributed.  As he would write later, ""The State and no other may say into what form pure capital may go.  It has said that it may go into land.  For ends of its own it has so decided; and the ends are good."" (Clark, 1890).  However, the most stunning contribution made in his 1885 Philosophy was discovery of the marginal utility theory of value -- without knowing about the earlier contributions of Jevons, Menger and Walras!  John Bates Clark can thus justly be considered the ""fourth"" independent creator of the Marginalist Revolution.   Although this may seem at odds with his methodological attacks, we should note that Clark sought to ground his theory of value in his ""organic"" theory of society and even gave it an early ""characteristics"" form.  However, a one wit was to note later, ""To learn for yourself a new theory ten years or more after it has been widely published is to invite from the jury an indictment of negligence rather than an award for brilliance."" (Samuelson, 1967). Clark perceptively changed his tune after the capital-labor confrontations of the mid-1880s.  Repudiating his Christian Socialist past, Clark gradually embraced a decidedly Capitalist Apologist position.   The impetus for the change was partly the growing popularity of agrarian socialists like Henry George.  Drawing on older American theories of property based on labor, George attacked the ""unearned increment"" of rent on land as patently unjust and thus subject to expropriation.  But Clark's own theory of property rested on denying that ownership is ""legitimized"" only by productive labor.  To respond to George, Clark needed to show that the earnings on land are no different than the earnings on other factors of production.  Clark (1888) introduced the idea of an abstract capital fund, or ""social capital"", which ""transmigrates"" between different concrete forms, from specific capital goods to land.  In a sense, Clark seems to suggest that all factors are ""capital"" and earnings on capital, whatever form it is in, are all ""legitimate"".   It was no surprise, then, in the next step,  John Bates Clark, would be eager to show that the Ricardian rent principle applied to all scarce factors.  It had been well-known, at least since Francis A. Walker (1876) made it clear, that there was nothing quite ""special"" about land.  If you hold any factor constant (whether land or capital or labor or whatever), the other remaining factors will exhibit diminishing marginal productivity and thus ""rents"".  Clark's great contribution in 1889-91 however, was to show that if all factors were paid their marginal products, the sum of factor income would exhaust the total output.  This ""product-exhaustion"" theorem is better known as the ""Marginal Productivity Theory of Distribution.""  Although independently discovered by Philip H. Wicksteed (1894) Knut Wicksell (1893) and others soon after, John Bates Clark's main claim to fame rests on having been the first to propose and demonstrate it.  In his later 1899 Distribution of Wealth, Clark extrapolated enormous ethical conclusions from the marginal productivity theory. . Clark was Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk's great opponent in an early ""capital controversy"", pitting the Austrian theory of capital against Clark's own theory, where he proposed that there was a ""permanent"" fund of capital which entered into a production function like any other factor.  This theory was given firmer grounding in his later 1907 Essentials, where he developed his dynamic ""coordination"" story further.  Clark's ""parable"" was taken up in the 1930s by Frank Knight in yet another capital controversy with the Austrian School.  It was incorporated into Neoclassical growth theory in the 1950s,  it generated yet another battle, the Cambridge Capital Controversy.  As one of few American economists of the Marginalist school and a prominent apologist for the capitalist system, John Bates Clark was skewered by the rising the Institutionalist School -- he became one of Thorstein Veblen's favorite targets.  Ironically, John Bates Clark's son, John Maurice Clark, would go on to become a leading Institutionalist.      Major works of John Bates Clark   Resources on J.B.

Thomas E. Cliffe Leslie, 1825-1882.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/cliffe.htm," Irish legal scholar and historicist economist  Thomas E. Cliffe Leslie was born County Wexford, Ireland, to a family of Scottish descent.  Schooled initially by his father, he was sent away to complete his grammar school education in England.  He was educated at King's William College on the Isle of Man and enrolled at Trinity College Dublin in 1842, making a mark as a classical scholar, and graduating in 1847, with prizes in ethics and logic (fellow Trinity student J.E. Cairnes would earn the same prizes a year later).  Leslie started a career as a lawyer, joining the Irish bar in 1850 and earning an LL.B. in 1851. After further studies at Lincoln's Inn in London, Leslie was called to the English bar in 1857.  However, he always took better to academia than the law office, and in 1853 was appointed Professor of Jurisprudence and Political Economy at Queen's University Belfast, a post he would hold until his death. Cliffe Leslie nurtured from the start an interest in economics - especially applied economics.  He was an active member of Dublin Statistical Society, giving Barrington lectures on political economy to the general public in Irish towns in 1852-53.  Nonetheless, London remained his primary residence, and Cliffe-Leslie contributed steadily to primarily English magazines and reviews.  Cliffe Leslie demonstrated a historicist bent, derived partly from his own applied work, and partly indirectly from the continental German school (although Auguste Comte was probably a more significant influence).  Cliffe Leslie particularly credits lectures given in the 1850s by the English legal sociologist Henry Maine for influencing him, and inducing him to discard abstract natural law theories and seeing the law as an outcome of its historical context.  Leslie laid down his historicist gauntlet in his review of Adam Smith for the Fortnightly Review in 1870.  He lauds Smith for being a proper inductive economist, constructing his economic theory from a thorough familiarity with the history and facts, and derides David Ricardo and the later Classical school for abandoning that track and replacing facts with abstractions, induction with deduction, real behavior with psychological ideals, etc.  He elaborates further in his 1876 critique of Cairnes and elsewhere, famously expounding: ""the abstract and á priori method yields no explanation of the laws determining either the nature, the amount, or the distribution of wealth; ...the philosophical method must be historical, and must trace the connexion between the economical and the other phases of national history"" (Cliffe Leslie, 1876: p.295) Cliffe Leslie's dissatisfaction with Classical economics was already evident in his early economics-related work - most notably on land systems.  The Irish Great Famine showed the failure of Classical theory to help understanding the real world, that trying to fit the Irish situation into a pre-existing theoretical model,  only yielded wrong conclusions and poor solutions.  Rather than demand the extension of English capitalist agriculture, Cliffe Leslie recommended land reform towards small proprietors as the solution to Ireland's problems.  (Politically, Cliffe Leslie was an opponent of Home Rule).  Cliffe Leslie applied his empirical approach to various other economic questions.  He wrote extensively on the statistical relationship between the supply of gold and the price level in the 1870s.  In an earlier essay (1863), Leslie expounded an anti-Malthusian demographic transition. Thomas E. Cliffe Leslie became one of the leading figures, if not the founder, of the English Historical School and a prominent (and virulent) critic of  Classical Ricardian theory.  One of Cliffe Leslie's criticisms was that it had sidelined consumer behavior and demand. He developed the idea of ""consumer sovereignty"", but insisted that the analysis of demand should be couched in historical and institutional terms. His heavy-handed criticism of the deductive methods of the Ricardians made an impression, and was very influential on later English historicists like William J. Ashley and William Cunningham.

Robert Clower, 1926-2011,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/clower.htm," American economist, one of the founders of Disequilibrium Keynesianism in the late 1960s. Born in Pullman, Washington.  He served in the US Army during World War II (he landed at Omaha beach the day after the D-Day).  After the war, Clower attended Washington State University, earning his B.A. and M.A.  Selected as a Rhodes Scholar, Clower went on to complete his studies at Brasenose College, Oxford University, studying under John Hicks. Clower returned to the United States in 1952.  After a stint at WSU, Clower went on to become professor at Northwestern University in 1958.  While at Northwestern, Clower came in contact with Axel Leijonhufvud, a student at the time (but apparently, Clower was not his mentor).  In 1971, Clower moved to UCLA (again, with Leijonhufvud) before settling down at the University of South Carolina in 1986.  Robert Clower's early work on stocks and flows indicated that something was indeed amiss in the orthodox ""Neoclassical-Keynesian Synthesis"". In 1965, Clower produced his famous article ""The Keynesian Counterrevolution"" which underlined the inconsistent manner in which Neoclassical economics and Keynesian theory had been synthesised. He highlighted the absence of a microeconomically-founded Keynesian theory. Among the several resolutions he proposed was a reconstruction of microeconomics to account for the constraints imposed by effective demand - the ""Dual Decision Hypothesis"". The famous ""Clower Constraint"" (or ""Cash-In-Advance Constraint"") was introduced by Clower in 1967 as an expression of the effective demand constraint. The outcome of Clower's theory was a ""disequilibrium"" approach to a Walras-Keynes synthesis. The work of Axel Leijonhufvud and the early work of Robert Barro employed Clower's approach. The European ""Non-Walrasian"" school of macroeconomics also formalized and extended several of Clower's propositions.      Major works of Robert W.

Ronald H. Coase, 1910-2013,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/coase.htm," LSE-trained member of the Chicago School, and father of the New Institutional school. Ronald H. Coase is best known for two particular contributions to economic theory - his theory of the firm (1937), and his theory of social cost (1960). Coase 1937 article addressed the problem of why firms exist.  Conventional Neoclassical production theory conceives of a firm as little more than an technical instrument connecting factor inputs to output of goods.  If so, Coase asked, then why is not production organized in a decentralized manner, e.g. capitalists hiring daily labor, depending on what needs to be produced?   Instead, we have a firm, a permanent organized entity, managed internally by command rather than contract.  Coase argued that firms should be conceived as entities endogenous to the economic system and whose existence is justified only in the presence of transactions costs to production. Firms, and other economic organizations and institutions, exist because agents find it a useful manner of minimizing transactions costs. His second major contribution was his famous ""Coase Theorem"" (1960) on social costs.  Previously, it had been longstanding, since Pigou (1912), that externalities could produce a ""market failure"", and only an entity like a government, by means of taxes and subsidies, could ""internalize"" externalities in economic exchange or production.  But Coase argued that, when one considers opportunity cost in its full meaning, no such devices are necessary: private losers and winners in such cases can ""internalize"" these externalities themselves through private negotiation between themselves.  Moreover, Coase noted, the result will be identical regardless of which party has rights of ownership over the cause of the externality. In short, the manner in which a property right is initially assigned will not affect the efficiency of resource allocation.  As a result there shouldn't be market failures. Coase argues the only reason we observe market failures is when property rights are ill-defined or there are transactions costs to negotiation, in which case social costs fail to be internalized.  The Coase Theorem opens the range of corrective possibilities beyond Pigouvian taxes for social welfare policy, but policies that clarify or assign property right or reduce transaction costs could be pursued instead. These two theorems have found wide application throughout economics - and also law, sociology and political science (particularly of the Chicago variety) and launching the whole field of ""New Institutional Economics"" - thereby making Ronald Coase one of the leading ""imperialists"" on behalf of economics into other disciplines. It was on the strength of these theorems that R.H. Coase won the Nobel prize in 1991.      Major works of Ronald H. Coase   Resources on Ronald Coase   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
William Cobbett, 1763-1835,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/cobbett.htm,"English free-lance journalist,  pamphleteer, historian and political reformer. The son of a small farmer and innkeeper in Farnham, Surrey. Of humble background, William Cobbett had few prospects in his youth. By chance, Cobbett found work as a copy clerk in London in early 1783, but abandoned it a few months later to enlist in the British army.  Cobbett availed himself during lulls in his garrison at Clapham to educate himself and began to delve deeply into English literature.  Rising in the ranks to NCO, Cobbett was stationed for eight years in Nova Scotia, Canada.  Cobbett's regiment returned to England in 1791, and the very next year, after earning his discharge, Cobbett published the Soldier's Friend (1792) a damning indictment of army's inner workings, the corruption of officers and mistreatment of enlisted soldiers.  To avoid trouble, Cobbett moved to France in 1792, and witnessed the violent shift in the fledgling revolution. The onset of war and the September massacres prompted his departure for the United States later that same year.  For the next few years, Cobbett made a slim living as a tutor and translator in Philadelphia.    An anonymous 1794 pamphlet on the emigration of Joseph Priestley brought him some degree of celebrity.  Cobbett set up a bookstore and monthly, The Censor in Philadelphia in 1796, but it folded after a few numbers.  In March 1797, Cobbett set up a daily, the Porcupine Gazette, where he authored  (under the pseudonym ""Peter Porcupine"") and reprinted virulent articles defending the British war against the French Republic.  He also saw fit to comment on the American politics, aligning himself with the federalists.  His outspoken politics and scurrilous articles quickly earned him some local enemies.  After losing a couple of lawsuits for libel in Pennsylvania courts, Cobbett moved to the more solidly federalist New York and launched a new monthly, The Rush-light. William Cobbett returned to England in 1800, and was given a warm welcome by Tories who had been following his tracts from overseas. With financial support from Tory luminaries, Cobbett published a collected edition of his American writings and launched a daily, The Porcupine, but it folded after a year.  He also opened a bookstore in London, which also did not last very long. In January 1802,Cobbett launched the Political Register, a long-lasting weekly newsletter that he edited almost continuously from 1802 to 1835.  In 1803, William Cobbet began publishing his most enduring work, his monumental Parliamentary History of England, compiling detailed accounts of the proceedings of the English parliament from its beginnings in 1066 onwards.  Cobbett's work has become the authoritative record of parliamentary history (taken over by T.C. Hansard after 1811, and continued until the modern day).  His similarly impressive history of State Trials began being published in 1809. Although Tory by inclination, Cobbett nonetheless soon soured and denounced many of the policies pursued by the Tory governments that ruled Britain through much of this period.  Cobbett soon became more identified with the Radicals.  He ran for parliament (but lost) in 1806 on a radical parliamentary reform ticket. In economics, William Cobbett's principal claim to fame is his participation in the 1807-08 debate on underconsumption.   In late 1807, he reviewed the recent treatise of William Spence and endorsed its conclusions in a series of articles entitled ""Perish Commerce!"" published in his Political Register.    Among other schemes he promoted were the repudiation of the national debt and the abolition of most taxation. In 1810, Cobbett was arrested and convicted for libel, and spent two years in Newgate Prison.  It is during this period that he wrote his pamphlets against money, calling for the resumption of gold currency and the dissolution of the Bank of England.  After his release, although financially ruined, Cobbett continued publishing, using the Political Register to rally opposition to the 1815 Corn Laws and denouncing the slavery abolition movement.  In 1817, fearing renewed arrest for libel, Cobbett fled to the United States (Yorkshire printer Thomas Wooler took charge of publishing Cobbett's Political Register in his absence).  Cobbett tried setting himself up as a farmer in Long Island, New York, and published a few works on agriculture, but found it bored him, and returned to England in 1819.  At the time, England was caught in a depression, and the cause of parliamentary reform had caught fire. Cobbett jumped into the thick of it, and ran twice (1821 and 1826)  unsuccessfully for a seat as a Radical.  He also took up the cudgels for Catholic Emancipation, writing a vitriolic history of the abuses of the Reformation.  Between 1822 and 1826, Cobbett launched a series of articles in the Political Register known as the ""Rural Rides"" (published as a book in 1830), giving a personal account of his rides into the English countryside, surveying and  and collecting stories of the agricultural distress.  In 1829, he published his Advice to Young Men, condemning Malthus's population theory.  Cobbett's agitation culminated in the Rural War, where he condoned the violent Luddite Swing Riots that had rocked the English countryside in 1830.  This earned him another arrest for seditious libel in 1831, but he defended himself and was acquitted. After the Parliamentary reform bill finally passed in 1832, Cobbett finally won a parliamentary seat (for Oldham) and was a leading agitator for Poor Law reform (which passed in 1834).  Cobbett died a year later, in June 1835. It is commonly said that William Cobbett anticipated the Tory ""Young England"" movement of Disraeli and companions, that would emerge in the decade after his death  However, Cobbett was too unsystematic to be said to be the founder of any school of thought, and his reputation as a passionate and pugnatious opinion-stirrer occasionally harmed some of the very causes he took up..

Richard Cobden, 1804-1865.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/cobden.htm,"British businessman, politician, pamphleteer and ardent free trade activist, founder of the ""Manchester School"" of classical liberalism.. Richard Cobden broke into print with a pair of anonymous pamphlets in 1836 denouncing popular calls for British military intervention to defend Turkey against Russian encroachments.  Cobden urged British government to pay more attention to international problems closer to home, notably the distress in Ireland and the rise of the United States.  Cobden pointed out that Russia was not a threat to British interests, that Russia would likely have no more success in amalgamating Turkish lands than the British had in amalgamating neighboring Ireland (and even if she succeeded, it might not be such a bad thing), and that fears of Russia acquiring a warm-water port in Constantinople should be no more worrisome to Britain than the United States having a warm-water port in New York.   While written as a plea for peace in this specific instance, Cobden's tracts expressed wider points about foreign policy in general.  He derided nationalism, territorial aggrandizement and ""balance of power"" reasoning as pointless and dangerous relics of Mercantilist folly.  Indeed, Cobden eschewed all foreign policy whatsoever, confident that peace and prosperity would be better secured and maintained by trade and interaction between the private citizens of different countries than high-level diplomacy between governments.  He believed this to be the secret of American success, and distilled it into a maxim:  ""As little intercourse as possible between the governments; as much connection as possible between the nations of the world"" (p.33). Richard Codben, together with John Bright, was the founder of the Manchester-based Anti-Corn Law League in 1838, which was largely responsible for the repeal of the Corn Laws by Peel in 1846. Cobden was first elected to parliament in August 1841 as an MP for Stockport.  After 1846, Cobden concentrated on a campaign against British imperialism. Cobden was also responsible, with Michel Chevalier, for the 1860 ""Cobden-Chevalier"" trade treaty with France. As Bright would write in his diary, ""Lords and diplomatists, spending £15,000 a year, have been in Paris for half a century past, and done nothing: Cobden, a simple citizen, unpaid, unofficial, but earnest and disinterested, has done all."" (Jan 25, 1860) Cobden was instrumental in the creation of Owens College in Manchester, and lent his former home on Quay Street to house the fledgling college.  After his death, Owens College created the Cobden Lectureship in his name.      Major Works of Richard Cobden     Resources on Richard Cobden   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Gustav Cohn, 1840-1919.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/cohn.htm,"German Historical School economist at Göttingen.

Gustav Cohn originated from Marienwerder, West Prussia. He studied at the universities of Berlin and Jena. After a period at the Prussian statistical bureau in Berlin, Cohn became a private lecturer (privat-docent) at the University of Heidelberg in 1869, but almost immediately moved to a polytechnical school of Riga (then in Russian Latvia).  After a period in England, Gustav Cohn produced his 1874-75 study of English railway policy.  In 1876, Cohn moved to a polytechnical school in Zurich (Switzerland).

Gustav Cohn returned to Germany in 1884, taking up the position of professor at the University of Göttingen. Cohn's System der Nationalökonomie (1885, followed up by two further volumes in 1885 and 1889) is widely regarded as his masterpiece.  Gustav Cohn cemented his reputation as a leading member of the Younger German Historical School, doctrinally associated with Adolph Wagner in Berlin.  Keenly interested  in social reform, Cohn was dismissive of the positive-normative distinction and emphatic at viewing economics as an ethical science.  In his own work, Cohn was a specialist in railway policy and public finance and a historian of early economic thought   Gustav Cohn educated many of the ""new generation"" of American expatriate students that attended Göttingen, and was influential on the American Institutionalist school  (Veblen translated one of his works).

Roger Coke, ?-1704?,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/coke.htm,"English Mercantilist writer. Roger Coke was born after 1626, the grandson of the great English common law jurist, Sir Edward Coke. Roger Coke was educated at Queen's College, Cambridge, but did not take a degree.  Although demonstrating an early aptitude for mathematics, Coke's earliest writings were in political philosophy, notably a treatise against Hobbes (1660). Coke turned to trade in the early 1670s. Basing himself on Fortrey's calculations, Roger Coke believed that Restoration England had declined in population and trade relative to foreign powers over the past few decades. Although a Mercantilist in his theoretical framework, Roger Coke nonetheless opposed most of the typical government regulations, restrictions of trade and monopolies. Coke traced the rise of Dutch prosperity, linking it to the advantages of liberalizing trade and recommended similar course of action for Britain.  Outside of economics, Coke is best remembered for his Detection (1694), a gossipy account of the history of the English royal court.  Little else is known about his life.  According to the preface of its 1719 ed (p.xiii), Roger Coke was not very successful in business, suffering several reverses, and ended up dependant on a £100 annuity granted by his nephew.  He was apparently jailed for a while for debt at Fleet Prison and died a bachelor, at the age of 75.      Major Works of Roger Coke   Resources on Roger Coke   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Jean Baptiste Colbert, 1619-1683.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/colbert.htm,"  Powerful contrôleur général  (roughly, minister of finance) under King Louis XIV of France from 1661 to 1683.  Colbert managed, against the incredible odds of the Sun King's extravagance, to keep some degree of solvency in French state finances.  He is the architect of the French strain of Mercantilism, known as Colbertisme.  Jean-Baptiste Colbert was a commoner, born to a  merchant family in Reims, in the Champagne region of France . After some reverses to his father's business, the family moved to Paris in 1629, in the hopes of starting a new career in finance, leaving young Colbert behind in a Jesuit boarding school in Reims.  In 1634, at the age of fifteen, Colbert was sent to Lyons to apprentice in a commercial banking house. He eventually returned to Paris to rejoin his family, and was placed by his father as an intern in various offices around Paris (notary, procurator) to complete his training.  In 1640, reaching the age of twenty one,  his father (with the help of his influential cousin, Colbert de Saint-Pouange) managed to purchase a State office for young Colbert in the administration of Cardinal Richelieu.  Colbert thus moved from the private sector to the public sector.  His position, as commissaire ordinaire des guerres, had Colbert traveling around France, visiting garrisons to inspect their supplies and equipment.  He acquired a reputation as a diligent, meticulous and exacting bureaucrat.  Colbert had a knack for the public service, and hero-worshipped Richelieu.  Richelieu death in 1642 was followed a few months later by the death of his master, Louis XIII.  The new king, Louis XIV, was merely five years old, and a regency council was formed under the queen-mother Anne of Austria and Richelieu's protegé, Cardinal Jules Mazarin, the new prime minister of France.  Mazarin promptly appointed Michel Le Tellier as the secretary of state for war in 1643.  Le Tellier was the brother-in-law of the aforementioned Colbert de Saint Pouange, and the family connection improved young Colbert's prospects, and he soon became Le Tellier's personal commissioner.  Political fortune was soon joined by material fortune: in 1647, one of Colbert's uncles was charged with treason, and Le Tellier arranged for the confiscation and transfer of his property to the young Colbert. In 1648, Colbert married Marie Charron, a rich heiress.  As a wedding gift, La Tellier secured him the honorific title of ""Councillor of State"", enshrining Colbert's position as a high official.  Between 1648 and 1652, France was convulsed in ""La Fronde"", a complicated, multi-stage civil war. Colbert remained loyally by Le Tellier's side. He soon found himself shuttling with frequency as a messenger between the frontline, where Le Tellier was organizing the royal troops, and the fugitive royal court, moving around in the provinces. As a result, Colbert soon became a familiar face to the young king, his mother and the cardinal.  Colbert and Mazarin did not get along initially - Colbert felt the Italian-born Mazarin was an inadequate successor to the great Richelieu, and his nationalist feathers were ruffled by Mazarin's entourage of Italian advisors; for his part, Mazarin protested to Le Tellier about Colbert's ill-concealed contempt and manners.  Nonetheless, Colbert's professionalism, diligence and discretion in handling high States secrets gradually inspired the trust of Mazarin in the young commissioner.  As the wars of the Fronde advanced, and Mazarin found his other officials abandoning or betraying him, Mazarin relied increasingly on Colbert to handle sensitive communications, and soon regarded him as the sole trustworthy man left in France. In June 1651, Colbert made the fateful decision of detaching from Le Tellier's service and entering the service of Cardinal Mazarin. At that moment, Mazarin was at the bottom of his fortunes, deprived of his formal powers and confined to internal exile in Saint-Germain. It seemed like an end to a political career, but Mazarin offered to make Colbert the manager of his private affairs and interlocutor between the exiled cardinal and the current official government.   The gamble paid off.  The Fronde dissolved by late 1652, and in February 1653, Mazarin returned to Paris, his powers as prime minister restored. Colbert came with him.  For the next eight years, Colbert served as intendant of Mazarin's household.  Officially, that meant Colbert was in charge of the cardinal's private affairs, while the cardinal focused on public affairs, but the distinction between the two areas was never strict nor clear. Cardinal Mazarin, in conjunction with the queen mother Anne of Austria, had led the regency council for the young King Louis XIV, who had ascended to throne at the tender age of five in 1643.  Although Louis was officially declared of age to rule in 1651, Mazarin had kept him out of power, and kept the regency council going.  Cardinal Mazarin died in 1661, and recommended his protegé Colbert as his replacement.  But King Louis XIV, now in his early twenties, decided enough was enough, and that he would be his own prime minister.  The king, however, did recognize Colbert's abilities, and held on to him. Colbert's profile fit Louis XIV's preference for ambitious commoners, instead of aristocrats, in his governing council. It was Colbert who arranged the intrigue that led to the fall and arrest of Nicolas Fouquet, the French superintendant of finances, in the summer of 1661.  In his place, Louis XIV appointed Colbert as contrôleur-général des finances (French minister of finance). Jean-Baptiste Colbert presided over the economic policy of France under Louis XIV from 1661 to his death in 1683.  Colbert believed in the Mercantilist doctrine that the expansion of commerce (and the maintenance of a favorable balance of trade) was the key to State wealth.  His policies -- what became known as Colbertisme -- were all geared in this direction.  Colbert doted on his charter companies, set up chambers of commerce, redirected capital to export and import-substitution industries, set up a protective system of tariffs and duties, blocked foreigners from trading in French colonies, etc.   By and large, Colbert was not interested in internal commerce which, in his view, did nothing for State wealth.  French farmers and small manufacturers were left locked in the stifling embrace of Medieval town crafts and merchant guilds.  Restrictions and internal tariffs on the movement of goods and labor between regions remained in place.  France's incredibly regressive tax system was reinforced.  With the privileged landowning gentry and clergy exempt from taxation and Colbert's new big merchant capitalists coddled with subsidies, the burden of taxes fell even heavier upon the luckless French farmers and small town craftsmen.  Colbert's encouragement of export industries, notably wine, transformed land-use patterns, leaving some areas of France dangerously close to food-insufficiency. Like the Duke of Sully before him, Colbert recognized the need for a good internal transportation network, but only because it was necessary to connect the ports to French export industries. Colbert revived the hated corvée, the unpaid labor-time owed by peasants to their feudal lords (and now the State) and forced local farmers and their draught-animals to work on road maintenance.  The Colbertiste system created a paradox.  It generated a ""progressive"" external economy while allowing the internal economy to stagnate.  Indeed, by the very set-up of the system, the promotion of the former often meant greater burdens for the latter.  Later commentators like the Maréchal de Vauban, Claude Jacques Herbert, Pierre le Pesant de Boisguilbert and Vincent de Gournay raised their voices and called for the reform of the fiscal and commercial system set up by Colbert.   When Colbert died in 1683, his steady restraining hand on the king was released.  King Louis XIV launched a series of expensively, ruinous wars for the next three decades.  By the time Louis XIV died in 1715, the French state was bankrupt, reviving a nostalgia for Colbert.  After the failed experiment of John Law to rescue French finances, Cardinal Fleury and Philibert Orry reinstituted Colbert's policies in the late 1720s and presided over a high period of Neo-Colbertisme in French state policy. Attention to the internal state of France accompanied the wave of liberalism in the the Enlightenment period of the late 18th Century.  Neo-Colbertistes such as Jacques Necker (who composed an Eloge to Colbert in 1773), Forbonnais and Graslin maintained that Colbert's policies were, on the whole, correct.  All that was required, they argued, was to bring the internal economy into shape by getting rid of some of the crippling Medieval restrictions, rationalizing administration and making the fiscal burden more equitable.  But French liberals, notably Quesnay and the Physiocratic clique, believed that Colbert's ideas was entirely wrong-headed and called unequivocally for their complete abandonment.  Much of the Colbertiste system was (temporarily) dismantled during Jacques Turgot's brief tenure as controller-general in the 1770s.  At the end of the day, the reforms were too little and too late. The tensions created by the Colbertiste paradox -- and the inability (or unwillingness) of Colbert's successors to fix it -- were one of the underlying causes, if not the primary cause, of the French Revolution of 1789.  Jean-Baptiste Colbert is sometimes given the sobriquet ""the Great Colbert"" (Le Grand Colbert) to distinguish him from his nephew and namesake, the Marquis de Torcy.

G.D.H. Cole, 1890-1959.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/cole.htm," English writer, political activist, and theorist of ""guild socialism"". G.D.H. Cole Studied at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was recruited by the Webbs and became an active member of the Fabian Society. However, Cole became gradually disenchanted with their program.  Feeling that their ""state socialist"" tactics ignored legitimate working class concerns, Cole split from the Fabians and forged the notion of ""Guild Socialism"" as a compromise between parliamentary activism (the Fabian route) and workers' desire to take control of industry (as advanced by syndicalists and radical unions).  Guild Socialism envisaged an economy reorganized on the basis of state-chartered but nonetheless self-governing producer organizations of workers -- ""guilds"".  In a sense, Cole was advocating a program of nationalization, but rather than having the industries guided by State bureaucracies, the organization of industry was to be handled by ""National Guilds"".    Guild socialism was at its height in the aftermath of the First World War, when it was regarded as the only avenue to the socialization of means of production which avoided the pitfalls of a Soviet-style totalitarian state and the anarchism of French syndicalism.  R.H. Tawney was particularly impressed by it.      Major Works of G.D.H. Cole   Resources on G.D.H. Cole   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Clara E. Collet, 1860-1948.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/collet.htm,"English economist, social science researcher and civil servant. Clara Elizabeth Collet was the daughter of the Charles Dobson Collet, a London merchant, journalist, Unitarian and radical activist.  Karl Marx contributed to Collet's review, The Diplomatic Review. Their families became friendly, and their two daughters, Clara Collet and Eleanor Marx became particularly close at a young age. Her father endeavored to give her the best education available at the time, enrolling Clara in the North London Collegiate School.  In 1878, she became a teacher at Wyggeston Girls' School in Leicester, while continuing her studies.  Collet enrolled at University College London and obtained her BA in October 1880, becoming one of the first women university graduates in England (women were only allowed to take degrees at UCL in 1878, the first English university to do so).  She continued to study economics, receiving a Teacher's Diploma along the way and obtaining her MA from UCL in 1887.  She won the Joseph Hume scholarship in Political Economy along with Henry Higgs in 1886.    Collet was recruited by Charles Booth as one of the researchers for his massive statistical project on the London poor. Booth was then in need of a researcher to complete the  study of women's work in the East End begun by Alice Stopford Green, who had abandoned the project in 1888.   Booth had originally asked on of his current researchers Beatrice Potter to undertake the additional study, but she was already overworked in other areas, so Collet was recommended instead (Potter had been introduced to Collet by their common friend Eleanor Marx).  To undertake the project, Collet left teaching in Leicester and took up residence in the East End slums of London in late 1888 (at the height of the ""Jack the Ripper"" murders in Whitechapel) and remained with the project until 1892.  While undertaking investigations, she also conducted occasional lectures nearby at Toynbee Hall, filling in for Henry Higgs' course on political economy when needed.  Growing in experience as an expert on female labor, Collet undertook some work as an assistant commissioner to the Royal Commission on Labour in 1892, and the next year, in 1893, Clara Collet joined the civil service as a Labour Correspondent for the Board of Trade.

Gerhard Colm, 1897-1968.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/colm.htm,"German public finance economist associated with the Kiel School and later, with the New School for Social Research.    His (then novel) approach  was to assess taxation policies not in terms of revenue generation, but rather in terms of their consequences on the economy.  His arguments influenced and paralleled the ""functional finance"" approach of Abba Lerner and the Neo-Keynesians in the post-war period.  Like them, Colm recommended the design of fiscal policies with macroeconomic objectives, in particular setting up automatic stabilizers to smooth out the cycle, and argued against fears of deficit spending,  arguing that ""a balanced economy is more important than a balanced budget"" .  He differed from the Keynesians, however, in to his insistence that the government set out a ""long-term"" strategy that included growth objectives, rather than short-term pump-priming. Colm became an important advisor to the U.S. Government.  He is largely responsible for the ""emergency budget"" provisions which permits expenditures that will pay for themselves and the setting up and reporting of regular  government forecasts and projections and the use of Kuznets's national income statistics.  Colm had a a large role in the Employment Act of 1946, was appointed to the first Council of Economic Advisors in the United States. Colm was also one of the organizers of the German currency reform of 1948.  He was basically pushed out of official position in 1952 during the McCarthyite hysteria, and thereafter worked at the National Planning Association.

Auguste Comte, 1798-1857,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/comte.htm," French mathematician, philosopher and social scientist, often regarded as the founding father of sociology and ""positivism"" Born in Montpellier (southern France) to a conservative family of crypto-royalists in the waning years of the first republic.  In 1814, Auguste Comte enrolled at the prestigious École Polytechnique in Paris, but left when the Ecole was shut down by the Bourbon authorities in 1816.  Comte remained in Paris, eking out a living as a mathematics tutor and occasional journalist.  Shortly after, Comte met Henri de Saint-Simon, and soon became his secretary and disciple.  After a close collaboration for several years, Comte finally broke with Saint-Simon in 1824 in a quarrel over publication rights.  He returned to the margins of Parisian intelligentsia, again making a living as a private tutor and minor journalist.  It was during this time that he developed the more definitive aspects of his ""positive philosophy"", professing to systematically organize and summarize all of natural and social sciences around a single empiricist principle. In August 1826, August Comte launched a public lecture series on his ""positivist philosophy"". Not having a scholastic chair, it was privately organized and held for the public who paid a subscription in advance.  Comte's name as a journalist was not unknown, and several Parisian notables (such as the economist Charles Dunoyer) enrolled out of curiosity.  The course went poorly - Comte had a mental breakdown after the third lecture and was unable to continue.  After a period in a sanatorium, Comte retired to his family in Montpellier for about a year. In 1829, Comte returned to Paris and resumed the lecture series.  It went only a little better than the first.  Although he attracted a small but loyal audience, his pretensions were mocked by professional academics and wider interest seemed to fall away.  Comte began writing his Cours in 1830, a task which would take over a decade to complete.  In the meantime, he continued to make do with erratic sources of income - e.g. as an occasional schoolteacher, an assistant lecturer and examiner at the Ecole, etc.  But his books soon gathered admirers - notably John Stuart Mill, who reviewed and lauded Comte as a first-rate thinker, and helped popularize his work.  Harriet Martineau translated it into English, opening a new and admiring audience. In 1843, with the Cours complete, Comte was finally seeming to obtain some of the recognition he craved, but things quickly turned erratic again.  Dismissed from his minor posts at the Ecole Polytechnique, Comte went on a journalistic rampage against the academic establishment. Then, in a stranger turn, Comte (who had recently been abandoned by his wife) fell in love with a certain Clothilde de Vaux.  It was not reciprocated and she died of consumption a couple of years later. Comte was heartbroken, but the experience seemed to have transformed Comte from a cold rationalist to a bubbling romantic.  In the 1850s, he began putting out his Système.  It had started out a systematic summary of his positivist philosophy, but under his new mindset, elevated emotion above rationality, and articulated a strange project for founding a new religion, a ""Religion of Humanity"", founded on universal love.  Comte's emotional and mystical turn alienated Mill and other scientific followers, but Comte did not seem to care. In 1848, only days after the revolution, Comte had founded the Société Positiviste, a club for his new modernist religion, and set on a mission to proselytize among other audiences (he would henceforth refer to himself as the ""Great Priest of Humanity"") with a stream of lectures, pamphlets and publications.  It became surprisingly quite popular and Comte's followers established chapters throughout France and overseas.   The Positivist Society's motto (""Order and Progress"") even found its way to be stitched on to the flag of the Republic of Brazil in 1889. Comte was dismissive of economics, seeing it as a subsidiary branch of his wider ""sociology"".   According to Comte, society should be analyzed as ""organisms"" with their own linear progress (through religious, metaphysical and scientific stages).  The ""positivist"" or ""empirical"" method of sociological analysis could (only) be applied to this final, scientific stage.  He disputed the economists' penchant for distinguishing between the economic and other aspects of social life.  Instead, Comte envisaged ""sociology"" as the umbrella under which all the social sciences -- including economics -- would be subsumed, thus enabling their integration.  This was a view that was, in fact, shared by several members of the German Historical School, the English and French historical schools and American Institutionalism, who would cite Comte against the attempt of Classical and later Neoclassical economics to posit economic behavior and decision-making as a universal constant, outside of historical and social context.

Charles Comte, 1782-1837,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/charlescomte.htm," François-Charles-Louis Comte (usually referred to merely as ""Charles Comte"") was a lawyer and journalist, one of the leaders of the French Liberal School during the Bourbon Restoration period.   Charles Comte was born in Sainte-Enimie, in the department of Lozère, in the Languedoc region of southern France. He studied law in Paris. Comte founder and editor of Le Censeur with fellow lawyer and former classmate Charles Dunoyer in 1814, in the hope to push France in a more liberal direction after the collapse of the Bonapartist Empire.  During Napoleon's ""hundred days"" in 1815, Comte bravely come out against Napoleon, notably with a tract on the incompatibility of constitutionalism under a military leader, and the journal was duly suppressed. The Censeur resumed after Waterloo, but went only for two more numbers before it was suppressed again. In the interim, Comte delved into economics, and was particularly energized by the re-appearance of the works of J.B. Say.  After meeting Say himself in 1815, Comte became an ardent proponent of laissez-faire. (Comte would eventually go on to marry Say's daughter in 1818). The Censeur was re-launched, under a new title, in 1817.  Disappointed that the old Mercantilist-Imperial economic policies were simply being renewed, Comte grew highly critical of the absolutist and illiberal tendencies of the Bourbon monarchs.  The second Censeur was suppressed in 1819, and Comte fled into exile in Switzerland in 1820 to escape a prison sentence.  Comte taught natural law at the University of Lausanne for a little while, before being forced to move again in 1823.  He was for a period in Britain, where he met his old hero, Jeremy Bentham, and reportedly wrote some articles for the Edinburgh Review (unclear which). Comte finally returned to France in 1825, and promptly set about writing his magnum opus, the Traité de législation (1827), with an emphasis on the limits of the role of the State in economic affairs.  This was followed up by his treatise on property (1834). Comte was an active participant in the July Revolution of 1830 which toppled the conservative Bourbons, and replaced them with the more liberal Orleanist regime.  He served briefly in the new chamber of deputies, before taking up a post at the newly re-created Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques in 1832 (which had been suppressed by Napoleon back in 1803). After Say's death in 1832, Comte set about editing his posthumous works (1833).      Major Works of Charles Comte   Resources on Charles Comte   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Etienne Bonnot de Condillac, 1714-1780.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/condillac.htm,"  Étienne Bonnot de Condillac, Abbé de Mureaux, was a French cleric, Enlightenment philosopher and logician. He was the younger brother of Abbé de Mably.  Born in Grenoble (Dauphinois), to a wealthy family of lawyers, recently risen to noblesse du robe, surnamed ""Bonnot de Mably"", after their properties in Mably (in the Lyonnais region of the Loire).   While the eldest brother Jean Bonnot de Mably pursued a political legal career in Lyons, the two younger brothers Gabriel and Étienne, pursued clerical careers.  To differentiate him from his brother, Étienne was surnamed ""Bonnot de Condillac"" (after another family property).  Condillac's early years are unclear.  A sickly child, he did not attend school and only learned to read at the late age of twelve. He eventually enrolled at a local Jesuit school in his late teens, and went on to study in the seminary of Saint-Sulpice in Paris.  He was ordained into the Catholic priesthood in 1740.  However much a sincere cleric, Condillac was never much inclined to his priestly duties.  His benefice from the abbey of Mureaux, gave him sufficient income and leisure to focus on his passion for philosophy and science.  Condillac was particularly enthralled by the English scientific-empirical tradition, in particular the works of Newton and Locke. His first treatise (Essai,1746) was essentially a popularization of Locke's ideas.  This was followed up by his 1749 Traité des systemes, an attack on the speculative rationalist French tradition, in favor of British empiricism, which was explosive in French intellectual circles.  In his 1754 Traité des sensations, Condillac made his most significant  philosophical contribution to that tradition, refusing Locke's distinction between sensations (from outer sense) and reflection (from inner sense. Condillac argued that external impressions through the outer senses can account for all ideas and all mental operations.      Condillac moved in the circle of the French Enlightenment philosophes.  He struck up an early friendship with Rousseau, when the latter was tutor to the family of his older brother Jean Bonnot, and Rousseau introduced him Diderot and the rest of the luminaries - Voltaire, d'Alembert, Helvetius, etc. His 1749 treatise was his calling card, and very influential on the Encyclopèdie, in which he was an early assistant editor. Condillac's philosophical career in France was interrupted by his appointment, in 1757, as tutor to the young Ferdinand Duke of Parma (grandson of king Louis XV of France), which forced him to move to Italy, and ate up much of his time.  He later published his tutor notes as the monumental 13-volume Cours d'études.  Condillac returned to France in 1768, where he was promptly elected to the  Académie française.  However, finding the increasingly irreligious atmosphere among the philosophers of Versailles and Paris a bit too much to bear, Condillac withdrew to the quiet seclusion of his country estates, turning down offers of official positions in the royal court. It was during this retirement that Condillac composed his main economic work (1776). It was remarkably prescient in his conception of interacting markets and competition.  Following up on Galiani, he developed a utility-cum-scarcity theory of value that anticipates the Marginalist Revolution by a century.  For Condillac, value depends on the utility of a commodity in relation to the subjective needs of those who use it, increasing or decreasing as these needs become more or less intense.  Condillac connected these variations with the degree of scarcity.  In his words: ""Value is not an attribute of matter, but represents our sense of its usefulness and this utility is relative to our need.  It grows or diminishes according as our need expands or contracts.  But since the value of things is based upon need, it is natural that a more keenly felt need should endow things with a greater value, while a less urgent need endows them with less.  Value increases with scarcity and diminishes with plenty."" (Condillac, 1776: Ch. I, Pt.1) Condillac's work has some parallels with the contemporary Physiocrats, it differed from them significantly in his unconditional rejection of the land theory of value, and insistence on a utility-determined ""true price"" (""vraix prix"") as the basis of rational allocation. But his work did not have polemics with Physiocrats in mind. He embeds it in a speculative history of economic development, explaining how economies go through phases of ""progress"" (characterized by rational allocation via ""true prices"" discovered by the market process)  and ""decline"" (characterized by misallocation, brought about by the misbehavior of the aristocracy and crown, interfering in markets and introducing distortionary ""false prices"").  Condillac's treatise coincidentally came out in the same year as Adam Smith's Wealth in Nations, but it is not a coincidence that both expounded a similar laissez faire view of markets. Condillac's theories -- in economics, philosophy and psychology -- were taken up by Destutt de Tracy and (less faithfully) by Jean-Baptiste Say, so can be regarded as one of the kernels of the French Liberal School. A century later, William Stanley Jevons would laud Condillac's ""charming philosophic work"" as ""perhaps the earliest distinct statement of the true connection between value and utility"" (Jevons, TPE, 1879 ed, p.xxx). Condillac's economic contributions had remained largely unknown to English-speaking writers until highlighted by H.D. MacLeod in 1863.

"Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet", 1743-1794. ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/condorcet.htm,"  French Enlightenment philosopher, mathematician, social scientist, economist, gentleman, politician and humanitarian.  The Marquis of Condorcet was perhaps the only giant of the Enlightenment present and involved at the 1789 Revolution.  Background Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, was born in Ribemont (near Saint-Quentin, Picardy).  His father, a cavalry captain, died in battle when the young Condorcet was only four. A sickly child, Condorcet was raised by his pious mother, assisted  by an uncle (a future Bishop of Lisieux).  It is insinuated in some sources that Condorcet's family were originally Huguenots from the Dauphiné that had since re-converted to Catholicism.(BdC).  Despite his noble ""Marquis"" title and rank, the Condorcet family seemed to lack any fiefs or landed property, and Condorcet's financial position was always precarious and dependent on the generosity of others.. At the age of eleven, Condorcet was placed at a Jesuit college in Rheims.  Condorcet demonstrated an early mathematical aptitude. He transferred in 1758 to complete his education at the prestigious Collège de Navarre in Paris. The sixteen-year-old Condorcet defended his thesis on mathematical analysis in 1759 before a committee of senior mathematicians that included the Encyclopediste Jean le Rond d'Alembert, making a great impression on them.  At the age of nineteen, with the financial support of the Duke of Rochefoucauld, Condorcet moved definitively to Paris in 1762, setting himself up as an independent scholar.  D'Alembert took him under his wing and served as his mentor and conduit to the Paris intelligentsia circles, introducing him to leading contemporary mathematicians like Jean-Louis Lagrange. Academician In 1764, Condorcet published his first work, an essay on integral calculus.  It was very well-received by the French scientific establishment. and was followed up by further treatises applying and extending his methods of integration. In March, 1769, Condorcet was elected to the prestigious Académie Royale des Sciences.  Condorcet was put to work composing a series of official biographies of 17th C. scientists for the academy.  Research for this project sparked Condorcet's interest in the history of science, which he would later work into his theory of civilizational progress.  In June, 1773, Condorcet was elected deputy and successor of Grandjean de Fouchy, the perpetual secretary of the Académie des sciences.  This raised some eyebrows, as Condorcet was still young and the astronomer Bailly had been previously promised that position.  The fingerprints of d'Alembert were visible in the maneuvering to raise his protegé - and given that d'Alembert himself had just been elected permanent secretary to the Académie française, there was an ill-feeling among some scientists (Buffon in particular) that d'Alembert was trying to erect an institutional despotism via Condorcet. In the 1760s and early 1770s, Condorcet's work was almost exclusively dedicated to pure mathematics, publishing mostly in the house journals of the Académie Royale des Sciences.  Besides his own articles, Condorcet was the author of numerous  anonymous prefaces to other people's articles (notably Laplace and Langrange) in the Histoire de l'Académie Royale des Sciences (HARS) in the early 1770s  Condorcet also continued putting out his string of eulogies of deceased scientists for the annals of the Academie.    In the early 1770s, D'Alembert persuaded Codorcet to contribute several articles on mathematical topics for the Encylopédie - not, of course, to the original edition (it had been finished when Condorcet was merely a boy), but rather for the Supplément volumes being prepared by Robinet.  However, delays to the publication of the Supplément led Condorcet to pull out his notable economics article - ""Monopole et Monopoleur"", written c.1775 - and publish it separately as a pamphlet.  However another 23 articles written by Condorcet, almost all on pure mathematics, would remain in the  Supplément volumes, which finally appeared in 1776-77.  They are notable for Condorcet's easy exposition of the considerable rapid advances in mathematics which had taken place in the last quarter-century, bringing the work of Euler and Lagrange to the fore. Disciple of Turgot Condorcet's interests soon began to expand.  In Paris, again through d'Alembert, Condorcet fell in with the  philosophes clique of Voltaire, Diderot, Condillac, etc. and was drawn to begin thinking about social and political topics. (An apparent turning point was Condorcet's extended visit to Voltaire in Fernay, in September-October 1770).  He also corresponded with the Italian wing of Beccaria and Verri. In 1774, Condorcet wrote an anonymous polemic defending the philosophes against the conservative Abbé Sabathier de Castres.   Condorcet was not happy with the manner in which the philosophes concentrated solely on demolishing traditional ideas about social order without positing anything to replace them.  It is partly for this reason that Condorcet (like d'Alembert) was drawn to the remarkable Physiocratic economist Jacques Turgot, whom he regarded as a constructive thinker.  Condorcet had been introduced to Turgot by d'Alembert back in 1769, at the famous salon of Mademoiselle Julie de Lespinasse.   Twenty years his senior, Turgot encouraged Condorcet to explore economic questions, and move from academic life to public service. After Louis XVI appointed Turgot as French minister of finance (contrôleur-général de finances) in 1774, Turgot promptly appointed d'Alembert and Condorcet to a state commission to inquire into navigable waterways.  Turgot later arranged to have Condorcet appointed at the head of the French Mint (inspecteur général des monnaies) in January 1775, a position Condorcet would hold for the next fifteen years.  Condorcet wrote his anonymous Lettres sure le commerce de grains in late 1774, in defense of Turgot's controversial edict liberalizing the grain trade.  But the policy was imperiled in the Spring of 1775, with bread riots in Paris and the ""Flour Wars"" out  in the countryside.  The riots were fanned by the appearance of an anti-Turgotian tract by the Neo-Colbertiste writer Jacques Necker.  Condorcet promptly wrote a reply against Necker in late 1775 (Du commerce du bleds), and followed it up with more anti-Necker, pro-Turgotian tracts, such as ""Monopole et Monopoleur"".   It was in reference to the the ferocity of these writings that d'Alembert would characterize Condorcet as an ""enraged lamb"" (""mouton enragé""), and a ""volcano covered in snow"" (""un volcan couvert de neige""), an allusion to Condorcet's otherwise outwardly calm and amiable disposition, as well as his prematurely white hair. The Turgotian era came to an end in June 1776, when Turgot was summarily dismissed by Louis XVI.  Condorcet immediately submitted his resignation in protest, but was persuaded by Turgot himself to stay on.  Condorcet had to swallow the humiliation of serving under his nemesis, Jacques Necker, who ascended to the controller-general position in October, 1776 and promptly reversed most of the Turgotian policies.  Return to the Academy Although continuing his position at the mint after the fall of Turgot, Condorcet detached himself from Necker's government, and focused on his academic activities.  The old enemies of d'Alembert who had made Condorcet's initial years at the Académie a bit difficult, were hardly pleased by the succession of government appointments Turgot had arranged for Condorcet.  They were particularly incensed when Turgot earmarked a significant portion of government funds designated for the ARS specifically to fund Condorcet's research.   In early 1775, in an apparent act of retaliation, they had the Académie appoint a committee of four to ""revise"" Condorcet's eulogies and threatened to set up permanent board of censors for his prefaces.  As a result, Condorcet suspended his academic writing and even renounced his right to succeed in the secretariat.  Nonetheless, when Grandjean de Fouchy finally retired in 1776, Condorcet was unanimously elected perpetual secretary of the Académie des Sciences on August 7, 1776.  Back in control, Condorcet promptly resumed the composition of eulogies for academicians, now extending his coverage to those lately deceased, composing more than fifty eulogies over the next decade - including Linnaeus (1778), Daniel Bernoulli (1782), d'Alembert (1783), Leonhard Euler (1783), Turgot's brother (1789) and Benjamin Franklin (1790). Condorcet used his eulogies not merely to hail individual men, but also as platform to explore his own ruminating ideas about the role of science, mathematics, and politics in society.   He held his nose to compose one for his old enemy Buffon (1788), but absolutely refused to write one for the Duke of La Vrillière, partly on account that the late minister had been an enthusiast of private arrest warrants (lettres de cachet).  This refusal reportedly annoyed the new French minister, the Count of Maurepas, who consequently blocked Condorcet's admission into the Académie française (BdC)    In 1777, Condorcet wrote a treatise on comets, which earned a prize from the Prussian Academy in Berlin.  That same year, he wrote an extensive eulogy to Michel d'Hôpital, the moderate French chancellor during the 16th C. wars of religion, whom he portrayed as a proto-philosophe, and defender of natural rights. Condorcet's eulogy to d'Hôpital was submitted to a competition for the Académie française.  Although it wasn't rewarded with a prize (possibly by Maurepas's intervention), it was well-received when published.  In 1776, Condorcet put out a new edition of the Pensées of Pascal, to which he added (in 1778) extensive notes and a ""Éloge to Pascal"".  Again, Condorcet tried to re-cast the 17th C. French philosopher as a modern philosophe.  He reinterpreted Pascal's pessimistic (some might say realistic) view of human nature, with all its faults and frailties, as subtly anticipating the Enlightenment's optimistic view of man, emphasizing that these deficiencies were not inherent in human nature, but the fault of social order.  The eloge to Pascal was much admired by Voltaire. Condorcet's activities at the academy dominated much of his time after 1776.  The Académie des Sciences was repeatedly called on by the government to organize scientific investigations - e.g. on the state of prisons, canals, and also to independently judge the validity of new scientific discoveries (often tricky, given the wave of pseudo-scientism that surged around this time, as many frauds tried cash in on the fashionable Enlightenment wave).  Condorcet had to assemble committees and oversee the delivery of their reports.   The Academy under Condorcet's directorship inquired into the hot-air balloons of the Montgolfier brothers, and confirmed their validity.  But Condorcet's Academy became engulfed in public controversy in 1779-80 when they turned down two notable charlatans: Franz Mesmer (who claimed to have discovered ""animal magnetism"") and Jean-Paul Marat (the future revolutionary firebrand was at this time claiming to have discovered a new theory of light, fire and electricity, much of which ran contrary to Newtonian physics).  Disappointed, Mesmer, Marat and their supporters denounced the Academy, and its director Condorcet in particular, in a barrage of verbal assaults in the public press, accusing them of corruption among other things.  Mathématique sociale Amidst all this, Condorcet also found some to return to mathematical writing, but it was no longer merely the pure analysis of yore. Condorcet had been recently turned on to probability theory and statistics, and quickly saw them as the key to apply mathematics to the political and social subjects he was interested in.  Condorcet hailed Laplace's ""inverse probabilities"" as the route to follow in all sciences (see preface of 1774, p.xviii).  Inspired by Lagrange's 1772 memoir (p.513) on planetary motion, in 1777 Condorcet appended a celebrated expository essay of the new method in a report on a canal commission.  He continued to drop reflections on the importance of budding science of mathematical probability to science in general and ""political arithmetic"" in particular, in various other writings, e.g. in the eulogy to Pascal (1778).  Condorcet invoked it in his controversy over population demographics with the hapless Moheau in the Mercure de France (1778-79).   The Count of Maurepras died in 1781, clearing the way for Condorcet's election to the Académie française in January 1782.  Condorcet's reception address talked about the prospect of applying mathematics to the social science, and not merely the natural ones. In his private life, Condorcet endemic financial difficulties were alleviated in 1783, when his old friend D'Alembert died, leaving his property to Condorcet.  This was compounded by the inheritance that Condorcet received from his uncle, the Bishop of Lisieux, who died the same year ([QR, p.16]) The Marquis de Condorcet was a consistent republican, a life-long opponent of slavery and an ardent proponent of economic liberalism.  Condorcet distanced himself from Rousseau's attempt to alter classic rationalism with sentiment, preferring instead to raise reason to the mathematical level.  Condorcet argued that the only social obligation is to obey the general reason, rather than the general will.  The will of the majority should be trumped if it fails to comply with reason.  In the social sciences, Condorcet is most famous for his mathematique sociale, his belief that socio-economic phenomena and policies ought to be studied and dealt with by mathematical and statistical methods.  Codorcet illustrated this in his own approach to questions of electoral suffrage.  Condorcet published his Essay in 1785, applying probability theory to voting situations, which is perhaps best known for its dim view of group rationality.  Among his results was the ""Condorcet theorem"", proving that if the individual probability of reaching a correct decision is less than half, then the probability that a voting assembly will reach the correct decision diminishes the greater the number of voters, and the ""Condorcet paradox"" that even if individual voter preferences are transitive, the collective outcome can exhibit intransitive preferences. Condorcet weighed various alternative voting schemes, reaching several more results (e.g. that supermajority is preferable to simple majority, and majority voting is preferable to forced unanimity).  But Condorcet overall conclusion was that there are no failsafe voting schemes and that efforts must be made to educate voters as enlightened and critical thinkers, in order to improve their chances of reaching a correct decision.   In 1786, Condorcet published a memorial to his fallen mentor Jacques Turgot (who had died back in 1781), that went beyond the usual eulogies, and allowed Condorcet to pontificate on the grander theme of government and the economy. Condorcet's plea for laissez-faire was couched in the abstract terms of reason and justice. ""In all classes of society, the particular interest of each naturally tends to blend with the common interest; and, as the rigorous application of justice obliges us to allow every individual to enjoy the freest use of his property, the general good of all is in accordance with this principle of justice.  Agriculture should be free, industry should be free, commerce should be free, interest on money should be free...What laws should society have on these objects?  Instituted to preserve for man his natural rights, obliged to watch for the common good of all, justice, the public interest prescribes that society bear legislation that ensures the freest exercise of the property of each, that does not establish any restrictions upon it and destroys any that remain, and prevents fraud or violence from establishing the contrary."" (Condorcet, 1786: p.208). On December 28, 1786, Condorcet married Marie Louise Sophie de Grouchy, who was then about half his age, and the sister of the future French general the Marquis de Grouchy.  She was an intellectual in her own right, who would go on to translate Adam Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments. After their marriage, the Madame de Condorcet hosted an important salon in Paris, attended at one time or other by famous luminaries like Thomas Paine, Abbé Morellet, Cesare Beccaria, Thomas Jefferson, and Adam Smith himself .  During the revolution, she also hosted the Cercle Social in their home. Sophie would later edit her late husband's works in 1804.  Their only child, a daughter Eliza (future countess O'Conner) would organize the 1847 edition of his collected works. Backed by his new wife, Condorcet became more active politically. Inspired by the 1787 British abolitionist society of Thomas Clarkson, the Marquis of Condorcet founded the Société des Amis des Noirs in February 1788 (bnf), along with Pierre Brissot (future Girondin) and Étienne Clavière (future Jacobin), .  Condorcet composed the Society's original regulations (bnf) and was elected its first president in January 1789 (bnf).  He was joined by notable friends like the Duke de Rochefoucauld, the American war hero Marquis de Lafayette  and future Paris mayor Jérôme Pétion in the abolitionist cause. In 1787, Condorcet re-edited an edition of Euler's famous letters to a German princess.  Two lectures on mathematics and probability, delivered at the Lycée in 1786 and 1787, along with his Élémens (wr. 1787, pub. 1805), were written around this time, planned by Condorcet to constitute a fourth volume to accompany Euler's letters.  To tie them together, Condorcet set out a comprehensive ""Tableau général de la science"".  However, the planned volume ended up not appearing.  Condorcet would go on revising and re-revising his Tableau, which only appeared in print after his death. Condorcet returned to political science in his ""Quattre lettres"", published in Filippo Mattei's 1788 treatise on the constitutional project of the United States (itself a reply to Mably).  Taking on the persona of an anonymous Virginia legislator, Condorcet proposes a unicameral legislature, based on an electoral process drawn from his 1785 Essay. Condorcet went on to demand constitutional restrictions to ensure legislation according the natural law, preserving equality before the law, free trade, laissez faire, freedom of religion, women's suffrage, etc. as being fundamental rights of man, and recommends the Physiocratic single land tax as the basis of public finances.  Condorcet's 1788 Essai picked up Turgot's Memoire on municipalities as the basis of his own ideas on government.  For Condorcet, like Turgot, the importance was not finding the ""general will"" (which Rousseau thought impossible anyway), but of finding ""general reason"".  The form of government in itself did not matter, whether or not it represented the will of the people did not matter.  What mattered is whether it can reach decisions conformable to reason and natural right, independent of petty self-interest and arbitrary preferences. Given the propensity of a single man, like an absolute monarch, or a small clique of ministers, to be wrong, Turgot had forwarded a plan for the formation of representative assemblies of property-owners, without distinction of rank or estate, as the best means to discover ""correct"" rational decisions. Political Career The French Revolution of 1789 opened up the unexpected opportunity for the Marquis de Condorcet to apply his ideas to France itself.  Facing imminent bankruptcy, in the late summer of 1788, King Louis XVI abruptly called for the Estates-General to convene for the first time in 175 years.  Condorcet's Essai on provincial assemblies, written earlier in the year, only came out from the printers in December, 1788 and was already obsolete.  Nonetheless, Condorcet enthusiastically contributed a series of instructive pamphlets addressed to electors and delegates, e.g  on instructions to give to delegates, on the Third Estate,  a French translation of the English 1689 Declaration of Rights,  a renewed plea for the abolition of slavery, a call for the exclusion of representatives of  slaveholders in the French colonies, etc.  As a nobleman, Condorcet was part of the second estate, and he assisted the composition of the cahiers de doleances for the nobility of Mantes (cahier) in March, and subsequently a commissioner for the cahier for the nobility of Paris (cahier in AP) in April, 1789.   But Condorcet did not manage to get elected as a delegate himself. For the pre-eminent constitutional scholar, former government economic official and long-time director of the Académie de Sciences, it must have been a sore disappointment to be forced to sit out of the greatest political event in France in decades.  Constituent Assembly (Jun 1789-Sep 1791) As the Third Estate defected to their own assembly in June 1789, Condorcet's ""Turgotian"" constitutional program was promoted by his friend and patron, the Duke of Rochefoucauld, as a model basis for the new National Assembly of France.  The Paris commune had been formed on Bastille day July 14, 1789 (his old academic rival, the astronomer Bailly, was elected mayor of Paris on the same day)     Condorcet promptly enrolled in the National Guard, and assisted Lafayette with its organization, but continued outside of the political process  .  This finally began to change on September 18, 1789, when Condorcet was elected to the municipal assembly of the Paris commune, as a representative of the left bank district of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-de-Prés.  Condorcet was dispatched to Versailles in October, as an emissary to confer and negotiate with the National Assembly on behalf of the Paris commune    During the Constituent Assembly phase (June 1789-Sep 1791) of the revolution, Condorcet watched from the sidelines.  Although not a member of that assembly, Condorcet could not resist commenting on the assembly's attempts to hammer out the first written constitution for France.   Condorcet joined discussion clubs, printed articles in the press and put out pamphlets. Condorcet was among maybe only a handful of people in France at the time already exhibiting republican inclinations.  Condorcet considered the formula of a constitutional monarchy to be an absurd contradiction, and warned against it, calling it a fatal flaw in the eventual Constitution of 1791. He came out against against bicameral formulas, and argued strenuously for a single unicameral legislature.  He pushed for the widest democratic net possible, agitating against property qualifications (marc d'argent), for women's suffrage,  and equal rights for religious minorities and people of color.   All this made Condorcet a favorite of the popular left and alienated him from fellow nobles.  He welcomed the abolition of feudal privileges and the hereditary nobility. He dropped his ""marquis"" title, and began thereafter referring to himself merely as ""Condorcet""  (it was Condorcet who, a couple of years later, moved the assembly to order the burning of all genealogical records of noble titles (see AP for June 19, 1792)). Condorcet's time in the Turgotian ministry was not forgotten, and from the outset, Condorcet deployed his experience in economic and fiscal matters to comment on economic policy.   Even before the Estates had first met, Condorcet came out against plans, then being contemplated by Necker, for a note-issuing bank of credit and forced loans to overcome the immediate fiscal crisis. Condorcet denounced these ideas as unjust, and proposed instead the confiscation and sale of church property (this is before May 1789!) and the issue of notes secured on those anticipated revenues. .Condorcet's most practical contribution in this period was his plan for the reorganization of the royal finances into a centralized national treasury ('Trésor nationale""), and for his efforts, Condorcet was appointed by the king as one of its six commissioners.  He drew severe opposition from the nobility for his proposal to abolish the civil list (pensions granted by the crown to individuals).  But Condorcet also came under occasional political fire from the left, e.g. for his opposition to the creation of Assignats and for defending the preservation of the old alliance treaty with Spain (""Bourbon family pact"").   In February 1790, Condorcet joined Dupont de Nemours, La Rochefoucauld, Sièyes and other moderates disenchanted with the factionalism in the Jacobins Club and formed the ""Société de 1789"", dedicated to a free constitution and the advancement of a liberal society (Condorcet wrote the Society's initial articles, separating themselves firmly from both from the Jacobins and the monarchical Feuillants).  Condorcet and Dupont were the editors of the society's Journal (which ran from June 5  to September 15, 1790).  Some famous Condorcet political pieces, notably articles against property qualifications (marc d'argent) and in favor of women's suffrage, were published here.  He also made some contributions to Le Bouche de Fer, the mouthpiece of the Cercle Sociale, a proto-republican society.  In February 1790, Condorcet also founded a literary review of his own, Bibliothèque de l'homme public, with Le Peysonnel and Le Chapelier, which would run for two years. He (and the others - exact partition of authorship is unclear) composed reviews of numerous great writers on political philosophy and economics - from Aristotle to Adam Smith.  Evidently, these were the works and ideas that the Condorcet believed the public, and statesmen in particular, should be reading at this historic moment.  Condorcet had read Adam Smith a few years prior, and handed his copious notes over to the poet Antoine Roucher, for a new French translation of the Wealth of Nations.  The translation finally appeared in1790, but Roucher had promised to print an extra volume with Condorcet's notes, but it never materialized.  Condorcet's notes on Smith - or a part of them anyway- were probably those published as a review of Smith in the Bibliothèque in 1790.  It is also the Bibliotheque where where he also first laid out his comprehensive scheme for a new system of public education for France in 1791. The old system of national education, largely in the hands of religious authorities, was in a state of shambles and inadequate for the post-revolutionary era,  Already aware (from his 1785 work) that an educated populace was vital, he was also adamant about ensuring that the education system would not devolve into a propagandist tool for ""correct"" moral and political opinions.  The objective, Condorcet asserted, was to ensure a free universal system of enlightened instruction, where students would trained to become independent, critical thinkers, rather than be drilled by their teachers in the ""right"" opinions.  This, Condorcet confidently asserted, would cultivate a citizenry inclined to reason, truth, natural right and the common good, and be less swayed by politics, petty self-interest and majority opinion.  To this end, Condorcet proposed the formation of ""learned companies"" (compagnies de savants) in each district to be put in charge of the public education system.  These local companies would be coordinated and overseen by a ""national company"" (Société Nationale)  in Paris, composed of scholars and scientists, who chose their own members, thus ensuring the independence of the educational system from politics.  It was not hard to detect that Condorcet was effectively taking his Académie de Sciences as the central model, and by franchise branches, placing it at the top of a national education system.  Control of the education system by independent scholars and scientists, a long cherished goal of the Enlightenment philosophes, which seemed only a dream to Voltaire, Rousseau and the Encyclopédistes, was now approaching reality. After the king's flight to Varennes in June 1791, Condorcet came out strongly and more openly against the monarchy.  Condorcet joined Thomas Paine in briefly editing the short-lived newspaper Le Républicain, calling for the abolition of the monarchy and the introduction of a republic.  It ran for only a few numbers in July, 1791 - his newspaper was abandoned in the crackdown after after the Champs de Mars massacre. Legislative Assembly (Oct 1791-Aug 1792) After the 1791 constitution came into effect, despite his misgivings against its preservation of the monarchy, Condorcet stood and was elected as a member of the new Legislative Assembly on September 26, 1791, as a delegate of Paris  [JdP, AP]. For three weeks, starting October 22, 1791, Condorcet contributed a regular column on the National Assembly to his old haunt, the Journal de Paris, but was soon dismissed.  He transferred the column to the Chronique de Paris from November 17.  He would remain a regular contributor for about a year and a half.  But it was a rigorous political news column, largely journalistic, which did not give Condorcet room for his more reflective commentary and speculative talents.  To that end, while still doing his diligence for the Chronique de Paris, Condorcet also started contributing articles to a more argumentative review, the Chronique du Mois (no relation to the other).  In a speech before the assembly (October 25, 1791), Condorcet proposed strong measures against  émigrés (French nationals, often royalists, who had fled abroad) - specifically, Condorcet proposed to require every French citizens, including those residing abroad, to swear a civic oath.  Any émigré that refused would be deprived of citizenship and forfeit any property left behind in France.  It was well received in the assembly, and ordered printed, but Condorcet's proposal was ultimately rejected  for even stronger measures - on November 9, the assembly decided simply to declare all émigrés as ""suspects conspiring against the nation"" (CGD).   Condorcet took the lead in authoring a Declaration (Dec 29) on behalf of the Assembly to foreign nations, threatening war if the émigrés were allowed to continue their activities.  It included a declaration of just war principles, eschewing any conquests but asserting France had the right of self-defense. Condorcet's declaration was received with enthusiasm in the Assembly, and promptly ordered to be printed and sent to every unit of the National Guard and every departement in France. That same day, the still-giddy Assembly promptly voted 20 million in advance for any future war effort. [CGD] The previous day (Dec 28), Condorcet had made another speech (also ordered printed) that urged fellow delegates to demonstrate unity between the Assembly and king's ministers, by passing the king's legislation rather than engage in confrontational tactics, but at the same time proposed procedures by which ministers would produce regular reports to the assembly.    Shortly after his election, Condorcet had been appointed (October 14, 1791) to the education committee (Comité d'Instruction publique, composed of 24 members).  The committee set aside Talleyrand's education plan, on account for its excessive room for religious instruction, and appointed a smaller commission led by Condorcet to draft a new plan.  Condorcet's views gradually prevailed, and the commission presented a draft plan to the rest of the committee in February 1792.  After two months of debate in committee and some minor amendments, the proposal was ready to be submitted to the Legislative Assembly. On a curious note, Condorcet's presentation of his comprehensive public education plan on 20 Apr 1792 was abruptly interrupted by King Louis XVI's entry into the assembly to request a declaration of war on Austria (AP), kicking off the French Revolutionary Wars. On the spot, Condorcet delivered an oration articulating the French case for the war (Apr 20), which was so well-received that the assembly agreed to have it published and distributed to the army. Condorcet's presentation of his education plan was resumed the next day Apr 21. A vote on the education plan was postponed pending an inquiry into its projected expenses.  It would remain on the burner for over a year.  It was read again on May 25, but adjourned again.  Attempts to revive the project in August, 1792 were overtaken by other political events.  The war did not resolve the tensions between the king and the assembly.  In early  June 1792, the king dismissed his Girondin ministers, and surrounded himself with the old conservative feuillants, who advised a more obstructionist course.  The reverses of the French army in the field and uprisings in the provinces brought concern that the king was actually banking on a counter-revolution by force of arms. The Assembly had already established a Commission extraordinaire (or ""Commission of Twelve"") in March to ""to inquire into the troubles affecting the kingdom"", but as it was dominated by monarchists, it turned a blind eye to the threats.  To redress the imbalance, the Assembly reorganized the Commission on June 18, appointing Condorcet as one of nine supplementary members (thus bringing the number up to twenty-one).  The Commission promptly began discussing what constitutional means were available for the legislative assembly to overcome the obstructionist king (still the formal executive).  Partly on Condorcet's initiative, the commission came up with a formula, and on July 11, the Assembly voted to declare ""the fatherland in danger"" (""La patrie est en danger"") and assume emergency executive powers for itself, allowing it to ignore the king's will or veto.  These executive powers were effectively vested in the Commission extraordinaire (foreshadowing the future Committee of Public Safety).  On July 21, Condorcet was elected the chairman of the Commission (CSP intro),.  Thus, all of a sudden, Condorcet was effectively the chief executive of France! In the prelude to this legislative coup, Condorcet had advised Commission and the Assembly to take care to remain strictly constitutional to the letter and, on July 6, had drafted an address to the king explaining the fatherland-in-danger motion, and proposed decrees to regulate the responsibilities of ministers (July 6), the sale of the seized property of émigrés (July 6) and procedures for the appointment of fiscal and treasury officials (July 6).  A month later, in early August, Condorcet's Commission was exploring the constitutional tools available for the deposition of the king outright.  Presentations on this were made before the Assembly on August 3rd and 9th.  But the street took matters into its own hands.  On August 9, 1792 Danton's club forcibly took over the Paris Commune, and the next day, Parisian mobs and National Guardsmen stormed the Tuileries Palace.   That evening, the Assembly simply voted to suspend the remaining powers of the king. In his writings of this period, Condorcet limited himself to calling for a new convention to amend the constitution (without explicitly talking about suppressing the monarchy).  His wish came true by the end of August, when the Legislative Assembly was dissolved a new constitutional convention (""National Convention"") called, with delegates to be elected by universal suffrage. National Convention (Sep 1792-June 1793)  The monarchy was abolished on September 22, 1792, only the second day after the Convention opened, and the French Republic declared. On Oct 11, 1792, Condorcet was appointed to the Convention's committee (along with Abbé Sieyès, Thomas Paine, Jacques Brissot, George Danton and some others) to draft a new constitution for the French Republic, to replace the outdated 1791 monarchical constitution.. Finally being given a platform to apply his theories, Condorcet threw himself into the work on a constitutional draft.  But academic perfectionism, in-committee quarrels and work on other commissions (e.g. defense) would delay and extend this process for many months.  His new busy schedule also kept him from his journalistic and philosophical recreations.  In January 1793, Condorcet took on a co-writer Launay d'Angers, for his Chronique de Paris column in January 1793, but his more reflective output in the Chronique du Mois declined precipitously.  The delay in Condorcet's constitution was fateful, as events would not wait for the savants to cross the t's and dot the i's.  As the new republic was forced to chug along on uneasy ground without a clear constitutional foundation, it created much uncertainty and instability.  Lack of a republican constitution fed the hopes of royalists (and stoked the fears of radicals) of a monarchical restoration.  This prospect eventually led to the trial and execution of the deposed king Louis XVI in January 1793. The Montagnards voted for death, while most Girondins voted for death but with suspended sentence. Condorcet implicitly voted for death - more precisely, he voted for the ""gravest sentence available"" against Louis XIV, but could not bring himself to positively vote for death, out of his opposition to the death penalty in principle (Jan 17); he abstained on the vote for suspending the sentence (Jan 19).  Finally, on February 15, 1793, the new constitution, a sprawling document with 370 articles, was presented by Condorcet's committee to the National Convention.  It included a declaration of rights, the abolition of the death penalty and a revival of his scheme for universal public education (which had been stalled since December 1792). For the executive, it envisaged seven ministers of state directly elected by the people. However, it also contained a controversial proposal to re-draw the boundaries of the electoral constituencies, so that great urban centers (like Paris) would not be over-represented.  The constitution was acceptable to the Girondins in the convention, but it was strenuously opposed by the Jacobins (now in charge of the ""Montagnard"" faction), as urban centers were precisely where their supporters were concentrated.  Acrimonious debate over the constitutional draft would drag out for the next few months. In March, 1793, Condorcet published an article in the Chronique du Mois, apologizing for his delays on the constitutional draft, but defending it as the best version possible.  That same month, on March 9, 1793, the printing house of the Chronique de Paris was shut down, and Condorcet ceased writing his journalist column.  Aloof of the gathering clouds, in May 1793, Condorcet founded a new journal, with Abbé Sièyes and Duhamel, the Journal d'instruction social, contributing more academic articles, including his famous ""Tableau"" of the sciences.  The unsettled framework of the country had encouraged demands from the provinces for a decentralized federal structure, which led to violent uprisings throughout the Spring of 1793.  As these were perceived as favorable to Condorcet's draft, it increased radicals' suspicion of it.  Through these months, the continued lack of an executive led the Convention to vest increasing powers in Robespierre's Committee of Public Safety (Comité de Salut Publique, its small, closed form finalized in April, 1793), a makeshift solution which would soon turn for the worst.  On May 29, Robespierre's CSP decided to appoint a new five-man committee, headed by Herault de Seychelles, to draft an alternative, more acceptable constitution from scratch.  It took them only a few days. The new Jacobin constitution was slimmer - merely 124 articles. It vested executive power in a council of 24 appointed by the assembly (and thus controlled by the majority party)   Before they could protest, the Girondins were purged from convention on June 2.  It was a foregone conclusion which of the competing drafts the radical Montagnard rump Convention would adopt. Condorcet's careful, thorough, intellectual constitution was set aside, and on June 24, the Convention adopted the CSP's hastily-drafted ""Constitution of Year I"", after only minor amendments in a single session. The Jacobin constitution effectively enshrined a revolutionary government in the hands of a CSP with unlimited powers.  Fugitive (July 1793-Mar 1794) A bitter Condorcet wrote an article in the Chronique du Mois denouncing the defeat of his constitution.  It accused the CSP-appointed drafters of incompetence and working under an atmosphere of threat and fear.  Condorcet went on to openly compare the CSP to an absolute monarchy - alien, tyrannical and above the law.  The unusually passionate language of Condorcet's article was his death warrant..  On July 8, 1793, Chabot read the offending passages before the National Convention, and the raucous Montagnards promptly voted in viva voce for the arrest of ""citoyen Caritat dit Condorcet"".. For the next ten months, Condorcet was a wanted, hunted fugitive.  There was no hope of reprieve - as the atmosphere only worsened, with the CSP introducing its terreur policy in the following months, escalating the scale of denunciations, arrests and executions.  Anyone who assisted Condorcet, or merely failed to denounce his whereabouts, were risking their own lives.  Fleeing his home (@505 Rue de Lille), Condorcet remained for the next eight months in Paris, hidden in the townhouse of his cousin Madame Vernet  (at 15 Rue Servandoni gmap).  It was reportedly Madame de Condorcet, at Mme Vernet's request, who persuaded Condorcet to throw himself into a new work, to pass his time. Condorcet contemplated writing a biographical memoir, underlining his public service, and role in the revolution, to impugn the injustice of his persecution.  But in the height of the terror, such an apologetic piece would likely serve no purpose. Probably sensing he had little time left, Condorcet decided to give posterity a different production, a comprehensive summary of his social philosophy. The result was the Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progrès de l'esprit humain, Condorcet's great humanitarian tract on the progress of the human spirit.  Warned about an imminent search of Mme Vernet's home, Condorcet left Paris on March 25, 1794, and proceeded through the countryside on foot.  He initially sought asylum in the home of Suard in Fontenay-aux-Roses (south of Paris).  But he ended up not staying there - according to some, Suard turned him away; but Suard's memoirs suggest that Condorcet himself deemed it was too risky to stay there.  Condorcet made his way to an inn in Clamart-de-Vignoble, but his exhausted, disheveled appearance prompted the innkeeper to turn him away, assuming he was a penniless vagabond.  When Condorcet pulled out a gentleman's wallet full of assignats, to prove he could pay, it immediately raised suspicions.   Evasive answers led some of the inn clients to denounce him to the local authorities.  Interrogated in the midnight hours of 27 to 28 March, Condorcet presented himself as a dismissed valet ""Pierre Simon"", who had left Paris and was looking for work. But his story failed to persuade the committee, who placed him under arrest. Condorcet was dispatched under guard to Bourg-la-Reine, where he was incarcerated in a house turned into makeshift prison (at 49 Grande Rue, now 81 Ave Le Clerc, gmap).  The next day, in the late afternoon of March 30, ""Pierre Simon"" was found dead in his cell.  Although it is often assumed Condorcet took his own life in prison, with a poison pill he carried, it is also possible that the that the 51-year-old Condorcet may simply have succumbed naturally from the exhaustion of his flight. Condorcet's remains were buried in a pauper's grave somewhere in the cemetery of Bourg-le-Reine (now Place Condorcet).  Although his remains were never found, ashes from Bourg-le-Reine were symbolically re-interred in a Condorcet memorial at the Pantheon in Paris in 1989. Esquisse Condorcet's  Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progrès de l'esprit humain was published posthumously in 1795. Although written during his most desperate hour, it revealed his confidence in reason, his optimism on social progress and the the continual improvement or ""perfectability"" of man.  In the Esquisse, Condorcet accepts the Enlightenment axiom that man is naturally rational and free, or certainly has the capacity to become so, but has been constrained by external reality - whether by environmental challenges (urgency for survival, limited technology, etc) or by artificial civilizational restrictions and imperfections of the social order (tyranny, superstition).  But he sees the history of humanity has been all about progressively lifting those external constraints, both technological and social, and allowing man's intellect and well-being to grow.   Condorcet lays out a conjectural history of humanity going through stages of advancement, with progressively greater scope for reason, scientific advancement and increasing prosperity, liberty and equality, each stage laying the groundwork for the next.  He breaks down human history into ten ""epochs"".  He starts off with prehistoric men coming together in population centers (1st Epoch), pastoral peoples (2nd Epoch), agricultural peoples up to the invention of the alphabet (3rd Epoch), progress in Classical Greece up until the division of sciences in the time of Alexander (4th Epoch), progress of sciences until the decline of the Roman empire (5th Epoch), dark ages up to the recovery of knowledge in the 11th C. crusades era (6th Epoch), Medieval scholasticism up to the 15th C. invention of the printing press (8th Epoch), scientific revolution from Descartes to the French Revolution (9th epoch), prospects for the future (10th epoch). The published Esquisse was only intended to be the introduction and outline of a projected monumental treatise, which would give the history of mind and society in more detail. There are fragments of Condorcet's writing on the history of some of the epochs (1st, 4th, 5th and 10th), which were appended to later editions, as well as the curious fragment of ""Atlantide"" (a commentary on Bacon's New Atlantis), on the combination of the human spirit for scientific progress.  Condorcet's objective was not to serve merely as a reference work on a comprehensive history of science, but rather to illustrate the dynamics of scientific discovery, its necessary social conditions, its impact, not only in terms of enlargement of truth and improvement of human understanding but also in how they are practically deployed for the greater welfare and happiness of society, and (more ominously) the conditions which cause them to decline and fall.. Condorcet's final epoch lays out the confidence in human ""perfectability""  (""nature has fixed no limits to our hopes"").  He predicts a near-utopian future for humanity, the emergence of a world of liberty, equality and prosperity, with human affairs guided purely by reason. In contrast to utopian  writers, Condorcet does not imagine absolute equality - he recognizes technology requires specialization,  some must be laborers, some managers, others teachers, etc.  But he believes labor need not be onerous nor the laborer poor.  (""actual equality, the chief end of the social art, which diminishing even the effects of the natural difference of the faculties, leaves no other inequality subsisting, but what is useful to the interest of all, because it will favor civilization, instruction and industry, without drawing after it either dependence, humiliation or poverty"", 1795 p.318).  He believes inequality of wealth, inequality of income and inequality of education are the main obstacles to this, and the cause of tyranny.  But he doesn't see government interference as the solution to, but rather the cause of, inequality. Condorcet asserts that ""fortunes tend to equality"" (p.329), and disproportionate wealth is only maintained by fictitious laws and ill-thought institutions erected by the State, that  ""if an entire freedom of commerce and industry were brought forward"", wealth equalization would tend to follow.  But he recognizes there are other causes of inequality that may need to be addressed with new institutions.  Besides his pet project of universal public education, Condorcet also recommends setting up social savings schemes to help fund pensions and unemployment, and also serve as a source of credit to enable workers to start families. (p.331).  With human capacity unlimited, Condorcet does not expect a meritocracy, he expects there to be an equality of talents, as well as an equality among nations, sexes and races and, explicitly or implicitly, an end to slavery, religion, nationalism, imperialism,  sexism, racism and other things built on ill-conceived prejudices.  He goes on to conjecture that once poverty, vice, conflict, war and disease are eliminated by reason and scientific progress, men might enjoy lives of ""indefinite"" length (he does not quite say ""immortal"", but rather suggests that the average length of human life will be continually increasing, p.368) Condorcet's Esquisse was published in France after Robespierre's fall in late 1795, and an English translation appeared almost simultaneously.  It was widely disseminated and received many favorable reviews.  It prompted Robert Malthus to write his 1798 essay on population.  Malthus said Condorcet's optimism was misplaced, that any and all schemes for the material improvement of the poor will lead only to a population explosion and nullify the gains, and bring along a variety of moral and social evils (""misery and vice""), quite the opposite of perfectibility. Condorcet actually acknowledged that possibility, but set it aside, believing it would be long in the future before mankind hit that problem (p.345).  Malthus's essay, of course, was geared to showing that the problem was already here.

Salvatore Cognetti de Martiis, 1844-1901,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/cognetti.htm,"Italian economist at the University of Turin.. Salvatore Cognetti de Martiis originated from Bari (southern Italy).  He enrolled at the University of Pisa in 1861 in political-administrative studies, focusing on economics, producing a well-received laureate thesis (1865), and receiving his law degree in 1866.  Caught up in the Risorgimento fever, Cognetti de Martiis served as a volunteer in Garibaldi's militia and saw combat in the Tyrol during 1866. In 1867, he returned to Bari to serve a public school principal. In early 1868, Cognetti obtained a teaching post in political economy at the technical institute in Bari, but later that same year (Nov, 1868) received an appointment to the royal technical institute in Mantua, a post he would retain until 1876.  During this period, he also served as director of the daily newspaper Gazzetta di Mantova from 1870 to 1874, and subsequently became economics editor for the Perseveranza.  In 1876, Cognetti de Martiis became extraordinary (associate) professor at the University of Turin, ordinary (full) professor by 1878.  Cognetti de Martii's Forme primitive (1881) was probably his major work. Cognetti de Martiis was a member of the historicist Lombard-Venetian school.  He took over the Biblioteca dell' Economista in 1894, after the retirement of Boccardo.      Major Works of Salvatore Cognetti de Martiis     Resources on S.

Johannes Conrad, 1839-1915 ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/conrad.htm," German Historicist, professor at the University of Halle in Prussia. Raised in Danzig (East Prussia) from Prussian landlord stock, Johannes Conrad was educated at Berlin and Jena, completing his doctoral thesis in 1864 and his habilitation in 1868, under Bruno Hildebrand (whose daughter Conrad would soon marry). Johannes Conrad became a Privatdozent at the University of Jena in 1868, raised to full professor in 1870. In 1872, Conrad succeeded Gustav Schmoller at the University of Halle (Schmoller had gone on to Strasbourg). Conrad would remain at Halle for the remainder of his career. Part of the second generation of German Historic School, Johannes Conrad was a co-founder of the Verein fur Sozialpolitik in 1872 with Gustav Schmoller and Adolph Wagner.  Conrad succeeded his father-in-law Bruno Hildebrand as editor of the Jährbucher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik (JNS) in 1878, and the journal would frequently be referred to as ""Conrads Jahrbuch"".  Conrad taught several American graduate students, that would go on to form a significant wave, e.g.  Samuel Nelson Patten.  Johannes Conrad was also an editor of the Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften, a monumental German dictionary of economics.

Thomas Cooper, 1759-1840,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/cooper.htm,"English-born American jurist, scientist and educator.  Thomas Cooper was born in London, England,  into a wealthy landowning and manufacturing family from Lancashire.  Raised in Manchester at the early dawn of the industrial revolution. Thomas Cooper was educated at University College, Oxford, but left in 1779 without taking a degree, on account of his heterodox religious views.   Around 1781, Cooper made the acquaintance of  Joseph Priestley, who would serve as his lifelong intellectual mentor. Cooper subsequently delved into law at the Inns of Court and was called to the bar in 1787. He proceeded to the northern circuit, practicing as a barrister in Lancashire, while also spending time studying medicine.  Cooper eventually settled back in Manchester and became a partner in a calico printing company.  Cooper learned chemistry in order to experiment with new bleaching techniques. Sympathetic to radical causes, Thomas Cooper was enthused by the French Revolution and joined a variety of political societies, coming into contact with Paine and other radicals.  Cooper traveled to France in 1792, accompanied by James Watt (inventor of the steam engine), on a mission from the Manchester corresponding societies.  After their return to England, Cooper and Watt were labeled radicals by Edmund Burke, inducing Cooper to reply with a defiant pamphlet.  Cooper's radical activities brought him to the attention of suspicious British authorities. Shortly after the outbreak of the French revolutionary war in 1793, feeling political dissenters like himself were in danger and disappointed by the bloody turn of events inside France, Cooper decided to emigrate to America in late 1793.  Cooper settled in Northumberland, Pennsylvania in early 1794, where he was soon joined by his friend, Joseph Priestley later that year. Cooper became an American citizen in 1795 and carved out a name for himself as a lawyer in Pennsylvania. Cooper quickly delved into American political affairs, writing numerous articles in the Northumberland Gazette.  Cooper aligned himself with the Jeffersonian Democratic-Republican party and was particularly vocal in his opposition to the federalist Adams administration. Cooper was arrested in 1800, and imprisoned for six months under the Alien & Sedition Acts. When the Jeffersonians came to power in late 1800, Cooper was rewarded with state positions.  Cooper was made a district judge in 1806.  During his years as a judge, disenchanted by democratic politics, Cooper's political ideas shifted, and he re-aligned himself closer to the federalists, angering his old republican comrades.  Faring poorly in his judicial duties, Cooper was drummed out of office by 1811, at the request of the Pennsylvania legislature.  In the interim, Priestley had died and Cooper inherited his laboratory and set about writing memoirs of Priestley's work, reviving his own interest in chemistry. After his dismissal from the bench, Thomas Cooper entered upon an academic career, facilitated by his new federalist friends. Cooper served as a professor of chemistry at Carlisle (now Dickinson) College in 1811, and then at the University of Pennsylvania in 1815.  By this time, Cooper's economic views had also dramatically shifted, and he briefly became an advocate of the protectionist cause, popular in Pennsylvania, which he had earlier denounced.  This was also among his more active publishing periods. Cooper edited numerous works, including the Emporium, a compilation of recent scientific discoveries. Convinced of the links between medicine and chemistry, Cooper tried to secure a simultaneous appointment in the faculty of medicine at Penn in 1818 (it failed).  Despite the protean shifts in his political and economic stances, Thomas Cooper retained the friendship and admiration of Thomas Jefferson,  who considered Cooper ""the greatest mind in America"".  In 1817, Cooper was handpicked by Thomas Jefferson to become the first professor of chemistry, natural science and law - indeed the very first professor nominated - at the newly-founded University of Virginia.  But delays in opening of the university and the opposition of the local Presbyterian clergy over Cooper's religious views made the position at Virginia untenable before he even taught his first class.  Cooper saved Jefferson from an embarrassing quandary by resigning from Virginia to take up an appointment  at South Carolina College (future University of South Carolina) in Charleston, SC in late 1819.  Thomas Cooper's appointment was initially to teach chemistry.  The death of South Carolina president Jonathan Maxcy in the summer of 1820 led to the appointment of Cooper (then in his sixties, the oldest professor on the faculty) as president pro tempore.  Despite rumblings by conservative clerics, Thomas Cooper was made permanent President of South Carolina College in December 1821. As was customary at the time, college presidents had the duty to teach the final year ""philosophy"" course, a generic course that ranged over politics, law, ethics, etc. to finish off the classical education of undergraduates. Before Cooper's arrival, South Carolina had partitioned the final year duties between the President Maxcy (who taught metaphysics) and Robert Henry, a dedicated professor of moral philosophy.  Cooper was expected to take over the metaphysics course, but petitioned the South Carolina trustees to transfer metaphysics to Henry, and allow him to teach a course in political economy instead. As a result, Thomas Cooper is often credited as being the first person to teach a dedicated course on economics at an American college. Thomas Cooper's economics course at  South Carolina was launched in early 1825. Cooper's course relayed conventional British Classical economics of Smith and Ricardo.  Cooper initially relied on Marcet's Conversations for his text before switching over to McVickar's reprint of McCulloch.  But Cooper soon wrote his own book of Lectures (1826) which he would use as a textbook through the remainder of his tenure at South Carolina.  Although well-received, Cooper's textbook was not widely adopted - partly because of its heavier-than-usual economic content, partly because of its unrelenting defense of laissez-faire and free trade. Cooper had shifted economic stance once again (e.g. 1823) and now became a favorite target of the the protectionist American System economists, like Matthew Carey.  Cooper's lessons filtered into the South Carolina elites, and his ideas were made use of in the political quarrels of the day - notably over tariff policy.  During the nullification crisis of 1829, Cooper came out openly for secession.  Betraying his earlier radical abolitionist roots, Cooper reconciled himself to slavery, and even owned slaves himself.   Despite his compatibility and even adulation by the South Carolina political elites, ultimately, it was Cooper's heterodox religious views (most scandalously his 1829 Fabrications of the Pentateuch) which sank him.  Conservative clerics stepped up their pressure for his dismissal. They made use of his political remarks on nullification to charge him as unsuitable, and force an investigation by the Board of Trustees of South Carolina College in 1831.  Although Cooper was acquitted, he was exhausted and declining enrollments led to questions about his leadership of the institution.  In November 1833, Cooper resigned the presidency, and resumed his position as merely professor of chemistry.  Moral philosopher Robert Henry took over the college presidency and the political economy courses, but it did not last for long.  The enrollment situation had reached such a critical level, that the Board of Trustees fired the entire faculty  (Cooper included) in December 1834, and set about reconstructing South Carolina College anew.  Francis Lieber would inherit the mantle of Cooper as professor of history and political economy at South Carolina in late 1835, using Cooper's lectures as his base.   In his retirement, Thomas Cooper was induced by the Governor of South Carolina to help compile the state's laws, producing the first five volumes of the Statutes at Large of South Carolina, which began to appear in 1836.

Nicolaus Copernicus, 1473-1543,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/copernicus.htm," Famous 16th Century Polish astronomer, mathematician and clergyman.   In 1543, Copernicus published his most famous treatise, De Revolutionibus Orbium, presenting, for the first time, a completely ""heliocentric"" theory of astronomy (i.e. that the planets revolve around the sun).  This theory was not articulated with revolutionary ardor.  Rather, it was a practical proposition, by which Copernicus hoped to reconcile the conflicting observations which had forced astronomers to add epicycles upon epicycles to make the old Ptolemaic theory ""work"".   That the hypothesis also undermined Aristotelean cosmology and Biblical scripture did not seem to occur to him. Copernicus's treatise was not proscribed by the Church until the 17th Century, after firebrands like Bruno and Galileo had taken up the heliocentric system with revolutionary zeal. Copernicus' methodology of ""reducing"" conflicting empirical observations to ""single"" causes also applies to his famous 1526 work on monetary theory (it was not published until the 19th Century).  Contemporary theorists had argued that general price inflation could be generally attributed to a reduction in the ""intrinsic metal content"" of coins.  This certainly seemed to confirm the empirical observation that currency debasements were usually followed by inflation.  However, this failed to account for other episodes of inflation which were not clearly attributable to currency debasement.  Observers had speculated that these other episodes were due perhaps to ""clipping"", ""forgery"" and other shenanigans that reduced the ""intrinsic content"" of coins.   As he had done in astronomy, Copernicus must have sensed the  ""epicycles-upon-epicycles"" character of these ""further"" explanations and proposed a single unifying theory: the Quantity Theory of Money.  In his 1526 tract, Copernicus identified the single common cause of all inflation as the general increase in the quantity of coins minted from any given metal basis.  This theory was later discovered (independently) by Bodin, Davanzati, Navarrus and the Salamanca scholars.        Major Works of Copernicus   Resources on Copernicus   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Edward Copleston, 1776-1849,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/copleston.htm," English cleric, theologian and logician at Oriel College, Oxford, Edward Copleston may be regarded as the founding father of the ""Oxford-Dublin School"". By all accounts, Edward Copleston was a man of prodigious talents and wide interests. Copleston graduated from Corpus Christi College and was subsequently elected fellow at Oriel College, Oxford in 1795.  He obtained his M.A. and a tutorship at Oriel in 1797. Oriel was then under John Eveleigh (Provost of Oriel from 1781 to 1814).  Copleston was Oxford Professor of Poetry from 1802 to 1812, and wrote, during this time, his famous ""Advice to a Young Reviewer"", a satire on English literary criticism, published as a pamphlet in 1807.  He also wrote another satirical piece, ""The Examiner Examined"" in 1809 skewering Robert Kett's elementary book on logic.  In 1814, Copleston succeeded Eveleigh as provost of Oriel, a position he held until 1827, when he became Bishop of Llandalf in Wales. Under Copleston's tutelage, Oriel College became arguably the most intellectually-accomplished (and ambitious) college at the University of Oxford.  Copleston mentored a generation of fellows and students at Oriel known as the ""Noetics"" (Greek for ""reasoners""), that flourished in the 1810s and 1820s, which included John Davison, Richard Whately, Edward Hawkins, Renn Dickson Hampden, Thomas Arnold, Baden Powell,  J. Blanco White and others. Oriel Noetics acquired (and cultivated) a reputation as hyper-intellectuals, the leading lights of the university. They also constituted the Oxford branch of the ""Broad Church"" movement, promoting liberal theology and freedom of enquiry, which often stood in stark contrast to the stuffy conservative ""High Church"" Tory outlook that dominated much of the university at the time. The future leaders of the ultra-conservative Oxford Movement (""the Tractarians""), notably John Keble, John Henry Newman, Edward Pusey and Hurrell Froude, were cultivated at Oriel during Copleston's tenure, but later (1830s) revolted against the liberal outlook Copleston had promoted.

Copleston was an accomplished Aristotlean scholar and logician and promoted the centrality of logic in the Oxford curriculum (Copleston's lectures and notes on logic, ostensibly inspired by Dugald Stewart's ""philosophy of the mind"", were the basis of Whately's later work).  In 1808 and 1809, three articles appeared in the Edinburgh Review  which questioned the value of Aristotlean logic and classical learning in the Oxford curriculum, at the expense of modern subjects, notably mathematics and political economy (the most vigorous attack was identified to be authored by Sydney Smith, himself a graduate of New College, Oxford). Copleston's combative Reply to the Calumnies (1810) can be considered the ""Noetic manifesto"", defending the centrality and usefulness of logic. It also set out the attitude to the study of economics (which would be carried almost unchanged decades later by Copleston's principal disciple, Richard Whately).  Copleston notes that knowledge of political economy is essential to statesmanship, and that ""the science has a tendency, if rightly studied, to enlarge the mind"" (1810: p.172), but that it should not be studied exclusively. Other fields, notably religion and the classics, are also necessary, if nothing else, to provide the normative basis of the field and logic, naturally, for clarity of thought. Copleston heaps praise on Adam Smith for having demonstrated scientifically how to increase the wealth of nations, but ""in truth, national wealth is not the ultimate scope of human society"" (p.108-09). Smith, Copleston asserts, had explained the means to that end, but ultimately ""it is the value of the end that must determine the value of the means"" (p.165), and in this a wider education is essential. Economists, Copleston warns, are ""prone to usurp over the rest"", and ""the pedant in political economy is not disagreeable only, but dangerous."" (p.174). Although keeping logic as central, Edward Copleston encouraged inquiry and discussion on political economy in the Oriel common room, and dabbled in the field himself. His Oxford prize essay on agriculture (1796) foreshadows his more famous 1819 tracts on the bullion crisis and agricultural pauperism, both published anonymously in 1819 under the guise of letters to Sir Robert Peel - emblazoning, on its cover, the old French liberal slogan, ""Laissez nous faire"". Copleston blamed poverty and agricultural distress on inflation. Copleston hypothesized that commodity prices tend to adjust faster than wages, with the result that the debasement of the currency, by driving up commodity prices quicker than wages, has had a tendency of pushing real wages down. The Poor Laws, Copleston claims, have been merely a historical response - and an ill-thought and inefficient one - to such periods of inflation-induced distress in the past. He assaults the Poor Laws, particularly the Speenhamland form, for encouarging employers to lower wages below subsistence, confident that the parish will make up the difference. In his1822 article in the Quarterly Review on the state of the currency, Coppleston takes a strict bullionist  position, and approvingly quotes Ricardo and Huskisson, although Ricardo would express his displeasure and complain that Copleston ""put sentiments in my mouth that I never uttered"" (Ricardo, letter to Malthus, Dec 16, 1822, p.212). It is probable that Copleston was instrumental in bringing the Drummond chair to be established at Oxford in 1825.  During his tenure, Copleston was engaged in competition for influence with Charles Lloyd, the effective leader of Christ Church College (Oriel's main rival), and a quintessential High Tory, who had been Sir Robert Peel's tutor (Charles Lloyd was also the older brother of the economist W.F.Lloyd).  It culminated in a competition between Copleston and Lloyd for the Regius Professorship of Divinity and the Bishopric of Oxford which, with Peel's help, finally went to Lloyd in 1827.  Copleston was assigned the Bishopric of Llandaff in Wales in 1827, as a consolation prize (although its obscure location seemed almost designed to remove him from influence).  The Noetic Edward Hawkins succeeded Copleston as Provost of Oriel in 1828.  But there is little doubt that Edward Copleston's principal disciple and intellectual successor was Richard Whately , who inherited Copleston's mantle as spokesman of Broad Church liberalism and Aristotlean philosophy at Oxford.  Whately's celebrated works on logic and economics drew much upon Copleston's own work. Whately carried on Copleston's influence at Oxford, until he himself departed in 1831.

Robert of Courçon, c.1160-1219,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/courcon.htm,"Also known as Robert Courson, he was an English Scholastic, ardent campaigner against usury and formative chancellor of the university of Paris. Originally from Derbyshire, England, Robert of Courçon may have spent some time at Oxford before moving to Paris to study under Peter the Chanter.  He was canon of Noyon and moved to Paris in 1195. Robert of Courçon was elected chancellor of the university of Paris in 1211, shortly after the institutionalization of the ban on the ""natural philosophy"" books of Aristotle and his Arab commentators in 1210.  In 1212, Pope Innocent III, a friend from his student days, appointed Robert as Cardinal-priest of Santo Stefano, and he was commissioned on numerous missions as a papal legate.  An ardent opponent of usury, Courçon had written fervently against it in his incomplete Summa (c.1208) and preached for the implementation of its ban.  In 1213-15, he was the papal legate to a series of councils in Paris, Rheims, Rouen, Clermont and Bourges that implemented the ban on usury. In 1215, again as Papal legate, Robert de Courçon reviewed and renewed the ban on Aristotle at Paris.  He explicitly allowed the teaching of Aristotle's logical treatises and his Ethics under strictly controlled conditions, but banned the teaching of Metaphysics and all his natural philosophy works (Physics, etc.), including a ban on all summaries and commentaries on them.  He also set down degree requirements for students, requiring that a Master of Arts require six years of Artes studies and a minimum age of 21 and forbade anyone from lecturing on theology before the age of thirty-five, and at least five years study of theology.  Robert of Courçon attended the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215, and, on the route between Paris and Rome, visited numerous churches to preach zealously for the Fifth Crusade.  His activities in this regard were brought under suspicion, and he was later convicted of embezzlement of Crusader alms by the French church authorities, which required the active intervention of his old friend Innocent III to prevent it going any further.  In 1218, Robert of Courçon left on the Fifth Crusade as papal legate for Pope Honorius III.  He died at Damietta in 1219.

Antoine Augustin Cournot, 1801-1877.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/cournot.htm," French philosopher, mathematician and economist, Augustin Cournot has been rightly hailed as one of the greatest of the Proto-Marginalists.  The unique insights of his major economics work, Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth (1838) were without parallel.  Although neglected in his time, the impact of Cournot work on modern economics can hardly be overstated. Augustin Cournot was born in the small town of Gray (Haute-Saône, Franche-Comte).  He was educated at local schools until he was fifteen. Thereafter, for the next four years, he worked haphazardly as a clerk in a lawyer's office.  Cournot directed his own studies throughout this time, concentrating mostly on philosophy and law.  Inspired by the work of Laplace, Cournot realized that he had to learn mathematics if he was to pursue his philosophical aspirations.  So, at the relatively ripe age of nineteen, Cournot enrolled in a mathematical preparatory course at a school in Besançon.  He excelled at it and subsequently won entry into the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Paris in 1821.  As it happens, the ENS was closed down in 1822 for political reasons and so Cournot transferred to the Sorbonne.  He obtained a licentiate in mathematics in 1823.   During his student years in Paris, Cournot threw himself wholeheartedly into its stimulating intellectual and scientific atmosphere. He  attended seminars at the Academie des Sciences and the salon of the economist Joseph Droz. Among his main intellectual influences were Laplace and Lagrange.  Hachette, a former disciple of Condorcet, imbibed in him the principles of mathematique sociale, i.e. the idea that the social sciences, like the natural, could be dealt with mathematically.  Cournot counted the young mathematician Lejeune Dirichlet as a close friend. From 1823, Cournot was employed as a literary advisor to Marshal Gouvoin Saint Cyr and a tutor to his son.  For the next ten years, Cournot would remain in Paris in this leisurely capacity, pursuing his studies and research at his own pace and in his own way.  In 1829, Cournot acquired a doctorate in sciences, focusing on mechanics and astronomy.  After Saint Cyr's death in 1830, Cournot took it upon himself to edit and publish the remaining volumes of his late employer's memoirs.   Cournot's thesis and a few of his articles brought him to the attention of the mathematician Siméon-Denis Poisson who urged him to return to academia.  Cournot refused at first but, after his engagement with the Saint Cyr family ended in 1833, he took up a temporary appointment at the Academy in Paris.  It was during this time that he translated John Herschel's Astronomy (1834) and Dionysus Lardner's Mechanics (1835). In 1834, through the good offices of Poisson, Cournot found a permanent appointment as professor of analysis and mechanics at Lyons.   A year later, Poisson secured him a rectorship  at the Academy of Grenoble.  Although his duties were mostly administrative, Cournot excelled at them.  In 1838, (again, at the instigation of the loyal Poisson), Cournot was called to Paris as Inspecteur Général des Études.  In that same year, he was made a Knight of the Légion d'honneur (he was elevated to an Officer in 1845). In the same year he returned to Paris, Cournot published his economics masterpiece, the Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses (1838).  An outline of this treatise follows.  Cournot begins with some preliminary remarks on the role of mathematics applied to the social sciences.  He announces that his purpose in using mathematics is merely to guide his reasoning and illustrate his argument rather than lead to any numerical calculations.  He acknowledges (and disparages) N.F. Canard as his only predecessor.  In his first three chapters, Cournot runs through the definition of wealth, absolute vs. relative prices and the law of one price.   Then, in Chapter 4, he unveils his demand function. He writes it in general form as D = F(p).  He assumes that F(.) is continuous and takes it as an empirical proposition that the demand function is downward-sloping (the loi de débit, ""law of demand"").    It is important to note that Cournot's ""demand function"" is not a demand schedule in the modern sense.  His curve, D = F(p) merely summarizes the empirical relationship between price and quantity sold, rather than the conceptual relationship between price and the quantity sought by buyers. Cournot refuses to derive demand from any ""utility""-based theories of individual behavior.  As he notes, the ""accessory ideas of utility, scarcity, and suitability to the needs and enjoyments of mankind...are variable and by nature indeterminate, and consequently ill suited for the foundation of a scientific theory"" (Cournot, 1838: p.10).  He satisfies himself with merely acknowledging that the functional form of F(.) depends on ""the utility of the article, the nature of the services it can render or the enjoyments it can procure, on the habits and customs of the people, on the average wealth, and on the scale on which wealth is distributed."" (1838: p.47).  He proceeds to draw the demand curve in price-quantity space (Fig. 1).  He also introduces the idea of ""elasticity"" of demand, but does not write it down in a mathematical formula. In Chapter 5, Cournot jumps immediately into an analysis of monopoly.  Here, Cournot introduces the concept of a profit-maximizing producer.  He begins by positing a cost function  f(D) and discusses decreasing, constant and increasing costs to scale.  He shows, mathematically, how a producer will choose to produce at a quantity where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost (he re-expresses marginal cost as a function of price in its own right, f'(D(p)) = y(p)).  In Chapter 6, he examines the impact of various forms of taxes and bounties on price and quantity produced, as well as their impact on the income of  producers and consumers.    In Chapter 7, Cournot presents his famous ""duopoly"" model.  He sets up a mathematical model with two rival producers of a homogeneous product.  Each producer is conscious that his rival's quantity decision will also impact the price he faces and thus his profits.  Consequently, each producer chooses a quantity that maximizes his profits subject to the quantity reactions of his rival.   Cournot mathematically derives a deterministic solution as the quantities chosen by the rival producers are in accordance with each other's anticipated reactions.  Cournot showed how this equilibrium can be drawn as the intersection of two ""reaction curves"".  He depicts a stable and an unstable equilibrium in Figures 2 and 3 respectively.  Comparing solutions, Cournot notes that under duopoly, the price is lower and the total quantity produced greater than under monopoly. He runs with this insight, showing that as the number of producers increases, the quantity becomes greater and the price lower.   In Chapter 8, he introduces the case of unlimited competition, i.e. where the quantity of producers is so great that the entry or departure of a individual producer has a negligible effect on the total quantity produced.  He goes on to derive the prices and quantities in this ""perfectly competitive"" situation, in particular showing that, at the solution, price is equal to marginal cost.  In the remainder of his book, Cournot takes up what he calls the ""communication of markets"", or trade of a single good between regions.  In Ch. 10, he analyzes two isolated countries and one homogeneous product.  He shows that the impact of opening trade between the two countries leads to the equalization of prices, with the lower cost producer exporting to the higher cost country.  Cournot tries to prove that there are conditions where the opening of trade will lead to a decline in the quantity of the good and lower revenue.  He then proceeds to discuss the impact of import and export taxes and subsidies (and algebraic error here was spotted later by Edgeworth (1894)) .  On account of this, Cournot raises doubts in Chapter 12 about the ""gains from trade"" and defends the profitability of import duties.   Finally, Cournot acknowledges that the solutions obtained via his ""partial equilibrium"" method are incomplete.  He recognizes the need to take multiple markets into account and trying to solve for the general equilibrium, but ""this would surpass the powers of mathematical analysis"" (Cournot, 1838: p.127).  Cournot's 1838 work received hardly any response when it came out.  The denizens of the French Liberal School, who dominated the economics profession in France at the time, took no notice of it.  Cournot was left crushed and bitter.  In 1839, the sickly Poisson asked Cournot to represent him at the concours d'agrégation de mathématiques at the Conseil Royal.  After Poisson died in 1840, Cournot continued on at the Conseil as a deputy to Poisson's successor, the mathematician Louis Poinsot.   In 1841, Cournot published his lecture notes on analysis from Lyons, dedicating the resulting Traité to his long-time benefactor, Possion.   In 1843, Cournot made his first stab at probability theory in his brilliant Exposition.  He differentiated between three types of probabilities: objective, subjective and philosophical.  The former two follow their standard ontological  and epistemological definitions.  The third category refers to probabilities ""which depend mainly on the idea that we have of the simplicity of the laws of nature."" (1843: p.440) or what modern commentators would call ""credal probabilities"". After the 1848 Revolution, Cournot was appointed to the Commission des Hautes Études.  It was during this time that he wrote his first treatise on the philosophy of science (1851).  In 1854, he became rector of the Academy at Dijon.  However, by this time, Cournot's lifelong eye-sight problem began getting worse.  In 1859, Cournot wrote his Souvenirs, a haunting autobiographical memoir (published posthumously in 1913).  Cournot retired from teaching in 1862 and moved back to Paris. Despite the dark pessimism about the decline of his sight and his creative powers, Cournot wasn't quite yet finished.  He published two more philosophical treatises in 1861 and 1872 which sealed his fame in the French philosophy community.  But his reputation as an economist was lacking. Cournot took another stab with his Principes (1863), which, on the whole, was merely a  restatement of the 1838 Recherches  in more popular prose and without the mathematics.  Once again, it was completely neglected.  A Journal des économistes reviewer churlishly claimed that Cournot had ""not gone beyond Ricardo"", etc.  Cournot's resentment increased accordingly. However, by this time the Marginalist Revolution had already started.  Léon Walras (1874), who had read Cournot's work early on, argued that his own theory was but a multi-market generalization of Cournot's partial equilibrium model (indeed, the notation is almost identical).  W. Stanley Jevons, who had not read him, nonetheless hailed him as a predecessor in later editions of his Theory (1871).  Francis Ysidro Edgeworth (1881) went to Cournot to pick up his theory of perfect competition.  Alfred Marshall claimed to have read him as far back as 1868, and extensively acknowledged Cournot's influence in his 1890 textbook, particularly in his discussion of the theory of the firm.   Cournot lived long enough to greet the works of Walras and Jevons with a warm sense of vindication.  This is evident in Cournot's Revue sommaire (1877), a long, non-mathematical statement of his earlier work.  He seemed particularly grateful that Walras had bravely climbed the steps of the Institute de France and accused the academicians of injustice towards Cournot.  He died that same year.  Tired of the complaints by Walras, Jevons and other young blades, the French mathematician Joseph Bertrand took it upon himself to finally provide the first review of the Cournot's Recherches (jointly with a Walras book) in the Journal des savants in 1883.  It was not a kind review.  Bertrand argued that Cournot had reached the wrong conclusion on practically everything, and reworked Cournot's duopoly model with prices, rather than quantities, as the strategic variables -- and obtained the competitive solution immediately.  Edgeworth (1897) revisited the model and assailed both Cournot and Bertrand for obtaining deterministic solutions, arguing that the equilibrium solution in the case of a small number of producers should always be indeterminate. Cournot's Recherches were finally translated into English in 1898.  The introduction by Irving Fisher and Henry L. Moore's 1905 biographical pieces helped promote Cournot's work among Anglo-American economists.    The development of monopolistic competition in the 1930s drew much inspiration from Cournot's work (particularly after the ""re-discovery"" of Cournot's marginal revenue curve by R.F. Harrod).   Cournot's influence grew by leaps and bounds in the second half of the 20th Century.  As game theory advanced, Mayberry, Nash and Shubik (1953) restated Cournot's duopoly theory as  a non-cooperative game with quantities as strategic variables.  They showed that Cournot's solution was nothing other than its ""Nash equilibrium"" (Nash, 1951).  Cournot's influence on modern theory continues unabated, having been given a particular boost in the attempt to develop non-cooperative foundations for Walrasian general equilibrium theory (e.g. Novshek and Sonnenschein (1978) and the 1980 JET Symposium).

Leonard H. Courtney, 1832-1918.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/courtney.htm," British economist and Liberal politician. Born into a banking family and educated at St. John's College, Cambridge. Leonard Courtney was a follower of Bastiat and the French harmomist tradition. Courtney achieve the impressive rank of second wrangler at Cambridge in 1855.  Courtney competed unsuccessfully for the chair in political economy at Trinity College Dublin (losing to J.E. Cairnes) in 1861, and again at Cambridge (losing to Fawcett) in 1863.  But in 1872, Courtney had better luck, succeeding Cairnes as professor of political economy at University College London. In 1876, Courtney resigned from his position to pursue a political career.  He was succeeded by W. Stanley Jevons in his chair at UCL.  Courtney served as a Liberal MP in parliament from 1877, then in the Gladstone ministry from 1880 until 1884 (firstly, as under-secretary to the home department, then the colonial office, finally as financial secretary to the treasury).  He broke with Gladstone and resigned over the1884 Parliamentary Reform Bill.  Courtney continued in parliament, semi-attached to the Liberal Unionists,  until 1900, resigning over the Boer War. On a couple of side notes, Courtney was married to Catherine Potter (elder sister of Beatrice Webb).  Courtney is also one of several people to whom the famous phrase ""lies, damned lies and statistics"" is commonly attributed.      Major Works of Leonard Courtney   Resources on Leonard H.

A student of  Navarrus at Salamanca, Covarrubias y Leiva became professor of canon law there at a relatively young age.  Covarrubias y Leiva was a reformer of the university of Salamanca.  He was appointed titular Archbishop of Santo Domingo (Hispaniola) in 1549, but never ended up actually sailing to the Americas.  He resigned in 1560, taking up the local bishopric of Ciudad Rodrigo instead. He participated in the Council of Trent in 1562, and was afterwards made Bishop of Segovia (1564), a post he held until his death.. He served in the Council of State under Philip II of Spain, eventually rising to chancellor of Castile. Covarrubias y Leiva provided a somewhat explicit statement of a subjective theory of value: ""The value of an article does not depend on its essential nature but on the estimation of men, even if that estimation is foolish."" (1554).  He also authored a work on coinage (1562).      Major Works of Diego de Covarrubia y Leiva   Resources on Diego de Covarrubias y Leiva   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Alfred Cowles, 1891-1984,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/alfredcowles.htm," A prominent Colorado businessman, investment analyst and financial economist.  Alfred Cowles became convinced of the importance of the quantitative aspects of economics after the numerous forecasting failures of the 1929 crash. His own studies of stock market data, (esp. 1933), provide an early demonstration of the ""random walk"" in stock price movements and the beginning of the ""Efficient Market Hypothesis"".  In 1930, Alfred Cowles helped founded and funded the Econometric Society and its journal, Econometrica.  He served as treasurer and secretary of the Econometric Society throughout the 30s and 40s.    In 1932, Alfred Cowles set up the Cowles Commission for Economic Research at Colorado Springs (it later moved to Chicago and then Yale, where it was renamed the ""Cowles Foundation"").

John Craig, ?-? (fl. 1810-20),https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/craig.htm,"Scottish author, about whom virtually nothing is known.  All that is know of his background is that John Craig was from Glasgow, where he had studied under John Millar, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh  in 1818 and resigned in 1840.  John Craig was the author of two works somewhat critical of the Classical school.  Most interestingly, Craig disputed the classical distinction between value-in-use and value-in-exchange.  In particular, he argued that a fall in the exchange price of a good calls forth a new set of purchasers effectively bringing value-in-exchange down to the lower value-in-use of the new purchasers.  In this manner, Craig makes the link between an extensive form of marginal utility and value.    Furthermore, he noted, a rise in supply of a good may decrease the exchange-value of that good, but it will also (by an income effect) increase the demand and thus the exchange value of other goods.  He consequently concludes that ""value in use ... must be very accurately measured by value in exchange.""   Craig also erased Adam Smith's distinction between productive and unproductive labor, calling all labor ""productive"" if it, directly or indirectly, satisfies human wants. As he puts it, ""wealth may consist in whatever is the object of man's desire, and every employment that multiplies those objects of desire, or which adds to their property of yielding enjoyment is productive."" (Craig, 1814, II: 96).   Craig also denied the ""subsistence wage"" theory, arguing that it was not ""standards of living"" (or the price of necessities) that governs the setting of wages.  Rather, wages are determined by the demand for labor, which in turn is determined by the  ""capital from which wages are advanced [or] the demand for the produce of labor"" (1821: 37).  Thus, he holds a combination of both the Classical wages-fund doctrine and the Neoclassical theory of imputation.  Craig also disputed the Ricardian theory about the inverse relationship between wages and profits, noting that when profits are high, they call forth the application of more capital and that, by competition, raises wages. When profits are depressed, wages are low.  He regarded the theory of rent as a bit of a truism when the supply of land exactly matches demand, but if demand exceeds supply, then there is always a rent, even on the marginal land (Lands not brought for cultivation usually have some yield, like from the sale of its timber or renting out ""for sport"".) John Craig  is often regarded as one of the first British proto-marginalists.  Although he does align himself with J.B. Say, Craig makes note that he came across Say's works only after he had completed his own..       Major Works of John Craig   Resources on John Craig All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Richard Cumberland, 1631-1718.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/cumberland.htm," English theologian and early utilitarian philosopher. Richard Cumberland was born in London and educated in Cambridge (where he was associated with the 'Cambridge Platonist' movement), He moved into a clerical career and became Bishop of Peterborough in 1691. In 1672, Cumberland published his principal his principal tract, De legibus naturae.  It was crafted as a response to Thomas Hobbes's egoistic hedonism and legal positivism.   Cumberland defended the concept of 'natural law' and dismissed the need of a 'legislator' or 'power'.  The sentiments of pleasure and pain, prevalent in all animals, were evident, natural and powerful guides to individual and social conduct - teaching us, very directly, the consequences of actions, both practical and mystical (a mechanism of 'revelation' of morality directly to the 'soul'). While Cumberland argued that man always seeks pleasure and avoids pain, he disagreed that this ""pleasure"" was necessarily egoistic in a narrow sense.  Our greatest pleasure, he argued, can be found in benevolence - the raising of the happiness of fellow men.  In fact, he argued that as man is essentially both a social creature, as well as a rational one, then altruism is in his nature.  Cumberland's identifies ""Universal Benevolence"" as the ultimate foundation of all morality.  Moral virtue can be found simply by placing ourselves in 'harmony' with these sentiments. In identifying universal happiness as ""God's mandate"" and the 'fountain of virtue', that no action can be deemed moral unless it improves universal happiness, Cumberland can be rightly regarded as the father of English utilitaranism      Major Works of Richard Cumberland   Resources on Richard Cumberland   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

William Cunningham, 1849-1919. ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/cunningham.htm," Accomplished Scottish scholar, clergyman, economic historian and statistician. William Cunningham was born and raised in Edinburgh, Scotland.  His sickly disposition meant much of his time was spent in a family rural estate. In 1865, Cunningham enrolled at the University of Edinburgh, intent on a clerical career in the (free) Presbyterian church.  In 1868, Cunningham sojourned abroad, studying for a brief time at the University of Tübingen, then a bastion of the German Historical School.  Upon his return to Britain, Cunningham changed his plans, and (much to family disappointment) decided on a career in the (Episcopalian) Church of England.  William Cuningham enrolled in Casius College, Cambridge, studying moral sciences under Henry Sidgwick.  (Cunningham was also a pupil of Alfred Marshall, then only a few years older, who was a lecturer at St. John's at the time).  His main interest was philosophy, and he ended up writing a thesis on Descartes.  Lured by a scholarship, Cunningham transferred from Caius to Trinity College in 1872.  Later that year, he achieved a first (together with F.W. Maitland) in the Moral Sciences Tripos.  However, he was unable to secure a fellowship at a Cambridge college.  Partly as consolation, after his ordination as an Anglican priest in 1874, Cunningham was offered the title of vicar of Horningsea, just a few miles outside of Cambridge. As Cunningham would later confess to his daughter, economic history was not a subject he was very interested in.  His passion was for philosophy, but he stumbled on to economics, and then economic history, quite by accident.  For several years, while still hoping to find a chair in philosophy at another British university, Cunningham signed up as a Cambridge Extension Lecturer.  He ended up lecturing principally on political economy, but also history and literature, in various lecture tours in Yorkshire and Lancashire (Liverpool was his home base for three years)..  His travels through the industrial north, and interaction with working class audiences and parishioners (he often assisted at local churches), brought Cunningham into direct contact with the plight of industrial laborers and trade union movements, as well as the complaints and worries of industrialists about excessive competition.  It was here that Cunningham first got the impression that all was not well with British industrial capitalism and laissez faire.  In 1876, Cunningham married his first cousin, and they gave public cooking lessons together at various venues.  In late 1878, Cunningham was appointed assistant secretary to the Extension Syndicate, and moved permanently back to Cambridge.  Shortly after, he was appointed examiner in Cambridge University's History Tripos, and was saddled with the papers on economic history, which no one else seemed interested in. Cunningham quickly delved into the field.   Cunningham also dabbled in journalism on the side, serving as an occasional correspondent for The Guardian newspaper and contributing several book reviews to the Cambridge Review.  In 1881, Cunningham was appointed chaplain of Trinity College, Cambridge, and duly celebrated with a long winter's vacation to India.  Upon his return in 1882,  Cunningham decided to compose a textbook on English economic history.  The field was almost virgin territory in the English-language literature. The result was the Growth of English Industry and Commerce. It initially came out as a single volume in 1882, covering the span from the ancient Britons to the late 18th Century. Later editions were greatly expanded to include more detailed treatments of Mercantilism (a neglected literature, which Cunningham did much to revive) and encompassing 19th C. industrial developments.  As Cunningham would later confess, he bit off more than he expected - the lack of secondary literature led him to believe economic history could be briefly dealt with, only to find troves of untouched primary materials waiting for him.  The Growth duly grew in subsequent editions, and he produced several side-monographs (e.g. on usury, 1884) in the course of his research. The textbook was well-received, and in 1884, Cunningham was appointed university lecturer in history and economics.  That same year, Henry Fawcett died, opening up the vacancy of the Professorship of Political Economy at Cambridge.  Having just produced some well-regarded books, Cunningham fancied his chances and threw his hat into the ring, but the appointment ended up going to Alfred Marshall instead (although having fewer publications than Cunningham, Marshall had a better track record as a teacher).  In early 1885, Cunningham  attended the celebrated Industrial Remuneration Conference in London, bringing economists, businessmen and trade union leaders together, to mull over the matter of income distribution.  Cunningham reported back to Section F of the BAAS that quantitative economic arguments, while convincing to ""middle class intellects"", nonetheless  ""failed to make any impression on the minds of working men"" (p.12)   The problem, he insinuated, was with economics - in particular the tendency of economists to regard labor as a passive factor of production, rather than an active one, and ignoring it had concerns, like constancy of employment and working hours, that were not addressed by economics. Cunningham elaborated on his position more clearly in his Politics and Economics (1885), calling for a reconciliation between economic theory and historicism, to enable economics to regain its practical usefulness. Already suspicious of  laissez faire, which he blamed on the excessive dogmatic influence of utilitarianism (to which he was philosophically opposed), Cunningham still held out hope that economics could be re-cast in a more practical, socially-relevant form, compatible with Christian principles. It is here that Cunningham first outlines his nationalist Tory vision of economic policy, replacing the doctrines of free trade liberalism with what he calls ""National Husbandry"".  With a neo-mercantilist (one can almost say proto-fascist) tinge, Cunningham ranks the interests of ""the nation"" above both individual interests and class interests and criticizes current economic policy as narrowly self-interested, sacrificing future generations. He identifies the ""national interest"" only in broad ideological terms  (""making the future of our nation as great and noble as lies within our power"", p.273). National power subtly replaces the wealth or happiness of its citizens as the goal. He sees an active role for the State in fostering this (esp. via national monopolies), but notes that it must be conceived and implemented correctly, and that this requires a sensitivity to historical and social context rather than precise principles.  He reviews past economic policy, and condemns almost all of it.  He does not lay the blame squarely on economists - if anything, he believes economists have simply made themselves irrelevant and abdicated actual economic policy to narrow interest groups. A methodenstreit quickly developed between Cunningham and Marshall inside Cambridge,  Hving stumbled into economic history almost by accident, Cunningham was not, from the outset, as confrontational a historicist as Cliffe Leslie had been, but he was soon to take up the cudgels. Marshall's ascent to the chair, and his determination to make his kind of Neoclassical economics prevail on Cambridge, put him on a collision course with Cunningham.   Cunningham perceived Marshall's economics to be a restoration of the bad habits of the Ricardians - abstract out-of-touch theory, unabashed utilitarian ethics (now more explicit than ever) and free trade apologetics..  Cunningham took personal offense to Marshall's combative inaugural lecture, which acknowledged but dismissed the historicist challenge to economic theory.  But more grating was the fact that, ensconced in his new position, Marshall had supervisory authority over what Cunningham taught, and was determined to enforce it more readily than Fawcett had.  The faculty board sided with Marshall, and ordered Cunningham to teach at least one term of pure economic theory - the very theory Cunningham could not brook.  Cunningham only managed to rid himself of this obligation in 1888, when he resigned his university position to become a college lecturer in history and economics at Trinity. Cunningham was appointed Vicar of Great St. Mary's in 1887, a significant parish in rural Cambridgeshire.  Compounded with lectureship and chaplaincy at Trinity College, Cunningham was quite busy. Nonetheless, Cunningham was not yet prepared to surrender economics to Marshall.  In 1888, Cunningham made a bid for the Drummond Chair at Oxford, which would give him at least equal status (his bid failed, it went instead to Thorold Rogers).  Cunningham finally came out with guns blazing in a series of methodological articles in the Economic Review and the Economic Journal in 1891-92.  Cunningham finally left Cambridge in 1891 to to succeed Edgeworth as the Tooke Professor of Statistics at King's College London.  Cunningham held the Tooke chair until his resignation in 1897.  He taught briefly as a visiting professor at Harvard University in 1899, relieving Ashley.  He continued to serve as vicar of Great St. Mary's until 1908, when he was made Archdeacon of Ely, a post which he held until the end of his life. Cunningham was a vocal opponent of the nascent Neoclassical economics, particularly as propounded by his colleague, Alfred Marshall and the Cambridge School.  In economics, he sought to promote the historical method, making him one of the most leading advocates of the English Historical School.  Despite the sustained attacks levied by Cunningham, Marshall was sufficiently influenced by his pleas to try to include some more historical content in his work and operate more ""inductively"" in the derivation of his economic principles.  However, he refused to accept Cunningham's main charge -- that the validity of economic laws is conditional on historical, social and cultural context. Cunningham's opposition to Neoclassicism was not only one of method, but also of politics.  A vigorous neo-imperialist, Cunningham resurrected much interest in old Mercantilist thought.  He was deeply opposed to utilitarian philosophy and laissez-faire politics, and penned several tracts defending labor unions and protectionism.  He also contributed several tracts to the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge (SPCK).

Lauchlin B. Currie, 1902-1993,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/currie.htm," Canadian-US economist, government advisor and proto-Monetarist economist. Lauchlin Bernard Currie was born in Nova Scotia, Canada. He enrolled briefly at St Francis Xavier University, Nova Scotia, but finding its economic pickings scant, moved to England and enrolled at the  LSE.in 1922.  After graduating in 1925, Currie proceeded to pursue his Ph.D at Harvard university, producing a well-regarded thesis in 1931, which led to his celebrated 1934 treatise, considered a classic of early Monetarist thought.  Currie stayed on as a teacher at Harvard until 1934, when, failing to achieve tenure, Currie was drafted by Jacob Viner to join the US Treasury, taking up US citizenship in the process.   He proceeded to work as a researcher at the Federal Reserve Board.  In 1939, Lauchlin B. Currie was appointed as special economic advisor to US president Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  He served in that capacity for the duration of World War II.  He was involved with the Lend-Lease Program with China, personally leading important American missions to Chiang Kai-shek in 1941 and 1942.  He also led the American delegation to the Bern conference in 1945. Currie resigned from the government after 1945, and after a period as a private consultant, joined a World Bank mission to the Colombian government in 1949.  In the early 1950s, Currie was targeted by McCarthyites, and lost his US citizenship in 1954, thereafter moving permanently to Bogota,Colombia and taking up Colombian citizenship.

Joachim Georg Darjes, 1714-1791.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/darjes.htm," 18th C. German Lutheran theologian and Cameralist economist. Born in Gustrow (Duchy of Mecklenberg), Joachim Georg Darjes was trained in theology at the universities of Rostock and Jena, where he apparently came under the influence of Christian Wolff.  After earning his master's degree in 1735, Darjes switched to law, receiving his doctorate in 1739. Darjes was appointed as professor of moral and political philosophy at the University of Jena in 1744, and served as a counselor to the dukes of Saxe-Weimar and Eisenach.  Darjes remained at Jena until 1763, when he was invited by Frederick the Great of Prussia to take up a position at the University of Frankfurt-am-Oder. J.G. Darjes was a German Neo-Cameralist with a strong practical bent.  His major work, the Erste Gründe (1756), contained a clear distillation of Cameralist ideas. He is less concerned with outlining general principles and more in setting out specific practical guidelines for state economic administrators.  Although much of it is unoriginal, it is notable for, among other things, Darjes's clarification and organization of Cameralist ideas and for the defense of Cameralism as an academic subject worthy of inquiry.   It can be said that Darjes's book is responsible for bringing Cameralism into the classroom.       Major Works of Joachim Darjes   Resources on J.G. Darjes   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Hugh Dalton, 1887-1962.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/dalton.htm," British public finance economist and prominent Labour politician. Educated at Eton and then King's College, Cambridge, where he studied economics under the young John Maynard Keynes.  But Dalton found the appeal of socialism more entrancing and joined the Fabian Society at Cambridge in 1907.  Coming into the orbit of the Webbs, Dalton went on to continue his studies as the then-Fabian citadel of the LSE in 1911-13.  After serving in WWI on the Italian front,  Dalton finished his doctorate at the  LSE, and stayed on as lecturer.  His main contributions were in public finance. Dalton is perhaps most famous in economics for his 1920 article surveying various measurements of inequality.  As his premise, Dalton embraced Pigou's 1912 utilitarian idea total welfare as the sum of individuals welfare, with the additional assumption that everyone had the same concave utility curve.  On the basis of this, Dalton posited that a transfer of income or wealth from a rich man to a poor man that left the mean of a distribution unaffected (what is now known as a mean-preserving ""Pigou-Dalton transfer"") could be regarded as an unambiguous welfare improvement (""increase the sum of satisfaction"").  Dalton called this the ""principle of transfers"".  As a result, it might be possible to compare some income distributions with each other and judge them on welfare criterion.  Specifically, it possible to determine that a particular distribution represents a greater ""sum of satisfaction"" than another distribution, if one can (by a series of equalizing Pigou-Dalton transfers) reach one from the other.  Dalton compares various statistical measures of inequality which can capture this feature, proposing standard deviation and the Gini coefficient as perhaps the best (if still imperfect) measures. Hugh Dalton emerged as a prominent figure in the Labour Party, serving as Labour MP since his first election to parliament in 1924, and in the party's national executive council by 1925.  Dalton served briefly for a spell as a highly influential under-secretary of foreign affairs in Ramsay MacDonald's second Labour government (1929-31), but resigned when, in the depths of the Great Depression, MacDonald agreed to form a national coalition government with other parties.  The Labour Party suffered heavy losses in the 1931 election, and Dalton was among those who lost their parliamentary seats.  Dalton was a leading figure in the reconstruction of the Labour Party, helping it recover its losses in the 1935 election.  In 1936, Dalton finally resigned his academic posts in order to focus more fully on his new activity as chairman of the Labour Party in 1936. Dalton was the primary theorist behind the reorientation of the Labour Party at this time away from its gradualist approach, to a more ambitious nationalization program  (Dalton was reportedly much impressed by the merits of Soviet planning after a trip to Soviet Russia). Dalton had pressed for the need for national planning and massive wealth redistribution to handle unemployment and growth in a series of tracts in the 1930s, and finally won over when Labour Party adopted a (limited) nationalization program as part of its party platform in 1937.  He also pushed Labour away from its pacifist principles, urging it support confrontation with the Fascist regimes in Europe.  This was also made part of the party platform in 1937. During WWII, Hugh Dalton joined Winston Churchill's national unity government, serving as secretary of Economic Warfare from 1940 to 1942, with responsibility for managing the economic blockade of Nazi Germany, and then as President of the Board of Trade.  After the Labour Party under Clement Attlee rocketed to victory in the 1945 elections, Hugh Dalton was made Chancellor of the Exchequer, and presided over the transition of Britain from a war economy to the post-war welfare state.  Dalton was behind the Labour party's nationalization program, including the nationalization of the Bank of England, the establishment of the National Coal Board and the British Transportation Commission.   But Britain's postwar economy was weak.  After the sudden end of Lend-Lease, with Keynes's assistance, Labour secured a new American loan, but the money was quickly spent, and by mid-1947 Britain was in the throes of a foreign exchange crisis, for which Dalton was widely blamed.  Dalton was forced to resign in November 1947, when he was found to have leaked budget details to a journalist.  He remained in parliament until 1959, taking some minor cabinet posts in Labour governments along the way, but gradually lost much of his influence.  He continued to be regarded as an elder party statesman, but the intellectual force had shifted to a younger generation under Gaitskell and Crossland.  Dalton was raised to the peerage in 1960, and served briefly in the House of Lords until his death.      Major Works of High Dalton   Resources on Hugh Dalton   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

George H. Darwin, 1845-1912 ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/darwin.htm," Cambridge mathematician and astronomer, second son of famed naturalist Charles Darwin.  Educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, Darwin earned ""second wrangler"" in mathematics in 1868, and was promptly elected Fellow of Trinity.   Uncertain on what to do with himself, Darwin studied law for a while, and was called to the bar in 1874, but never practiced, preferring to focus on his academic pursuits, where his interests ranged widely.   Darwin struck up a friendship with marginalist revolutionary W. Stanley Jevons.  G.H. Darwin is principally known in economics for his 1875 article in the Fortnightly Review, defending the Jevonian theory against the criticisms of latter-day Classicals, notably Cairnes. Despite Jevons's attempts to lure him into economics, Darwin soon gravitated back to mathematics and science.  In 1883, Darwin was elected to the Plumian Chair in Astronomy and Experimental Science at the University of Cambridge.      Major Works of G.H.

Bernardo Davanzati, 1529-1606.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/davanzati.htm," 16th Century Florentine merchant and historian, Bernardo Davanzati is renowned for his translations of Tacitus and his strong opposition to the Reformation.  He was descended from the Bostichi, a powerful Guelf family of Florence. Bernardo Davanzati's 1582 account of the mechanism of ""bills of exchange"" was a classic depiction of the international exchange mechanism.  But it his 1588 discourse on coinage that Davanzati had his greatest performance. Davanzati distinguished ""value-in-exchange"" from ""value-in-use"", identifying the ""paradox of value"" in the process.  He noted that gold has no ""value-in-use"" but great ""value-in-exchange"".  This was because, he argued, the value of gold rests purely on what can be had in the useful things that are exchanged for it.  Commodities are ""valuable"" because of their use.  But gold is valuable because it can command commodities.   Davanzati also forwarded a ""metallist"" theory of money, arguing that coins circulate according to the value of their precious metal content.   He was perhaps the first to expound the ""choice-theoretic"" thesis on the origins of money, later made famous by Carl Menger.  Davanzati also noted that the degree of ""scarcity"" of precious metals affects its value relative to commodities -- thus we can regard Davanzati as one of the forefathers of the Quantity Theory of Money.  Davanzati's performance can be regarded as the true beginning of the ""Italian tradition"" in political economy.  A century later, Geminiano Montanari (1683) would restate the metallist thesis.  And a further century after that, Ferdinando Galiani (1751) would resurrect Davanzati's notion of ""use-value"" to begin the construction of a subjective theory of value.

Charles D'Avenant, 1656-1714.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/davenant.htm,"English Mercantilist writer. In 1685, Davenant was elected MP for St. Ives in James II's controversial parliament.  After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Davenant  lost not only his job on the excise commission, but also a substantial loan he had made to the crown.  Suddenly impoverished and unable to find successful employment in the new Williamite government, Davenant decided to advertise his expertise by publishing a 1695 tract on the financing of the War of the Grand Alliance that had raged since 1689.  Decrying debt as detrimental to trade and land taxes as inequitable in incidence, he advocated financing the war entirely on a balanced budget derived from excise taxation.  Davenant's tract did not go down well with the government, hitting out at every one of their new policies - the debt-financing annuities, the land tax reform, the Bank of England project, etc.  But it stood well with the opposition.  Later that year, he was commissioned by the Lords Justice to present his opinion on the project to remint the entire silver coinage of England.  Davenant's Memorial not only denounced the proposal as unwise, it also pointed out the necessity to return to a more Mercantilist trade policy. When the 'Junto Whigs' ministry took over in 1696, despite being the primary proponents of the recoinage Davenant had decried, they took on some of his proposals, like tightening the Navigation Acts and setting up a parliamentary Council of Trade.  In an effort to curry favor in the new regime, Davenant published his Memorial on Credit (1696), in which he moderated some of his earlier positions (esp. on debt) which the Junto seemed to have favored. Alas, it too failed to land him a job.  Davenant responded with his mean-spirited Essay on Public Virtue, a diatribe against the Junto Whigs and in support of the Tory leader Sidney Godolphin. In 1696, Davenant composed his essay on East India Trade, where he defended the ""unfavorable"" balance of trade between India to England as consistent with Mercantilist ""balance of trade"" doctrines when seen in the wider context, e.g. imports from India had an import-substituting effect against imports from other more expensive countries, or enabled re-export at greater value.  Davenant put the onus on critics to prove that a unfavorable balance with a particular country was also unfavorable for Britain's trade balance on the whole.  He engaged John Pollexfen, of the Board of Trade, in a very acrimonious pamphlet debate. Davenant's discourse coincided with the East India Company's own position, so his application for a job there should not have been surprising.  But that too came to nothing, even though Davenant floated his willingness to personally move to India himself. In 1697-8, as the war with France was winding down and the Junto Whigs were enveloped by scandals,  Davenant published a discourse in two parts, the first on tax revenues, announcing his adherence to Petty's ""political arithmetik"" (""the art of reasoning by figures of things relating to government"" (p.128)), reviewing the financial history (and scandals) of the previous years, crowing that his 1695 on the ills of debt-financing had been vindicated and proposing a means to pay the public debt back;  the second part restated, in a more careful form, the aggregative balance of trade doctrine of his East India essay. Davenant's 1699 Essay on Probable Means was meant as a follow-up to the East India discussion.  Following up on the ""political arithmetik"" of William Petty, Davenant sought to provide estimates of the national wealth of England as the real foundation of her trade. It is here that Davenant famously derived the first demand schedule.  Using data he claimed came from his friend Gregory King, Davenant traces the relationship between the price of wheat and the ""defect in the harvest"", tracing out thereby a demand curve. (see King-Davenant Law). Despite Davenant's arguments, the East India Company's monopoly was revoked and a rival EIC chartered in 1698 and imports from India restricted in 1699.  For his efforts, the (old) EIC offered him the job of ambassador to the Moghul Court.  Davenant accepted the post, but postponed his departure given that he had just been elected MP for Great Bedwin.  Once in parliament, Davenant sided openly with Harley's Tories, producing pamphlets on the Irish act of resumption and then, in 1701, against the Partition treaties over the Spanish succession and Whig jingoism, which he believed would rope England headlong into a war it could ill-afford, double the size of the public debt and increase the tax burden on the landed interests the Tories represented.  The Whigs, in turn, accused Davenant of being in the pay of France, which was not wholly inconceivable, given his financial straits (accentuated by the expenses of his son's appointment as consul in Frankfurt) and his suddenly close relationship with the French ambassador Poussin.  A brief scandal surrounded his being caught dining with Poussin on the same evening Anglo-French relations were snapped by Louis XIV's recognition of the Jacobite pretender James III.  This would cost him his parliamentary seat at the end of 1701. The scuttling of the Junto Whigs after Queen Anne's ascension in 1702 brightened Davenant's prospects.  Although he was not returned to parliament, he finally acquired, in 1703, a permanent government post as Inspector-General of Exports and Imports, a modest post but one which he imagined to turn into an economic policy vehicle.  Perhaps as a way of ingratiating himself with the new order, he produced his Essays (1704) in which, in contrast to his earlier rabid Toryism, he presented a defense of Anne's 'no-party' moderation against High Tory activism. In 1705, English pamphleteers had angrily turned their attention on the Dutch, allies of Britain in the War of Spanish Succession, but who nonetheless continued to trade with their common enemy, France.  The common refrain was that the Dutch were profiting from a war that was being carried out at English expense.  Davenant was sent on a fact-finding mission and produced a Memorial which, echoing the government's own position, concluded that this concern about the French-Dutch trade was much ado about nothing.  Davenant had less good things to say about the Dutch in his 1709 treatise on the Africa trade.  There he deployed his pen in the service of the restoration of the monopoly of the Royal African Company, claiming growing Dutch competition necessitated it. In 1710, the Godolphin ministry collapsed and the High Tories swept into parliament.  Unsurprisingly, Davenant changed his colors  quickly, pushing out pamphlets that denounced his earlier politics of moderation, debt-financing and the Dutch-French trade.  His two Reports to the Commissioners...on National Accounts (1712), chock-full of statistics, were in this line - the first geared to demonstrating the advantage to England of opening up trade with France, and the second to show the Dutch had been indeed profiting at English expense. D'Avenant died shortly after the Hanoverian succession.  Nearly all of Davenant's works were printed anonymously during his lifetime.  Many (but not all) were brought together in an edition of collected works edited by Charles Whitworth in 1771. The attribution of some anonymous works to Davenant have sometimes been contentious.      Major Works of Charles Davenant   Resources on Charles D'Avenant   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Herbert J. Davenport, 1861-1931.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/davenport.htm," Herbert Joseph Davenport, a rather unique specimen, served as the glue between two other highly original American thinkers: Thorstein Veblen, whom Davenport deified, and Frank H. Knight, who deified Davenport.   Born in Burlington, Vermont, Herbert J. Davenport studied at South Dakota, Harvard, Leipzig and Paris before finally obtaining his doctorate under Laughlin and Veblen at Chicago in 1898.  After a couple of years as a high school principal in Lincoln, Nebraska, Davenport took up an appointment at Chicago in 1900, working alongside his old masters.  After Veblen's departure in 1906, Daveport found the atmosphere at Chicago stultifying, and led him to take up an offer from the University of Missouri in 1908.  He finally settled down at Cornell University in 1916. Although accepting Veblen's work on the heterogeneous psychological underpinnings of economic behavior, Davenport nonetheless eschewed the Institutionalist approach.  Instead, Davenport articulated a curious mix of Austrian and Lausanne economics supported on Veblenian pillars. Davenport's approach was perhaps only shared by his Cornell colleague, Frank A. Fetter - who liked to group Veblen, himself and Davenport together into what he called the ""American Psychological School"". However, the true inheritor of Davenport was his student, Frank Knight, whose own peculiar brand of economics exhibits the Davenport stamp throughout. In Davenport's view, the Austrian theory of alternative cost was essentially correct, but the rest of the marginalist theory of value was based on faulty psychological underpinnings. There is not, in Davenport's view, a single, universal principle governing economic behavior - for lack of an alternative, marginal utility might do as an analytical device for a single individual, but one inevitably ends up in convoluted nonsense when trying to extend that across individuals into markets or societies. Furthermore, he resented the ethical implications often drawn out by contemporary economists in terms like ""maximum utility"", ""efficiency"", ""productivity"" and ""wealth"". Provocatively, Davenport considered all things which are produced and marketed, be they burgler's tools, murder weapons or obscene literature, to be ""wealth"" and activities such as pickpocketing, cheating and the slave trade to be ""productive"" (his examples!). Davenport rejected the tripartite division of factors of production - arguing that labor and land were produced means of production and thus shared the same features as ""capital"". Interest, however, was for him a monetary phenomenon and, in his view, financial imbalances were the precipitators of economic fluctuations. These fluctuations might also not be self-righting, and thus government intervention might be called for. Thus, as Knight would note later, ""Davenport was a forerunner of Keynes. In certain paragraphs, one cannot tell whether reading Keynes or not."" (Knight, 1942 as quoted in Patinkin, 1973). The central player in the economic field was, for Davenport, the entrepreneur, as is made evident in his most original work, Economics of Enterprise (1913). However, his contributions can also be traced out his hard-going 1896 textbook - which, for the time, was far more theoretical than most - and in his damning critiques of Classical and Neoclassical (esp. Marshall's) theory in his 1908 and 1935 books.  Not a man to pull his punches, Davenport's sardonic language could out-Veblenize Veblen's own.  ""A bold fellow of Scottish descent, with style formed on Carlyle"", is how Alvin Johnson described him.      Major Works of Herbert J.

Rev. David Davies, ? - c.1819.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/davies.htm,"English clergyman and empirical social scientist. Rev. David Davies was a rather obscure Anglican rural priest.  The particulars of his life are rather murky, little is know about him, other than that he graduated from Oxford and was a rector in the parish of Barkham (Berkshire).   He is primarily known for his empirical social study of the English rural poor in 1795. Fiscal concern over the Poor Laws had led Parliament in the 1780s to requisition reports from the counties and parishes of England on the poor rate revenues and expenses, but no reports on the actual condition of the laboring poor.  On his own, Rev. David Davies decided to also compile a survey of household budget accounts from poor families in his parish, which were published in the Easter of 1787.  He soon expanded his exercise, and, via friends, requested similar surveys from other parishes and counties in England, collecting some two or three surveys per county. The results were compiled by Rev. David Davies and published in 1795 as the The Case of Labourers in Husbandry in 1795.  in his empirical social study on the English rural poor in Davies was motivated by the alarming conditions of the working poor during the ""famine year"" of 1794-95, and contemporary debates over the provision of poor relief and rising poor rates. Davies's study was arguably the first major empirical work on the English poor, including arguably the first use of household surveys to gather data (Davies claims to have collected two or three surveys per county, via friends).  In this sense, Davies's study was more systematic that the Tours of Arthur Young (1768-71).  Davies estimates that poor households spent around 75% of their income on food.  Davies's study of 1795 was the first of the three great studies on the English poor of the 1790s. It precedes Frederick Morton Eden's State of the Poor (1797) and T.R. Malthus's Essay on Population (1798).  Although their data is not too dissimilar, e.g. they find that the great majority of the working poor (some four-fifths) do not earn enough to cover their expenses, they explain it differently. Unlike the latter two, Davies supported the Poor Laws and defended the right to relief, and blamed the pauperization of the working poor on general economic factors such as enclosures and unemployment.

David Davidson, 1854-1942.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/ddavidson.htm," David Davidson was one of the most prominent Swedish economists of the late 19th Century, building his base at University of Uppsala - where obtained his doctorate and then went on, in 1899, to become Sweden's first economics professor. In Uppsala, Davidson set up a new journal, Ekonomisk Tidskrift - later known as the Swedish Journal of Economics and still later as the Scandanavian Journal of Economics - which he edited almost singlehandedly in its early years and to which he contributed some 250 articles. With the journal, Davidson was arguably responsible for bringing economic theory to a Sweden previously dominated by German Historicism. Then, together with his rivals at Lund and Stockholm, Wicksell and Cassel respectively, Davidson took Swedish economics bursting onto the international scene. His dissertation (1878) which although highly Classical, was also remarkably Austrian in several ways, but it was with his History of the Theory of Rent (1880) where he was to stake a claim on the economics: as the first Neo-Ricardian. Davidson was to become one of the most prominent scholars on Ricardo - even though Davidson had thought Classical and Neoclassical theory could be reconciled. His scathing criticism of Cassel (1919) was not an attack on the latter's Neoclassicism, but rather on his dismissal of marginal utility theory as such. He was more reluctant to endorse the theory of marginal productivity, entering into a brief controversy with Wicksell, to whom he finally conceded. Another controversy with Wicksell was sparked over monetary theory - Davidson having developed a peculiar version of Ricardo's ""objective"" theory of money, although he was an opponent of the gold standard. Besides Hekscher, Davidson produced no students interested in his peculiar amalgam of Ricardian and Marginalist theory. Perhaps his most lasting legacy was his work on public finance, in particular his exhortation of a progressive income tax and various other aspects upon which the ""Swedish Model"" has been based.

Gerard Debreu, 1921-2004,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/debreu.htm," It is difficult to underestimate the luminous shadow cast by Gérard Debreu over Neo-Walrasian general equilibrium theory. For many years, Debreu has set the standard as well as posed most of the questions (and, in many cases, provided many of the solutions) that were to be addressed by mathematical economics - an achievement paralleled only by his intellectual brother-in-arms Kenneth J. Arrow. Debreu learnt his mathematics at the Bourbakist Ecole Normale Superieure and his economics from the works of Maurice Allais. He later became one of the most prominent and active inmates at the Cowles Commission before moving to Berkeley in 1962. Debreu's terse masterpiece, The Theory of Value (1959) remains the definitive statement of Neo-Walrasian theory in its purest, axiomatic form. Debreu's output may have been relatively sparse, but each one of his contributions have been prodigious. He independently discovered the proofs for the First and Second Welfare theorems (1951, 1954) and rigorously derived the conditions under which a utility function can represent a preference ordering (1954).  With K.J.Arrow, Debreu provided one of the first simple proofs of existence of a competitive equilibrium (1954). He also developed the first proof that the set of equilibria are finite and thus that equilibria are locally unique (1970). Equally fundamental, Debreu developed (with Herbert Scarf) the famous theorem on ""core convergence"" in a replicated economy (1962, 1963), provided tools for other more general core convergence theorems (e.g. 1967) and was one of the first to determine the rate of that convergence (1975). Debreu also opened many conceptual pathways for later researchers: he introduced the concept of a ""quasi-equilibrium"" (1962), the idea that a bundle of goods and their prices may be represented as a linear space and its dual (1954), integrated the concept of uncertainty into G.E. via state-contingent commodities (1959), developed the idea of ""neighoring agents"" as representable by the topology on a measure space (1969), defined the concept of ""smooth preferences"" which permitted the re-introduction of the differential calculus into mathematical economics (1972), as well as undertook the first venture into infinite-dimensional commodity spaces (1954). One of his better known pieces of work is that on market demand functions (1974), which yielded the famously destructive Debreu-Sonnenschein-Mantel theorem. The full depth and impact of his work is difficult to assess much less summarize adequately. A survey of some of Debreu's major achievements can be found in the linked survey of Walrasian General Equilibrium Theory.  The Nobel Prize committee referred to his entire life's work, with the Theory of Value (1959) underlined in particular, in awarding Gerard Debreu a Nobel Memorial Prize in 1983. He has taught at the University of California at Berkeley for most of his career.       Major Works of Gerard Debreu HET   Resources on Gerard Debreu   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Daniel Defoe, 1660-1731.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/defoe.htm," English writer Daniel Defoe is perhaps best known for his novels, Robinson Crusoe and Moll Flanders, but he was also the quintessential ""brilliant scoundrel"" of the Augustan Age. In rough chronological order, Daniel Defoe was a hosier, soldier, wine merchant, factory owner, bankrupt, spy, pamphleteer, convict, journalist, editor, political flunkey, hack writer and novelist.  In 1704, he launched the Review of the Affairs of France and of all Europe, one of the first serious political and economic newspapers in England (it folded in the aftermath of the 1712 Stamp Act).  He served as editor on several other newspapers later.  As a trader and non-conformist, Defoe's produced several political and social commentaries hailing the dawn of the bourgeois-capitalist age. In the service of Robert Harley, a shadowy figure of Queen Anne's reign, Defoe's produced a detailed three-volume (1724-7) account of the economic, political and social conditions of the cities and country-sides of Great Britain.  His talent was dissipated in later years when, as a political journalist, he compromised his independence as a reporter in return for political favors. Besides his descriptive tour, Defoe piped on several other economic issues.  Defoe authored a famous 1704 tract opposing a government scheme to erect workhouses for the unemployed poor, on the grounds that the output of the workhouses would reduced demand for the output of the currently employed, and thus simply shift unemployment around from one part of the country to another.  Defoe also authored a notable Mercantilist tract in 1728.      Major Works of Daniel Defoe   Resources on Daniel Defoe   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Gustavo Del Vecchio, 1883-1972,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/delvecchio.htm," Italian monetary economist. Gustavo del Vecchio was of Italian Jewish origin, hailing from the small town of Lugo in Romagna.  After his father's murder by a business associate in 1888, his family moved to Bologna, where Gustavo del Vecchio attended local schools.  Del Vecchio studied at La Sapienza in Rome (where he came under the influence of philosopher Antonio Labriola) and then at law faculty of the University of Bologna, from which he graduated in 1904, with a degree thesis on monopoly.  In Bologna, he had come under the influence of the doctrinally classical economist Tullio Martello.  He spent some time after as studying abroad in Berlin.  Gustavo del Vecchio developed a circulation theory of money, sometimes compared to Walras's lines, in a series of articles that appeared in the Giornale degli Economisti from 1909 to 1917, (later collected in his Ricerche, 1932).   After military service in WWI, Gustavo del Vecchio was appointed professor of political economy at Trieste in 1920.  In 1926, he obtained an appointment in economics and public finance at the University of Bologna.  In 1930, he also became rector of Bocconi University in Milan.  Del Vecchio was forced to resign from his academic positions in 1938 on account of the introduction of racial laws by the fascist regime. For a while, Del Vecchio worked as a freelance teacher of Jewish youngsters barred from formal schools.  Upon the German invasion in 1943, Del Vecchio fled to Switzerland, living in a refugee camp until 1945, when he returned to Italy and recovered his position at Bologna.  He worked for a while with the new Italian government to assist in the recovery from the war, and was partly responsible for the controversial 1947 monetary contraction under Einaudi to put a brake on post-war inflation. In 1948, he left Bologna to become the governor of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington DC, where he served for two years, then took up an appointment at La Sapienza in Rome, where he remained until his retirement in 1958..

Harold Demsetz, 1930-2019,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/demsetz.htm," American ""New Institutionalist"" economist. Educated at the University of Illinois and obtaining his Ph.D. at Northwestern in 1959, Demsetz was a professor at the University of  Chicago from 1963 to 1971, when he moved to UCLA, where he has been professor since.  Harold Demsetz was an early developer of R.H. Coase's theory of property rights. His 1967 paper argued that the allocation of property rights was a precondition for the efficient functioning of markets. Demsetz pursued these ""Chicago""-style concerns - i.e. locating the emergence of institutions such as property rights, contracts, firms, oligopolistic behavior etc. in transactions costs and information problems. Demsetz's 1972 paper with Alchian was one of the earliest analyses of the ""principal-agent"" problem.

Antoine-Louis-Claude Destutt de Tracy, 1754-1836.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/tracy.htm," The liberal French nobleman Destutt de Tracy was one the leading idéologues that sought to extend Enlightenment liberalism to post-Revolutionary France. He was, together with Say, the founder of the French Liberal School.   Destutt de Tracy's main work was the series Eléments d'idéologie (1801-1815) which followed up on the philosophy, psychology and economics of Condillac.  Like Condillac, Destutt de Tracy  sought to ground value in psychology, particularly utility.  He explicitly repudiated Adam Smith's cost theory of value (although he was sympathetic with much of the rest of his analysis).  Tracy's insistence that value must be measured in invariable units inspired Ricardo's search.  Destutt de Tracy's support for laissez-faire doctrines invoked the wrath of Napoleon Bonaparte.  Prevented from printing his Commentaires in 1806, Destutt de Tracy had to resort to asking the American president, Thomas Jefferson, to publish an English language version.  It was only published in France in 1819.  Jefferson also supervised the translation of Tracy's main economics treatise, the Traité de la volonté (Vol. 4 of the Eléments) into English in 1818, under the title Treatise on Political Economy.  It was reprinted in French in 1823 as Traité d'économie politique.  It was Tracy who originally coined the term ""ideology"", but he used it to denote the ""science of ideas"" in the sensorialist sense.  The term was given its negative slant by Napoleon and, later, Marx and Engels.      Major Works of A.L.C. Destutt de Tracy      Resources on A.L.C. Destutt de Tracy   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Davis R. Dewey, 1858- 1942.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/dewey.htm,"American ""new generation"" economist and statistician at M.I.T..  Originating from Burlington, Vermont, Davis Rich Dewey was the older brother of John Dewey, the famous American philosopher.  After obtaining his BA from the University of Vermont, enrolled for graduate school at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1883 to study economics and history. Davis R. Dewey was one of the first American graduates trained by Richard T. Ely and Henry Baxter Adams, the ""new generation"" historicists at Hopkins.    .Dewey worked as a journalist while undertaking his studies. He obtained his Ph.D. in 1886. Shortly after becoming president of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), general Francis A. Walker hired the freshly-minted D.R. Dewey in 1886 to teach the famous ""Course IX"" (""Course of General Studies"") at M.I.T.  Dewey ascended quickly, becoming formally full professor of economics and statistics in 1893.  Nonetheless, for several lengthy spells, Dewey was in fact the solitary teacher of economics, statistics and political science at MIT.  In 1907, Dewey was in charge of a department of ""economics and statistics"" at MIT, and would remain at the head of the department until 1933.  In 1913, Dewey launched the ""Course of Engineering Administration"" (Course XV), the kernel that would eventually evolve into MIT's Sloan School of Management in 1950. Always the empiricist first and foremost,  Davis Dewey was long-time secretary of the American Statistical Association (ASA), serving from 1886 to 1906.  Dewey was also the first managing editor of the AEA's  American Economic Review in 1911, a position he held for thirty years. (the Dewey medal, given to retiring AER editors, is named after him).

Antonio de Viti de Marco, 1858-1943,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/devitidemarco.htm," Italian public finance economist. Originating from Lecce, Apulia, Antonio de Viti de Marco was of noble extraction, an Italian marchese.  He studied law at La Sapienza in Rome, where he struck up a friendship with fellow student Maffaeo Pantaleoni.  After graduating in 1881, De Viti de Marco held posts at various universities (Macerata, Pavia), finally settling in 1897 as professor in economics and public finance at the University of Rome. De Viti de Marco was one of the founding editors of the new Giornale degli economisti (in its ""Roman"" series, from 1890). Antonio de Viti de Marco is perhaps best known for his 1888 treatise on public finance, which is considered a classic of the Italian ""Fiscalist"" school (later reworked and restated in 1923 and 1939).   Going beyond Ferrara,  De Viti De Marco attempted to apply ""pure"" Neoclassical economics to public finance. The essence of De Viti De Marco's approach was to regard that State as an economic actor who attempts to produce ""collective"" consumption goods at minimum cost.  He regarded taxes as the ""price"" of publicly-provided goods in a collective choice problem.  However,  he did not attempt to break the State's choices down to the choices of individuals in the nation.  That, he felt, was a question of politics.  As far as economics is concerned, de Viti de Marco argued, State fiscal activity must be regarded as a rational collective decision-making.  De Viti de Marco has also been credited with developing the ""Ricardian equivalence"" theory of public debt in an 1893 GdE article.  He was highly influential on Ugo Mazzola and Luigi Einaudi.  James Buchanan regards de Viti de Marco as an important anticipator of the Public Choice school.  A ardent proponent of laissez-faire and proportional taxation, De Viti de Marco was elected to the Italian parliament in 1900 for the Radical Party and railed against the protectionist policies of recent governments.  A staunch liberal, De Viti de Marco could not brook the rise of fascism and resigned his academic positions in 1931, rather than swear an oath of loyalty to the fascist regime.

Denis Diderot, 1713-1784  ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/diderot.htm," Leading French Enlightenement philosopher.  Denis Diderot (together with d'Alembert) was the editor of the great Encyclopédie project that was the hallmark of the Enlightenment age.  In economic matters, Diderot was initially sympathetic to the Physiocrats.  However, he soon switched over to Galiani's camp and became a staunch anti-Physiocrat.  Originally from Langres, the son of an artisan, Denis Diderot was educated in a local Jesuit school. Intending a clerical career, he enrolled at the University of Paris, residing in Collège d'Harcourt, a Jansenist stronghold. He abandoned his clerical aspirations and began studying law, but then abandoned those too in 1734 to become a writer.  Diderot soon fell in with young early Enlightenement thinkers such as Jean Jacques Rousseau.  He earned a side-living translating foreign works, such as Robert James's Dictionnaire de médecine in 1744. One of Diderot's anonymous treatises, In 1745, the Parisian publisher André Le Breton struck a deal with John Mills, an Englishman living in Paris, to translate Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia or an Universal Dictionary of arts and sciences, which had been published in England in 1728. Mills, however, procastinated, and a furious Le Breton fired Mills (and beat him with a cane).  When Le Breton relaunched the project with new partners in 1746,  it was adjusted to be not merely a straight translation of Chambers but rather a French ""adaptation"" of a universal dictionary of crafts and sciences from various sources. Le Breton hired the Abbé Gua de Malves as editor-in-chief, who brought on board several younger assistants, including the technically-gifted Jean le Rond d'Alembert, a very young Etienne Bonnot de Condillac and the experienced translator Denis Diderot.  However, when Gua de Malves quit the project in October 1747,  Le Breton offered d'Alembert and Diderot to lead the project themselves. Diderot threw himself into the project, undertaking research in the workshops of Paris, soliciting his friends as writers, purchasing engravings and hiring an illustrator, Groussier, to add more.  But Diderot's scrapes with the authorities nearly sunk the project.  A free-thinker, one of Diderot's anonymous treatises, Pensées philosophiques, was condemned by the Parlement of Paris in July 1746.  In 1749, his essay on blindness was proscribed, and this time Diderot was arrested and thrown into prison in Vincennes for several months.  Nonetheless, he was persuaded to continue with the project and in November 1750, Diderot and d'Alembert issued the final prospectus inviting subscriptions to the Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des métiers et des arts to be published by Le Breton in Paris.  It was originally envisaged as ten volumes with an additional two volumes of plate illustrations.   It would attract some 4,000 subscribers over the course of its publication.  In the end, the Encyclopédie (28 volumes in all) would cost subscribers some 1,000 livres (or £50 sterling then, or about US$11,000 today), affordable only to the well-to-do. (cheaper version would be later brought out by foreign publishers). The first volume (A to Azy) of the Encyclopédie came out in June 1751, with a ""Discours préliminaire"" authored by D'Alembert.  The Jesuits, who dominated education in France, took an immediate dislike to the Encyclopédie, and already in 1751, articles appeared in several publications (notably the Journal de Trévoux) accusing the Encyclopédie of plagiarism and attacking it for criticizing Jesuit teaching methods, denigrating saints and kings,  encouraging free-thinking and Deism and urging its proscription.   Diderot replied acerbically to some of his critics (notably the Jesuit writer Berthier). Voltaire, in a counter-article in the Siècle (December, 1751),  rose to the defense and praised the Encyclopédie.  The philosophes could not prevent the appointment of a royal censor, but the choice - Malesherbes - turned to be a person sympathetic with the project. The second volume (B to Ce) came out in February 1752, and this time landed it in hot soup. An article on ""Certainty"" by Abbé Jean-Martine des Prades caused a maelstorm (it was eventually condemned as heretical by the Sorbonne and the Archbishop of Paris in November).  In only a few days, the Jesuits secured a royal order from the Council of State formally suppressing the Encyclopédie.  What that meant in practice was not clear.  Prades and a few of the radical collaborators were exiled and publication is suspended.  But the sympathetic censor Malesherbes and the Madame de Pompadour, the king's powerful mistress, prevented the shut down of their offices and seizure of their papers. They insinuated Diderot and d'Alembert ought to continue working as if nothing had happened. The third volume (Cha to Cons)  came out discretely in November 1753, and contains a series of economic articles by the Neo-Colbertiste economist François Veron de Forbonnais.  But d'Alembert's article on schools (""Collège"") was highly critical of the Jesuit stranglehold on education, and provoked predictable protests.  The fourth volume (Cons to Diz) came out a year later (Oct 1754).  The fifth volume (Do to Es), which came out in November 1755, is preceded by an ""Éloge a Montesquieu"" by d'Alembert and includes the first articles contributed by Voltaire.  It also contains the entry ""Economie"" authored by  Jean-Jacques Rousseau (Rousseau's numerous other articles were confined to music). The sixth volume (""Et to Fn"", Nov 1756) contains the first known contributions of writers who would later become the Physiocrats - two articles by François Quesnay (his first writings), three articles by a very young Jacques Turgot, and an article by the Abbé Morellet. The venerable philosophe Voltaire contributed many articles to this volume, mostly related to literature and grammar. The Seventh volume (Fo to Gy) appeared in November 1757.  It again includes articles by Quesnay, Turgot and Morellet.  Once again Voltaire contributes many articles..  Montesquieu makes his first and only contribution to the Encyclopédie here, co-authoring an article with Voltaire on taste (""goût"").  The seventh volume was controversial, and turned out to be the last for a while. It was a spark in a tinderbox. A series of articles had already appeared over the summer of 1757 in the Mercure de France by conservative historian Jacob-Nicholas Moreau skewering the Encyclopédie, satirizing the contributors as a  little ""indian tribe"", suggesting the writers are a tight-knit clique conspiring to overthrow morality, religion and even the government.  Given the assassination attempt on Louis XV by an unemployed lackey, Francois Damiens in January 1757, this was not an idle comment.  Parts of the French press eagerly insinuated an association  between ""free thinking"" encyclopédisme and the attempted regicide.  The seventh volume did nothing to calm those fears. One of  Voltaire's articles (""Geneva"", co-authored with d'Alembert) provoked a vituperative protest from the government of the Geneva Republic  A French religious group, led by the Franciscan friar Hayer, read a ""Deist"" profession of faith in the volume, and began pumping out La Religion Vengée, a series of volumes with detailed criticism of the Encyclopedie. But it also had its supporters. The periodical Journal encyclopédique, founded by Pierre Rousseau in 1756, over the border in Liege, had as its principal function the defense of the Encyclopédie from critics and denunciation of censors. In May 1758, while the eighth volume was in preparation, the radical hedonistic philosopher Claude-Adrien Helvétius published his De l'ésprit.  It was a widely-read and instantly condemned.  Although Helvétius was not a contributor to the Encyclopédie, he was a personal friend of Diderot and other writers, and the authorities did not parse the difference.  In the fall of 1758, the Jansenist A.J. Chaumeix launched a long series of detailed attacks on both, conjoining the two.   The Parlement of Paris opened a session in January 1759 to examine subversive works, and Helvétius's work was formally banned and burned.  The Encyclopédie was also examined, and it only just escaped proscription.  But it was clear its days were numbered.  On March 8, 1759 the French crown revoked the publication of privileges of of the Encyclopédie of Diderot and d'Alembert, thereby suspending its publication.   Begun in 1751, only seven volumes had appeared so far, covering topics from A to G.  The suspension may have come about by the intervention of sympathizers, notably Pompadour and Malesherbes, as a means to remove the matter from the legal courts and avoid more serious consequences.   Malesherbes made it clear to the editors that the suspension would be enforced - that he would not tolerate its publication abroad.  In July, the French government issued a decree ordering the publisher to refund subscribers (but apparently no one took it up).   On September 3, 1759 Pope Clement XIII issued the encyclical ""Ut Primam"" [ch] condemning the Encyclopédie. The polemics having reach their height in 1759, would linger - Hayer's Society, Chaumeix and  Abbé Gauchat would continue pumping out anti-philosophe pamphlets, and in May, 1760, Palissot put on a farcical play skewering the philosophes at the Comédie Française.   Having had enough,  D'Alembert, resigned from the project in 1759. Turgot, who had only recently proposed to write many articles, also decided to quit (Neymark, p.47).  Diderot was left in sole charge.  In 1760, with the controversy dying down, Diderot announced that they would begin publication of ""plate volumes"" for the continuing Encyclopédie subscribers. These consist almost purely of illustrations (with text merely describing the pictures).  This was implicitly allowed by the censor Malesherbes.  Over the course of the next decade (from 1762 to 1772),  Diderot will arrange for the publication of eleven plate volumes in ten installments.  The appearance of the plate volumes was facilitated by the change of mood in France - the prosecution of the Jesuits by the Parlement in 1761 had stoked anti-religious feeling, raising it to a feverish pitch by 1762, and eliminated one of the Encyclopédie's most vocal enemies (the Jesuits were expelled from France in 1763).  Hayer, Chaumeix and Gauchat quietly wound up their polemical pamphlets in 1762.  The tide had turned.  A sober look at the controversy was provided by the Abbé Irailh in 1761 (v.4, p.118) and the volume put out by  Abbé Jean Saas in 1762 merely pointed out factual errors and mistakes (Saas's 1764 volume is a little more polemical).  As the plate volumes came out, the question of the written volumes resumed.  In 1762, the empress Catherine the Great of Russia invited Diderot to St. Petersburg, offering to allow him to continue publication of the text volumes there.  Diderot briefly considered it, but eventually turned it down.  Joseph of Austria (future Emperor Joseph II from 1765), an avid reader of the  Encyclopédie, also tenders an offer. The break finally came in December 1765, with the death of Louis Ferdinand, Dauphin of France and son and heir of Louis XV.  Louis Ferdinand had been the principle supporter of the conservative religious party in the royal court, and an intractable enemy of the the project.  Within days of his death, Diderot announced the publication of the remaining ten volumes (volume 8 through volume 17) of the text Encyclopédie.  Most appeared rather quickly in early 1766 (although stamped with a December 1765 date).  Diderot sidestepped the 1759 suspension (formally still in effect) with a careful rewording of the title, adding ""Mis en ordre par M. ***. A Neufchâtel, chez Samuel Fauche et Compagnie, libraires et imprimeurs"", insinuating the volumes were being published abroad.  The new royal censor Sartine (a friend of Diderot's) turned a blind eye and let it go forward.  The only wrinkle in the resumption was when publisher André Le Breton was arrested and briefly imprisoned for having dispatched copies of the remaining volumes to Versailles without permission.   There are few articles of interest written by economists in the remaining volumes. As noted, Turgot, who had planned several, never finished them. Voltaire contributed a bunch to volume 8, and it is sometimes suggested that Charles Dutot wrote the article on salt mines for volume 14. The journals of the day were largely quiet about the publication of the remaining volumes in 1766.  The only real polemical attempt was Maleville's 1766 attack on the ""Eclectique"" article, but it wasn't followed up.  The volumes passed largely unnoticed until Barruel's wider-ranging attack of the 1780s. Diderot's own contributions to the Encyclopédies included extensive articles on ancient philosophy. Diderot also wrote several novels and plays, and myriad of reviews of literature, art, etc.  After Diderot died in 1784, his library was purchased by Catherine the Great of Russia, and transported to the Hermitage palace in St. Petersburg.  It included some 34 manuscripts, including six previously unpublished (e.g. a refutation of Helvetius's De L'homme, an original essay on physiology and a detailed plan for a university in Russia)      Major Works of Denis Diderot       Resources on Denis Diderot   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Karl Diehl, 1864-1943.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/diehl.htm,"German economist, associated with the last generation of the German Historical School, at Freiburg. Originating from Frankfurt, Karl Diehl studied at the universities of Jena and Halle, studying economics under Johannes Conrad and coming under the influence of the Kantian legal philosopher Rudolf Stammler. After obtaining his doctorate in 1888, Diehl worked as a teacher in Vienna, while completing and completing his habilitation, which was submitted to Halle in 1890.

Diehl stayed on as a privat-dozent (assistant), and obtained the position of extraordinary (associate) professor at Halle in 1893. Diehl obtained the full professor chair at the University of Rostock in 1898, but stayed for only a year before taking the chair at Köningsberg in 1899. In 1908, Karl Diehl became professor at the University of Freiburg. Karl Diehl took an early but critical interest in the history of socialist economic thought.  Among his contributions was an extensive study of the anarchist leader Michel Proudhon (1888) and a supportive critique of Marx's theory of value (1898).  Diehl also undertook an extensive study of David Ricardo as an economic theorist (1905). Karl Diehl is also considered the founder and leader of the ""Social Law"" (Sozialrecht) school in Germany, a predecessor of the law-and-economics movement.  Inverting the Marxian formula, Diehl asserted the primacy of law in determining economic relations, that it is legal tradition that sets the views about contract and efficiency, which frames how the economy works.  As a result, Diehl believed economic ideas could and should be used to change and shape the law, to achieve the desired economic outcomes..

Carl Dietzel, 1829-1884.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/carldietzel.htm,"Carl (or Karl) August Dietzel was an early German Historical School economist and pioneer in public finance. Born in Hanau (Hessen),  Dietzel studied at the University of Heidelberg, obtaining his doctorate in 1853, and his habilitationin 1855 in political science (Staatswissenschaft).  Carl Dietzel was still a young 26-year-old when he published his 1855 masterpiece on public debt, System der Staatsanleihen. Attacking the then-popular ""crowding out"" theories of public debt,  Dietzel posited bond-financed government expenditures actually increased economic activity and ""crowded in"" private investment.   As such, Dietzel quixotically preferred to refer to government public debt as ""state credit"" (Staatscredit), After this sparkling beginning, Dietzel's output became more scarce.  After submitting his habilitation in 1855, Dietzel stayed on as privat-dozent  (assistant) at Heidelberg, moving to Bonn in 1858, and then back to Heidelberg again in 1861, becoming extraordinary (associate) professor there in 1863. In 1864, Dietzel took up a position in the polytechnical school of Karlsruhe (Baden). In 1867, Dietzel finally secured appointment as ordinary (full) professor at the University of Marburg, a position he held until his death. He also served as a deputy of the National-Liberal Part in the Prussian Parliament from 1868 to 1874.

Heinrich Dietzel, 1857-1935.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/dietzel.htm,"Heinrich Dietzel was a German economist at Bonn, one of the last generation of the German Historical School. Born in Leipzig, Saxony, Gottlob Heinrich Andreas Dietzel (no relation to Carl Dietzel) was raised in neighboring Altenburg.  In 1876, he enrolled to study jurisprudence and political science at the University of Heidelberg, and subsequently Berlin.  Heinrich Dietzel obtained his doctorate in law from Gotttingen in 1879.  After a short stint in the courts of Naumburg, Dietzel resumed his studies in Berlin in late 1880, studying economics under Adolph Wagner, and obtaining his philosophy doctorate in 1882.  He subsequently spent some time in Italy, researching agrarian policy.  While a privat-dozent in Berlin, Heinrich Dietzel reviewed Menger's methodological tract in a series of articles in 1884 for Conrad's Jahrbuch .   In 1885, Heinrich Dietzel became extraordinary (associate) professor in political economy at the German-speaking University of Dorpat (Russian Estonia),  He researched and wrote his work on German socialist Carl Rodbertus while in Dorpat. Dietzel was raised to ordinary (full) professor in 1887.  In 1890, Heinrich Dietzel was called back to Germany, to take up the chair in political science (Staatswissenschaft) at the University of Bonn, left vacant by the death to Erwin Nasse. Dietzel would hold the chair in Bonn until the end of his career. Heinrich Dietzel can be considered a member of the youngest German Historical School, but he was also quite distinct from them in several ways.  Although he was generally a historicist in his own approach, he was not a dogmatic soldier of the school.  Indeed, he held classical economic theory in high regard, and even defended the individualist methodology of the Austrian school during the methodenstreit,  On the other hand, he famously entered into polemics with Böhm-Bawerk over the marginalist revolution, believing classical and marginalist theories to be reconcilable.   In economic policy,  like many historicists, Heinrich Dietzel was an advocate of State-led economic development.  On the other hand, unlike many of them, Dietzel also disavowed protectionism and was an ardent defender of free trade , seeing it as an important tool for German development.   Dietzel was sympathetic to state socialism, and his biography of Rodbertus was near-hagiographic, but he had little patience for more militant socialists (notably Marxians).  As such Dietzel can be said to occupy a peculiar solitary position, a middle ground between the various German and Austrian schools of the time. Dietzel's most influential work is arguably his truncated 1895 treatise Theoretische Socialökonomik (only the first volume appeared). He tries to cut through the mess of political debates over economic organization and policy, by reducing it to two simple poles - the ""individualistic"" principle (Individualprincip) and the ""collective"" principle (Sozialprincip) – which provide the underlying ethical justification for social action. He recognized that both had the same goal of increasing welfare. The individualistic principle puts the welfare of the single being at the centre, the collective principle is concerned with the welfare of a larger community of people beyond the immediate concerns of the individuals within it. Importantly, the collective principle is not a ""State"" principle as the State cannot be an end in itself but promotes policies in the pursuit of either principle. Both principles are axiomatic in the sense that they are not 'provable' and either one can be used as the basis for social action. Although favoring the individual principle, Dietzel acknowledges it must sometimes give way to the collective principle, thus allowing room for State intervention. Curiously, he assigns communism to the individualistic camp, which takes to the logical conclusion some key liberal principles (for example, the abolition of inheritance because it is non-earned income) but without sharing liberalism’s scepticism of the State. Dietzel eschewed common terms like ""capitalism"" and ""socialism"", believing them to be vague and ideological. He also sought to remove the romanticist terms Volk and Nation out of the German terms for economics (""Volkswirtschaft"" and ""Nationalökonomie""), promoting instead the more neutral and ambivalent term ""Socialökonomie"". Heinrich Dietzel's pragmatic mix of liberalism and state intervention was influential on his students, and embraced by the wider public in Germany, particularly after WWI.  His student, Walter Eucken, and the future Ordo-liberals, would often cite Heinrich Dietzel as a predecessor.

Sir Dudley Digges, 1583-1639,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/digges.htm," English Mercantilist, educated at Christ's Church, Oxford, went to become a businessman, politician and diplomat.  An enthusiast of long-distance trade, Sir Dudley Digges was a director of the East India Company, an investor of the Virginia Company and  helped finance Henry Hudson's final trip to America in 1610.   Digges's 1615 Defence of Trade was a response to the recent attacks on the East India Company by an ""vknowne busie Person"" (Robert Kayll).  In particular, Digges insisted that the EIC had increased exports of English cloth, and that the ""losses"" to England's treasure by the importation of Indian spices and other goods were much exaggerated.  In 1618, Digges was appointed ambassador to Russia and later Holland.  Digges was elected to the 1626 Parliament and joined the Puritan MP Sir John Eliot in pushing for the impeachment of King James I's favorites, the Duke of Buckingham and Sir Francis Bacon, particularly on the subject of the dispensation of royal monopolies and corruption.  He continued his attacks in the 1629 Parliament of Charles I and Digges duly joined Eliot in his famous imprisonment.  But Digges was soon reconciled with the king and made master of the rolls.   In 1631, Digges was appointed to a royal commission to oversee the reorganization of the Virginia colony (the company had gone bankrupt a few years earlier).  His sons were Virginia colonists and one of them, Edward Digges, was even elected governor.  Digges's Compleat Ambassador, a posthumously-published tract, earned renown as a diplomat's handbook.       Major Works of Dudley Digges   Resources on Dudley Digges   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

He studied in his hometown and then at the university of Marburg and Leiden (the latter while a tutor accompanying a young prince).  Upon his return, he settled in Frankfurt am Oder, where he became a professor of history. After the ascension of of Frederick William I of Prussia, Justus Christoph Dithmar was appointed to one of the first two chairs in economics in Germany in 1727, taking up the title of professor of ""Kameral-Okonomie und Polizeiwissenschaft"" at the University of Frankfurt-am-Oder (Simon Gasser was appointed to the other chair at Halle).  Dithmar's lectures on cameralism were published in 1731.  It was quite successful, running through several editions.  Its partition of economic subjects under different headings was to remain customary in German universities for decades.  Dithmar also launched the Die Oeconomische Fama in 1729, regarded as the first German economics journal. Summaries and comments of the various historical dissertations supervised by Dithmar were published as a collection upon his death in 1737.

After a brilliant high school career in Algiers, François Divisia enrolled at the École polytechnique in 1910 and subsequently the École nationale des ponts et chaussées, where he came under the influence of Clément Colson.   Divisia interrupted his studies to serve in the French army during WWI.  He returned to the ENPC to compete his studies after the war, From 1919, Divisia worked primarily as a government engineer for the next decade, but eventually began to do some part-time work on economics.  His first economic work (1926) introduced the ""Divisia index""  applied to measure the monetary aggregates.  His 1928 treatise gave a more expansive view of Divisia's economics. In light of his contributions, Divisia was attached in 1930 to the French Ministry of National Education, and assigned to research and teaching posts.  He was a professor of economics at the ENPC from 1932 until 1950.  His 1962 work is considered a classic in econometrics.

Maurice H. Dobb, 1900-1976.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/dobb.htm," British Neo-Marxian economist, perhaps the single person most responsible for bringing Marxian economics into the modern day.  Maurice H. Dobb was educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge and taking his doctorate at the L.S.E., he became a lecturer at Cambridge in 1924, obtaining a fellowship from Trinity College in 1948. His early interest in Marxian economics yielded his 1925 dissertation, which tries to marry elements of Marxian and Marshallian economics.  Between 1925 and 1928, Dobb lived in the Soviet Union, and produced one of the first serious accounts of the transformation of the Russian economy under the Bolsheviks. In 1937, he produced one of his most famous works, Political Economy and Capitalism, helping update Marxian theory into a critique of  Neoclassical economic theory, which earlier Marxists had largely ignored, drawing particular attention and emphasis on the question of value theory. His 1946 exercise in Marxian economic history, examining the transition from feudalism to capitalism in careful detail, is one of his most accomplished historical works.   Soon after, Dobb began collaborating with Piero Sraffa in the long production of the collected works of David Ricardo.  In 1948 Dobb returned to the Soviet experience and produced one of the first detailed accounts of the Soviet planning debate, bringing him into the arena of development economics more generally, which he would continue pursuing parallel to his work on Marxian economic theory. Dobb's 1973 Marshall lectures at Cambridge on the history of economic thought is a landmark in the field, emphasizing the distinction between Classical and Neoclassical economic theory, focusing on the theories of value at their core, the common line that runs between Ricardo and Marx, and the great break that was the Marginalist Revolution.

Christian Wilhelm Dohm, 1751-1820,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/dohm.htm," German Cameralist, liberal and diplomat.  Originating from Lemgo (C of Lippe, Westphalia), Christian Wilhelm Dohm studied theology and law at Leipzig.   His early efforts to obtain substantive government positions came to naught, so Dohm picked up his pen and joined the Enlightenment's ""republic of letters"".  Like many philosophes, Dohm had a fascination with Asia, and his first books relate to European travels in Asia.  A critic of European colonialism and imperialism, Dohm's long term project was to prove that the origins of civilization emanated from India and China. In 1776, C.W. Dohm was appointed professor of finance and statistics at the Collegium Carolinum of Cassel (Hesse-Kassel).  Dohm was the founder (along with Heinrich Christian Boie) of the Deutsches Museum, published in Leipzig, which ran from 1776 to 1788.  In the first number of which Dohm presented a strong article calling for freedom of the press.  Dohm is said to have produced the German translation of Thomas Paine's Common Sense in 1777. In 1776, Dohm's colleague at Cassel, Jakob Mauvillon, published an essay on Physiocracy, inviting comments on the new economic system.  Dohm rose to the challenge, publishing a response in a 1778 article in Deutsches Museum (subsequently reprinted as a pamphlet, with an introduction by Sonnenfels).  Dohm was highly critical of Physiocrats, firstly casting doubt on the practicality of their policy schemes, before moving on to a direct critique of theoretical assumptions, laying out the several points of the doctrine.  Dohm, who had recently read Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, reiterates Smith's critique and articulates much the same objections to their land-obsessive theory.  Mauvillon composed a rejoinder to Dohm, defending Physiocracy in a series of letters (published in 1780). Dohm resigned from teaching in 1779 and joined the Prussian civil service, appointed as a royal archivist in Berlin.  It was shortly after this that Dohm published one of his most famous works, a 1781 tract boldly calling for the emancipation of the Jews in Germany (and elsewhere).  Apparently written at the request of Moses Mendelssohn, and addressed to the governments and rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, Dohm mounted a sober defense of the European Jewry against anti-Semitic accusations and prejudices, with a clear eye to emphasizing the practical political and economic benefits of emancipation. Rather than a passionate plea, Dohm's carefully arrayed arguments and measured tone were geared to seem reasonable and acceptable to German officialdom and public opinion (although a second 1783 edition, taking into account responses to the first, was more heated in tone and pulled fewer punches). Dohm's treatise was highly influential and helped ease Joseph II of Austria's 1782 tolerance decrees. Later commentators sometimes try to link Dohm's objection to Physiocracy with his defense of the Jews.  Dohm had a common underlying Cameralist outlook which recognized the importance of commerce and industry in economic growth and prosperity.  In the Physiocrat's obsession with land and dismissal of 'sterile' sectors, Dohm may have sensed traces of anti-Semitic prejudice, or perhaps just feared their doctrines might be deployed to reinforce them. Dohm subsequently rose to privy councillor to Frederick II the Great of Prussia in 1783. In the administration of Frederick William II, Dohm took up more diplomatic missions. He was the Prussian representative in Cologne from 1786 to 1796 and served as the Prussian representative to the congress of Rastatt in 1797.  In 1807, Dohm entered the service of Jérôme Bonaparte, King of Westphalia, retiring in 1810.

Evsey D. Domar, 1914-1997.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/domar.htm," Born in Lodz, Russian Poland, Evsey David Domar (initially surnamed ""Domashevitsky"") was raised in Harbin, Manchuria.  Evsey Domar emigrated to the United States in 1936. He obtained his MA in mathematics at Michigan in 1941, but subsequently switched to economics, proceeding to Harvard, where he studied under Alvin Hansen.  After earning his MA in economics, Domar served as a researcher at the Federal Reserve Board between 1943 and 1946, where he began putting out his first major publications.  Domar finally obtained his Ph.D.from Harvard in 1947.  After quick passages through Carnegie IT and Chicago (where he was associated with Cowles Commission in 1947-48), Domar joined the faculty of the Johns Hopkins University in 1948, and contributed to the resurgence in the old department over the next decade.  Domar moved to MIT in 1958, where he remained until his retirement in 1972. Evsey Domar has made contributions in three main areas of economics: economic growth, comparative economics and economic history. His work on economic growth began with his 1944 model on government debt, which considered how economic growth can lighten the burden of the government debt. His major claim to fame, however, was in developing, parallel to Harrod, the now- famous ""Harrod-Domar"" growth model (1946) as a way of extending the Keynesian demand-determined equilibrium into the long run.

Robert Dorfman, 1916-2002,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/dorfman.htm," Originating from New York City, Robert Dorfman studied at Columbia University, obtaining his BA in mathematical statistics in 1936 and an MA in economics in 1937. During WWII, Dorfman worked in statistics and operations research for the US government and the US Air Force. After the war, Dorfman returned to his studies, obtaining a Ph.D from UC Berkeley in 1950. He stayed on at Berkeley until 1955, when he finally moved to Harvard University, where would remain for the remainder of his career. Dorfman is perhaps most famous for the popularizing the use of linear programming in economics.  His famous 1958 book with Samuelson and Solow became an instant classic (affectionately known as ""DOSSO"").  Although Dorfman would later express reservations about the excessive mathematization of economics, he was nonetheless a critical spearhead of it, and was particularly gifted in its exposition, making it more accessible to economists generally, rather than the province of a small clique of specialists.

After completing his coursework c.1915, Douglas roamed around for a bit without a clear dissertation project.  He took up a variety of teaching positions, notably at Illinois, Reed College, Washington before finally landing a job in 1920 at the University of Chicago.  Douglas finally acquired his Ph.D from Columbia in 1921.  In 1923, Douglas spearheaded the (failed) attempt to get Thorstein Veblen elected to the presidency of the A.E.A.  In 1926, he launched another (failed) attempt to honor Veblen with a festschrift. Paul H. Douglas's primary quest was on the statistical testing of marginal productivity theory of distribution.  Douglas's attempt to estimate production functions led to his formulation, in 1928 ( together with the mathematician Charles W. Cobb) of the now famous ""Cobb-Douglas Production Function"".  His analysis of the modern Neoclassical theory of production and distribution is best expressed in his magnum opus, Theory of Wages (1934).  Douglas and his students undertook massive statistical examinations of the issue. Douglas left Chicago in 1942 to enlist as a private in the United States Marine Corps.  In 1948, Douglas was elected to the United States Senate for the state of Illinois.  He became one of the leading and most respected Democratic Senators.

Eugen K. Dühring, 1833-1921.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/duhring.htm,"\ 19th Century German lawyer, economist, scientist, mathematician, and philosopher - Eugen Dühring wrote on a surprising breadth of topics. Born in Berlin, to a family of Prussian officials, Eugen Dühring trained as a lawyer.  However, his career was quickly compromised when an affliction to his eyes led him to become nearly completely blind before the age of thirty.  Although he gave up his legal practice, Dühring continued on an academic track, and in 1863 complete his doctorate in philosophy and economics at the University of Berlin, and was promptly appointed to remain as a teacher there. Dühring taught at Berlin until 1877, when a dispute led to his resignation. A positivist philosopher,  Dühring believed in the natural harmonies of the classes, along the lines of the American Henry C. Carey. Like Carey, Dühring was heavily influenced by Friedrich List and combined external protectionism with internal free enterprise. Dühring was a proponent of socialist-style reform.to improve the lot workers.  He eschewed Social Darwinism, and saw competition as largely destructive.   A confirmed opitimist, Dühring believed that man's capacity and propensity for sympathy would overcome competition, and that mankind in the future would be organized in a network of egalitarian communes. Unfortunately, Dühring's work is overshadowed by his legacy as a promoter of virulent Anti-Semitic theories, most notorioiusly in his 1881 tract.   Dühring went beyond smug racial superiority, but also promoted the idea that Jews were dangerous and socially harmful, and that Jews and Jewish culture and ideas should entirely purged from German society. Dühring went so far as to deplore Christianity for introducing Jewish ""febrility"" into the Aryan mind, and urging the extirpation of of that too. Dühring's fame may ultimately rest on his being the target of the polemical 1878 tract by Friedrich Engels, Anti-Dühring    Although a socialist himself, Dühring deplored the First International under the leadership of Karl Marx, and deplored the Marxist theory of class struggle and  its confrontational strategy. The popularity of Dühring's works among some German socialists prompted Marx to set Engels on the task of addressing Dühring's philosophical system.  Engels broke down Dühring's theory point for point, contrasting it with the Marxian theory, especially on philosophical points like dialectical materialism.  As a result, Anti-Dühring emerged as a compact and convenient exposition and elaboration of Marxist philosophy itself, and became arguably the second most popular book of the Marxist canon (after the Communist Manifesto).

Charles Dumoulin, 1500-1556,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/dumoulin.htm," Charles Dumolin (also known as ""Molinaeus"") was  a prominent 16th C. French legal scholar, and a notable commentator and defender of customary law.  Charles Dumoulin's insistence on the supremacy of the monarchy over feudal lords and the church, and the constitutional basis of monarchical power, places him as the grandfather of Gallicanism, absolutism and natural law theories.  Charles Dumoulin was a Parisian native. After an initially brilliant career in courts and Parlement of Paris, Dumoulin converted to Protestantism in 1542 (first Calvinism, then after being condemned by the National Synod, Lutheranism, and then went on to his chase own peculiar mix of heresies). Fleeing from France, Dumoulin pursued a peripatetic lifestyle, teaching law at various European academies - Tubingen, Strasbourg, Dole and Besancon - for the next few years.  During his absence, his 1552 commentary on the edicts of Henry II was condemned by the Sorbonne.  In 1557, Dumoulin returned to Paris. But he was not yet out of trouble.  He was arrested and jailed by the Parlement of Paris in 1564 for his brief opposing the Council of Trent, where he declared it inadequate on legal grounds and subversive of both church traditions and royal power.    Dumoulin's interest in common laws and practices drove him to examine the matter of contracts and usury in his 1546 treatise. Dumoulin was the father of the ""autonomy doctrine"" of contract - that is, that the intentions of the contractors, rather than territoriality, governs the validity and consequences of the contract.  In his treatment of usury, Dumoulin demolished the Scholastic doctrine of interest, declaring credit productive and calling for the lifting of prohibitions.  Curiously, Dumoulin also articulated a theory of money which asserted that intrinsic value of coinage was an implicit international contract.

Charles F. Dunbar, 1830-1900.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/dunbar.htm,"  Charles F. Dunbar was the head of Harvard economics during the first quarter-century of its existence.  A self-trained economist of the Classical and apologist stripe, Dunbar's background was in Harvard Law. From 1856 to 1869, Dunbar was part-owner and editor of the Boston Daily Advertiser.  After two years of training in economics in Germany and England, Dunbar was appointed to the first separate chair of political economy at Harvard in 1871, replacing the controversial Francis Bowen.  Dunbar's courses relied primarily on classical texts, like Smith, J.S. Mill, Cairnes and Fawcett. Dunbar took on a wide variety of duties at Harvard, serving for a while as dean (1890-95).  Dunbar collaborated in President Eliot's man in his attempt to recast Harvard as a modern research university.  Dunbar's first research student was Stuart Wood, and he served as mentor to younger colleagues like Silas M. Macvane, J.L. Laughlin and Frank W. Taussig.   Dunbar was also the founding editor of the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 1886.   Schumpeter would later write dryly of Dunbar, ""And so, though not a great economist in the sense appropriate to this book, he was a great economist in the sight of God.""

Claude Dupin, 1686-1769,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/dupin.htm,"Claude Dupin was of bourgeois background, the son of a tax-collector  (receveur des tailles) in the modest town of Châteauroux  (central Loire valley). Claude Dupin was educated in the royal college of Blois, and went on to enlist in the army, rising to the rank of captain.  In 1714, Dupin inherited his father's post as receveur of Châteauroux.  Through his association with the powerful Parisian banker Samuel Bernard, whom he met in 1721, Claude Dupin rose swiftly in the French financial community, becoming receveur général of taxes in Alsace and Metz in 1724 and then entered the upper echelons as fermier général in 1726 and secretaire du roi in 1728.  Dupin would be eventually ennobled in 1749.   In 1722, still in the early days of his ascent, Claude Dupin married Samuel Bernard's illegitimate daughter, the storied Louise de Fontaine (Madame Dupin).  They soon purchased a fabulous estate at Chenonceaux on the Loire, where Madame Dupin regularly hosted some of the giants of the Enlightenment, including Montesquieu, Voltaire, Buffon, Diderot, Condillac and, most famously, Jean-Jacques Rousseau (who was also engaged as her secretary and tutor to their son, from 1745 to 1751).  Dupin himself had courteous relationships with the philosophes, even being asked to author an article in the Encyclopedie on the salt industry. Claude Dupin penned his first economics piece in 1742, a memoir on the liberalization of the grain trade for the minister Philibert Orry, inspired by Boisguilbert and, more importantly, his own observations.  But Dupin remained a Neo-Colbertiste, shying away from laissez-faire formula of his contemporaries Gournay and Herbert, advocating instead only a moderate and controlled liberalization. Dupin was persuaded to publish his memoir only in 1748. In the meantime, Dupin expanded upon his reflections in his major work, Oeconomiques (1745).  Privately printed in Karlsruhe to be distributed among friends and family, only about a dozen or so copies of this massive three-volume work ever existed   Nonetheless the substance of these volumes were printed under the different titles in 1747.  Great chunks of the work also appeared as entries in the finance volumes of the Encyclopédie Méthodique, which appeared in 1783-87 - the editor Rousselot de Surgy admitting (p.10) he relied greatly on Dupin's volumes. Dupin leapt into the public debate over Montesquieu's Spirit of the Laws, authoring two polemical treatises (1749, 1752) assaulting the work with particular violence.  Dupin was particularly incensed by Montesquieu's criticisms of the tax-farming system, of which Dupin himself was a leading specimen.   At the request of the Madame de Pompadour, Dupin suppressed the edition, with the result that only a few copies circulated.  Nonetheless, the loud debate over Montesqueieu's work in the Dupin household is said to have inspired Rousseau towards the development of his own system of political philosophy.

Charles Dupin, 1784-1873,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/charlesdupin.htm,
Pierre Samuel DuPont de Nemours, 1739-1817.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/dupont.htm," 18th C. French Physiocratic economist. Son of a Parisian watchmaker of Huguenot extraction, Pierre de Samuel Du Pont de Nemours was destined to pursue his father's craft.  However, at his mother's insistence, DuPont was given a sterling education, thus inclining him to pursue the more ""lofty"" calling of a man of letters.   However, his father would have none of that.  Upon his mother's death, DuPont was finally apprenticed to his father's workshop.  Dupont's neglect of the craft, his absenteeism, his continual escapades into Parisian salons, let to a violent confrontation with his father who, believing the young idler incorrigible, turned him out of his home.   Out on his own, DuPont took up his studies with a medical doctor, but finding himself unable to handle the traumatic decisions over life-and-death of patients, decided that medicine was not his calling.  Surprisingly, perhaps out of guilt, DuPont apprenticed himself to another horologist.  This time around, he worked much more assiduously -- a task made easier by his growing interest in mechanics.  In 1763, DuPont presented his father with a watch of his own design as a token of reconciliation -- and abandoned watch-making forever.    DuPont's new interest in mechanics had led him to contemplate pursuing a career in the Corps of army engineers.  It was while researching such a move, that he came across the works of their founder, Sebastien de Vauban.  Vauban's 1707 treatise calling for fiscal reform impressed the young DuPont and brought him into the realm of economics.   The 23-year-old DuPont de Nemours broke into print in 1763 with a critique of recent proposals to overhaul the French tax system.  He reminded reformers that the burden of a tax can be shifted around and that the people who are nominally the tax-payers are not necessarily the ones who actually pay the tax.  Although ignorant of Physiocratic doctrine, DuPont de Nemours argued that the burden of poll taxes on agricultural laborers ultimately fall on landlords.   DuPont suggested that the direct taxation of landowners would be the most efficient form of tax regime. DuPont de Nemours' early, independent performance impressed François Quesnay and the Marquis de Mirabeau -- who recognized in his proposals the echoes of their own theory.  DuPont was immediately recruited into the Physiocratic ""sect"" and shielded by the wing of the Madame de Pompadour.  DuPont de Nemours absorbed the works of the Physiocratic economists and would soon became one of their most eloquent popularizers.    In July, 1765, a business newspaper, the Gazette du Commerce founded by the Abbé Roubaud began publishing an annex of ""heavier"" theoretical and policy essays, entitled the Journal d'agriculture, du commerce et des finances.  In September, 1765, by the influence of well-wishers (probably Abbé Morellet and/or Trudaine), the young DuPont de Nemours was appointed as editor of the Journal. DuPont quickly transformed it into a bastion of Physiocratic doctrine. His most famous performance was his reply to a series of articles published in the Journal by the Abbé Baudeau.  DuPont de Nemours tore apart Baudeau's ""Neo-Colbertiste"" doctrines -- and, in the process, converted Baudeau himself to the Physiocratic cause.   However, having irritated too many people, DuPont was dismissed as editor in late 1766.  The unemployed DuPont was hired as a secretary by Jacques Turgot, then intendant of Limousin.  It was during this time that the 29-year-old DuPont de Nemours wrote and published his most famous book, La Physiocratie (1767), effectively an edition of Quesnay's works with his own commentaries.  Although there was little that was novel in it, it was notable for harmonizing and restating Physiocratic doctrine in a coherent, authoritative fashion (indeed, he refused to include Quesnay's own early works in it, as they were not ""sufficiently"" Physiocratic!)  It was here, incidentally, that the term ""physiocracy"" or ""rule of nature"" was first used.   DuPont de Nemours took particular care in explaining the social welfare implications of the Physiocratic policy positions, and insisting upon their universality of application.  His 1768 pamphlet, De l'origine, was an attempt to ""rewrite"" the history of Physiocratic school, to make it seem less ""sectarian"" and simply a continuation of earlier Enlightenment economists (particularly, Gournay).   In the meantime, DuPont's successor at the Journal, Veron de Forbonnais, had transformed the Journal into a conduit of anti-Physiocratic """"Neo-Colbertiste"" thought.  The Physiocrats, incensed at this transformation, realized they had to return to print and, in 1767, they rallied to Abbé Baudeau's journal, the Ephémérides du Citoyen.  In 1768, Baudeau passed the reins of the Ephémérides over to DuPont de Nemours.   Back at the editor's desk, DuPont de Nemours managed the Ephémérides for the next few years with his typical dogmatic zeal. In 1772, the Ephémérides were shut down by the government and DuPont was unemployed again.  The Margrave Charles Frederick of Baden immediately appointed him privy councillor of Baden and, for a couple of years, DuPont cooled his heels in Karlsruhe.  In June 1774, DuPont accepted an offer to go to Poland to serve as the tutor of Prince Czartoryski and head a committee on Polish education reform.  DuPont had already left for Poland when, in  August 1774, Jacques Turgot was appointed as controller general of France by the new king Louis XVI.  Turgot immediately asked his old assistant to join his administration.  After a little reflection, DuPont returned from Poland late that year and was made inspector-general of manufactures.  He distinguished himself particularly in municipal reforms. When Turgot was dismissed in 1776, DuPont went down with him.  He would later write an eulogy to Turgot and help edit his works. Although keeping his title and salary, DuPont was excluded from the post-Turgotian Necker administration and retired to his country estates. However, that did not stop DuPont from continuing to write and send memos to Necker, advising on economic policy (duly ignored).  DuPont's star got a brief lift during the Calonne administration.   The foreign minister, Charles Gravier, Count of Vergennes, as an associate and admirer of DuPont and included him in more active duties.  In 1782, DuPont was given significant responsibility during the negotiations of the Treaty of Paris with Great Britain, which ended up recognizing the independence of the American colonies.    It was here that DuPont made the acquaintance of several American statesmen and began an intimate correspondence with Thomas Jefferson. . To facilitate his negotiations with top-rank officials, DuPont de Nemours was raised to the rank of noble in late 1783 by the King Louis XVI. DuPont's private life suffered a tragedy in 1784, with the death of his wife, leaving him a single father with two sons,  Elethèure Irenée and Victor.  But DuPont just buried himself in work.  DuPont de Nemours stayed on with the Calonne administration in other capacities - notably as member of special agricultural and commercial boards, advising on economic policy, writing numerous reports and memoirs.   In 1786, DuPont was reportedly one of the chief negotiators of the commercial Eden Treaty with England, liberalizing trade between the two countries.  DuPont de Nemours was at least part of the brains behind Calonne's fiscal reforms, and he was appointed as secretary to the Assembly of Notables convened by Louis XVI in February 1787 to consider them.  But the notables condemned the reforms and ended up toppling Calonne by April.  The new government Loménie de Brienne tried to get rid of DuPont, and when that didn't work (too competent an economic expert to be dispensed with), Brienne diluted his official functions. After Brienne's own fall in August 1788, Necker returned to power, and kept DuPont on.  With the decision was made to call for the Estates-General, DuPont helped the preparations.  Nonetheless, DuPont de Nemours decided to resign as secretary and run for election as a delegate for the Third Estate of Nemours.  DuPont de Nemours participated in the Estates-General of 1789, and after the French Revolution broke out, continued on in the Constituent Assembly, where he aligned himself with the moderate party.  Outside of the Assembly, DuPont joined the liberal club, the ""Société of 1789"" formed by the Marquis de Condorcet (another intimate from the Turgot years), the Duke of La Rochefoucauld and the Abbé Sièyes.  DuPont published a slew of pamphlets and committee reports during the economic reforms of 1789-91.  Famously, DuPont was one of the prominent advocates of the disestablishment of the Catholic church and the seizure of Church property by the French government (this prevailed in November 1789).  On economic matters, DuPont's position was guided more by pragmatism than Physiocratic dogmatism.  He was particularly interested in maintaining public finances of the new republic viable.  He urged restraint in expanding government spending and abolishing taxes.  He did promote the replacement of the  dîme (10% tax on gross agricultural output) with the Physiocratic single tax on the net product, but urged the maintenance of other taxes and tariff duties to keep public revenues stable.  He was particularly loud in his opposition to non-interest-bearing assignats, carefully delineating their inflationary and deflationary effects, and urged redeemable or land-backed money.   He argued for the liberalization of the grain trade in principle, but also recommended that government exercise controls in emergency situations to fight against speculative pressures.   After the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, DuPont de Nemours returned to private life, and established a print shop and put his own newspaper, L'Historien. He continued pushing out policy pamphlets, albeit at a slower rate and more reflective.  He rose to the defense of the constitutional monarchy, notably personally organizing a wide petition, gathering 20,000 signatures in a few days, in defense of Louis XVI after the Tuilieries march of June 20, 1792. Dupont's shift towards monarchism alienated Condorcet, an avid republican.  While the two had collaborated closely on economic policy during the previous two years, they now drifted apart.  The elections of September 1792, the first under universal suffrage, purged the monarchists from their seats, and the French Republic was declared.  Expelled from the political world,  DuPont lost his remaining influence on policy.  As the Republic became radicalized,  DuPont's writings became more focused on the defense of individual liberties.  His consistent attacks on the Jacobins and the Terror made him a marked man, so, in in 1793, fearing for his life, DuPont de Nemours fled into hiding in the countryside.   He was arrested in July 1794, and incarcerated in La Force.  Only the death of Robespierre a few days later saved DuPont from certain execution.  He was released by September 1794, and returned to his country estates. During the Directory period, DuPont joined the upper chamber (Council of Ancients) of the new assembly in late 1795 as a representative for Loiret.  But it was a powerless position, and although he resumed writing, very little was on economics and mostly in political condemnations of the Directory (his 1796 Philosophie d'Univers, was a roaming collection of reflections on zoology, anatomy, etc.).  Proscribed after the coup of 18 Fructidor, DuPont de Nemours, urged on by his friend, Thomas Jefferson, departed for a brief period of exile in America, from 1799 to 1803.  The departure was not a sudden whim.  DuPont had long nurtured a hope to establish a new community run on Physiocratic principles, to demonstrate its viability.  The reports of his son Victor (who had served as a French consul in America in the 1780s), backed up by optimistic reports from his friend Thomas Jefferson, made America seem like a paradise of cheap land.  So, DuPont de Nemours packed up his sons and their families and set off in 1799, as pioneers.  Before leaving, DuPont had raised subscriptions from French investors for the establishment of a future French Physiocratic colony on the Kentucky frontier.  It turned out to be a disappointment - American land was not as cheap as advertised, and DuPont realized it was simply not financially viable.  Nonetheless, the DuPonts had to repay their investors, so they used what remained of their capital to set up a trading firm in New York City.  The new DuPont firm soon ran into financial trouble, when it contracted for supplies for the French military expedition to Haiti in 1802.   The expedition turned out to be a fiasco and Napoleon, infuriated, refused to honor any of its contracts.   With the DuPonts facing ruin, the elder DuPont decided to return back to France by himself, to plead for patience from his investors and use his political contacts to get Napoleon to change his mind.  He left the trading company in the hands of his eldest son, Elethèure Irenée.  Arriving back in Paris in 1803, DuPont - now in his sixties, and enjoying the familiar comforts of France - was not in a hurry to get back to America.    Elethèure Irenée, a chemist by training and not particularly inclined to the import-export trade, decided to wind up the New York trading company, and use the capital to establish a new gunpowder factory on the Brandywine River in Delaware.  It had considerably more success. The family business,  E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. of Wilmington, Delaware, is today better known as the multinational industrial-chemical giant, DuPont, the creator of familiar products like nylon, cellophane, freon, teflon, lycra etc.   In late 1803, DuPont de Nemours (senior) was offered to take up the directorship of the Banque Territoriale, a mortgage bank, but it failed shortly after when its notes were declared illegal.  Dupont subsequently busied himself as a  leading member and secretary of the Paris Chamber of Commerce, staying largely out of economic writings (save for a 1807 review of Malthus's essay on population).  Between 1808 and 1811, DuPont de Nemours was busy editing the collected works of Jacques Turgot,   He had put out the first two volumes earlier, in 1782 and 1788, now he revamped them, adding an additional seven volumes and notes of his own, including famous biographies of the old Physiocratic sect and their intellectual ancestors. After finishing Turgot, DuPont focused on re-writing and expanding a memorandum on education in America requested earlier by Jefferson. With the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1814, DuPont de Nemours was promptly made a councillor of state.  But the return of Napoleon, forced DuPont de Nemours to emigrate to the United States again, leaving Paris on March 20, 1815, the same day that Napoleon arrived in the city.  Although Napoleon's Hundred Days would soon be over, DuPont remained in the US to live out his final years.  DuPont de Nemours lived long enough to see the birth of the Classical school.  But, contrary to the insinuations of many Classicals (e.g. Adam Smith), DuPont de Nemours insisted that Classical theory was merely a continuation of the Physiocratic thought.  He laid out his views in his critique of Malthus's population theory and in a long letter to Jean-Baptiste Say, published together in 1817.      Major Works of P.S.

A. Jules E. Dupuit, 1804-1866.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/dupuit.htm," Arsène Jules Émile Juvénal Dupuit, often shortened simply to Jules Dupuit, was perhaps the most illustrious of the French engineer-economists.  Trained at the École des Ponts et Chaussées in Paris, Dupuit had a distinguished career as a civil engineer.  Starting out as chief engineer in the Sarthe region, Dupuit wrote several first-class theoretical and practical studies of road deterioration and maintenance (1837, 1842), for which he earned a Légion d'honneur in 1843.  His studies on flood management (1848), drawn from his experience in the Loire, also made a big impression.  Dupuit was called to Paris in 1850 and made chief engineer. It was here that Dupuit undertook studies of municipal water systems and hydraulics and supervised the construction of the Paris sewer system.  In 1855, he was named inspector general of the Corps des Ingénieurs and served on the Conseil des Ponts et Chaussées until his death.   Engineering questions led Jules Dupuit to his seminal contributions to economics.  Perhaps most famous is Jules Dupuit's 1844 article  in the Annales des ponts et chaussées  on the utility of public works, following up on an earlier 1830 work by Henri Navier.  In traditional engineering fashion, public works were often evaluated in terms of their costs to produce, and choice of projects ranked accordingly.  For example, if there are two possible routes to lay a road from Paris to Lille, then the route chosen will be the one that is cheaper to produce. However, while this might make sense for profit-oriented private projects, this was evidently unsatisfactory for public works, where the objective was not to benefit the builder, but rather to benefit the community at large. However, contemporary economics did not have tools available for measuring public benefits.  That is, cost-oriented classical economics gave an idea of how to quantify the benefits to the producer (i.e. profits), but the benefit to consumers (e.g. users of the road) seems subjective, or at least unquantifiable. This is what Dupuit set out to quantify. Dupuit followed up on the insight already provided by Navier: that the social benefits of a new road or canal can be deduced from the costs saved by users of that route.  Dupuit made two important corrections to Navier's analysis.  Firstly, he criticized Navier's narrow focus on transportation costs.  Dupuit noted that a new road might also open access to new sources of cheaper raw materials, which translates into lower manufacturing costs and thus lower prices of consumer goods. So Dupuit proposes that the proper measure of cost savings is the total reduction in production costs by users of the road (which include, but are not limited to, lower transportation costs).  Dupuit's second point was more revolutionary: Navier had recognized that cheaper transportation costs not only benefited existing traffic, but might induce an increased volume of traffic. Navier proposed to apply the same costs per unit saved by the old traffic to estimate the costs saved by the new traffic. Dupuit noted that this was an error that led to overestimation - as evidently the new traffic did not think it worthwhile to travel before, so they are not saving the same costs per unit as the old traffic.  From this kernel, Dupuit went onto construct his theory of consumers' surplus, demand and utility. Dupuit (1844) uses the example of a town that imports 10,000 tons of stone per year from far away as construction material (p.349).  If a new canal cheapens the cost of the stone imported by 5 francs, at first glance it seems the social benefit (what Dupuit calls ""utilité"") of the canal is 10,000 ×5 = 50,000 francs saved per year.  But Dupuit noted the volume of stone imported is not likely to remain that same, that with the new lower cost of stone, more construction projects will be undertaken that were not contemplated before, so the total volume imported will increase (in his example, from 10,000 to 30,000 tons). (p.352)  How do we measure the social benefit of this increase?   This is where Dupuit makes his breakthrough.  He recognizes that the increase implies that there are people who did not value the stone as worth importing when its cost was higher.  Consequently their benefit is not 5 francs saved per ton, but something less.  Evidently, their willingness to buy stone only at the lower price reflects a low ""strength of desire"" for the stone, whereas those consumers who were importing it before, when price was higher, must have a higher ""strength of desire"".  Dupuit consequently proposes to measure  the  ""strength of desire""  (""vivacité de ses désirs"") in terms of the price consumers are willing to pay (or as he states it, the price that will make a consumer ""renounce buying a good"").  As a mental exercise, Dupuit uses a varying tax to construct a demand curve - that is, calculates the incremental decline in purchases of stone that results from raising the price of stone by increments of 1 franc (p.352). He consequently proposes that the gain to consumers is the area under the demand curve, what Dupuit calls the ""utilité relatif"" (i.e. the consumers's surplus, the difference between what consumers are willing to pay and the price they actually pay).   The total benefit to consumers from the new canal is the sum of the cost savings made by the old importers  plus the estimated ""utilité relatif"" of the new importers.  He calls this sum the ""total relative utiility"" (""utilité totale relatif""). Dupuit thus shows how to estimate the benefit of a public project with his incremental method of calculating cost savings, and how the resulting number is much lower than Navier's naive application of the same cost savings across the board.  But Dupuit does not stop there. He uses this insight to launch a wider criticism of classical economics in general, and  Jean Baptiste Say in particular, for considering market price a measure of utility or value.  Dupuit's new method had shown that the real utility or use value of a product was not the exchange value, but the consumers' surplus.  So while utility and price are connected to each other, they are not the same as each other.  Dupuit elaborates on this in his 1853 article, where using the water-diamong paradox, Dupuit identifies value as being based on the combination of utility and scarcity, constructing marginal utility. He congratulates Say for having moved towards that insight, but chides him for abandoning it for cost of production theory, on the mistaken assumption that value measures utility anyway.  Dupuit went on to write a second paper, in 1849, applying his new theory on the optimal toll of a bridge.  He also contributed to the theory of monooply, price discrimination, marginal cost pricing and theory of industrial location.

Like many of the ""new generation"",  Durand took the obligatory academic tour in Germany, studying in Berlin under Adolf Wagner, before returning to the US to take up a job as assistant professor at Stanford University in California in 1898. Durand served as secretary of the US Industrial Commission (1900-1902), assembling the first team of policy economists to work in Washington DC.  Durand was at Johns Hopkins (?).  After the UCIS, Durand served briefly as an instructor at Harvard, before being appointed in 1903 to the US Census Bureau, and subsequently served on the US Board of Corporations from 1903 to 1909.

Émile Durkheim, 1858-1917,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/durkheim.htm," French sociologist, spiritual disciple of Auguste Comte and founder of Année Sociologique.  His 1893 book challenged the economist's idea that social harmony could arise directly from individual self-interest and free contract.  Durkheim showed how social differentiation from division of labor could nonetheless be consistent with social cohesion.  He introduced the notion of ""organic solidarity"" to explain this.  Contra Adam Smith, Durkheim saw the division of labor as the outcome of an evolutionary process, rather than a series of ""decisions"" (whose decision?) to make society more productive.  Contra Karl Marx, Durkheim emphasized the supremacy of social causes over economic ones.       Major Works of Émile Durkheim   Resources on Emile Durkheim   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Johann Eck, 1486-1543.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/eck.htm," German 16th C. Scholastic, Johannes Maier (known as Eck or Eccius as per his birthplace) was a German Augustinian theologian and professor at Ingolstadt (Bavaria).  Johann Eck is most famous as the antagonist of Martin Luther, having engaged with him in the disputation of Leipzig (1519), calling Luther out as a Hussite and accusing him of heresy.  Eck continued steadily pursuing Luther all the way to the Regensburg Council (1541). In economics, Eck's principle fame rests on being one of the first to call for the lifting of the prohibition on usury, a topic on which he won public disputations at Augsburg (1514) and Bologna (1515) and articulated into his Tractates, where he settled on the figure of 5% as lawful.  His defense of commercial capitalism has been often attributed to his close connection to the Augsburg merchant community, particularly the Fuggers.  Eck's fame as a defender of usury and capitalism may partly explain why Luther retained a rather traditional view on those topics.

Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, 1845-1926.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/edgeworth.htm,"  Francis Ysidro Edgeworth was a leading economist of the early English Neoclassical school,  a long-time Oxford professor and editor of the Economic Journal. Edgeworth's father, Francis Beaufort Edgeworth was a restless philosophy student at Cambridge on his way to Germany when he decided to elope with a teenage Catalonian refugee he met on the steps of the British Museum.  One of the outcomes of their marriage was Ysidro Francis Edgeworth (the name order was reversed later), who was destined to become one of the most brilliant and eccentric economists of the 19th Century.  Edgeworth was born in 1845 in Edgeworthstown, County Longford, Ireland into a large, well-connected and eccentric Anglo-Irish landowning family.  The famous novelist Maria Edgeworth, of Castle Rackrent fame, was his (elderly) aunt.  Although Edgeworth was the fifth son of a sixth son, all the other heirs eventually died, leaving him to inherit Edgeworthstown in 1911.  A lifelong bachelor (for a brief period, he hopelessly attempted to court Beatrice Potter), the Edgeworth line died out with him. Edgeworth was educated at Edgeworthstown by tutors until 1862, when he went on to study languages and the classics at Trinity College, Dublin.  He proceeded in 1867 to Oxford (initially at Exeter, then Magdalen and then, finally, from 1868, Balliol College).  He graduated in 1869 with a First in Literae Humaniores, but his degree was only awarded in 1873.   Around 1870, Edgeworth moved to Hempstead, in the environs of London.  Very little is known about the next decade of his life. Edgeworth subsisted on private income. He must certainly have studied law, for in 1877, he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple.   It is also presumed that he learnt mathematics and statistics on his own.  It is likely that his interest in this topic was ""inherited"" from his father's friend, William Rowan Hamilton, from his Oxford tutor, Benjamin Jowett, and from his close friendship with his Hempstead neighbor, William Stanley Jevons. In his first book, New and Old Methods of Ethics (1877), Edgeworth combined his interests, applying mathematics -- notably the calculus of variations and the method of Lagrangian multipliers -- to problems of utilitarian philosophy.  His main concern, following up on Sidgwick, was ""exact utilitarianism"", defined loosely as the optimal allocation of resources that maximized happiness of a society.  He argued that ultimately it falls upon the ""capacity for pleasure"" of people in a society.  He recognized that, under uncertainty,  ""equal capacity"" ought to be assumed.  However, he then went on to argue that certain classes of people ""obviously"" have a greater capacity for pleasure than others (e.g. men more than women), and thus some amount of inequality is justifiable on utilitarian principles. He struck a Darwinist note when, in an attempt to sound optimistic, he argued that ""capacities"" would evolve over time in a manner that the egalitarian solution would become justifiable in the future.  He resurrected his argument, and gave it a more frighteningly eugenicist tinge, in his 1879 paper. Although qualified as a barrister, Edgeworth did not practice law but rather fell into the academic underground of Victorian Britain for the next decade.  Edgeworth lectured on a wide variety of topics (Greek, English theatre, logic, moral sciences, etc.) in a wide variety of settings, from Bedford College for Women in London to Wren's private training school for Indian civil servants.  The pay was miserable and prestige non-existent.  A hopelessly impractical and deferential man, his applications for more permanent and lucrative positions at established academic institutions met with heartbreakingly little success.   He was giving evening lectures on logic at King's College, London when he published his most famous and original book, Mathematical Psychics (1881).   In it, he criticized Jevons's theory of barter exchange, showing that under a system of ""recontracting"" there will be, in fact, many solutions, an ""indeterminacy of contract"". Edgeworth's ""range of final settlements"" was later resurrected by Martin Shubik (1959) as the game-theoretic concept of ""the core"". Edgeworth also articulated what eventually became known as ""Edgeworth's conjecture"", namely that as the number of agents in an economy  increase, the degree of indeterminacy is reduced.  He argued that in the limit case of an infinite number of agents (""perfect competition""), contract becomes fully determinate and identical to the ""equilibrium"" of economists.  This proposition generated an enormous amount of interest during the 1960s and 1970s.  However, as situations of  ""perfect competition"" are not likely to be met in any society, Edgeworth had argued that the only way of resolving this indeterminacy of contract would be to appeal to the utilitarian principle of maximizing the sum of the utilities of traders over the range of final settlements.  Incidentally, it was in this 1881 book that Edgeworth introduced into economics the generalized utility function, U(x, y, z, ...), and drew the first ""indifference curve"".  Edgeworth's seminal work was given lukewarm reviews by W. Stanley Jevons (1881) and Alfred Marshall (1881).   Edgeworth attempted to reach out again to economists and others by restating his theory in a series of journal publications (e.g. 1884, 1889, 1891).  Marshall appropriated Edgeworth's result in his own Principles (1890) textbook, but his distortion of the idea led to a brief controversial exchange of notes in the Giornale degli Economisti in 1891.  Alas, it all to no avail. Marshall had successfully swept the entire matter under the rug, where it was to stay for much of the next eighty years.  Edgeworth's interests were changing anyway.  From 1883 onwards, Edgeworth began making his monumental contributions to probability theory and statistics. In his 1885 book Metretike, Edgeworth presented the application and interpretation of significance tests for the comparisions of means.  In a series of 1892 papers, Edgeworth examined methods of estimating correlation coefficients.  Among his many results was ""Edgeworth's Theorem"" giving the correlation coefficients of the multi-dimensional normal distribution.  For his efforts,  he was elected President of Section F of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1889 and later served as president of the Royal Statistical Society (1912 to 1914).   In 1888, on the strength of testimonials from friends and luminaries such as Jevons and Marshall, Edgeworth finally attained his first professional appointment, to the Tooke Chair in Economic Sciences and Statistics and King's College, London.  But that was only a stepping stone. In 1891, he was elected Drummond Professor and Fellow of All-Soul's College in Oxford, a much-craved position he would hold until retirement.    In 1891, he was also appointed the first editor of The Economic Journal, the main organ of the fledgling British Economic Association (what later became the Royal Economic Society).  This was a task he performed with remarkable diligence until 1911, when the post was assumed by John Maynard Keynes.  Edgeworth returned as joint editor in 1919, when Keynes had gotten too busy with other activities.  Edgeworth continued actively in this role until his death in 1926.   His interest in economic theory picked up again around this time.  In 1894, he published a survey of international trade theory in a series of articles in the Economic Journal.   In it, he pioneered the use of offer curves and community indifference curves to illustrate its main propositions, including the ""optimum tariff"".  In that same year, he engaged Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk in a brief controversy over the opportunity cost doctrine.   In 1897, he published a lengthy survey of taxation.   It was here that he articulated his famous ""taxation paradox"", i.e. that taxation of a good may actually result in a decrease in price.  His paradox was disbelieved by contemporaries, ""a slip of Mr Edgeworth"", as E.R.A. Seligman put it.  However, many years later, Harold Hotelling (1932) rigorously proved that Edgeworth had been correct.  Edgeworth also set the utilitarian foundations for highly progressive taxation, arguing that the optimal distribution of taxes should be such that ""the marginal disutility incurred by each taxpayer should be the same"" (Edgeworth, 1897).   It was also in 1897 when Edgeworth produced his Giornale article on monopoly pricing, where he criticized Cournot's exact solution to the duopoly problem with quantity adjustments as well as Bertrand's ""instantly competitive"" result in a duopoly model with price adjustment.  Instead, Edgeworth showed how price competition between two firms with capacity constraints and/or rising marginal cost curves resulted in indeterminacy.  For a modern statement of the ""Bertrand-Edgeworth"" duopoly model, see Levitan and Shubik (1972).  As a critic of the marginal productivity theory, Edgeworth's articles (1904, 1911) helped refine the Neoclassical theory of distribution on a sounder basis.  During the First World War, Edgeworth became particularly interested in questions of war finance.  His work in this, although highly original, were a bit too theoretical and did not achieve the practical influence he had hoped. Finally, as editor of the Economic Journal, Edgeworth often took upon himself the role of reviewing new books in economics.  He produced a prodigious amount of reviews, some of which have became classics on their own. Edgeworth's contributions to economics were stunning in their originality and depth.  But he was notoriously poor at expressing his ideas in a way that was understandable to most of his contemporaries.  Trained in languages and the classics, he habitually wrote (and spoke!) in long, intricate and erudite sentences, sprinkling them with numerous obscure classical and literary references.  He was in the habit of inventing words  (e.g. brachistopone = the ""curve of minimal work"") without bothering to define them clearly for readers who could not spot the Greek roots.   If his prose was taxing to read, his use of mathematics was even more negligent of his readers' abilities.  Having taught himself mathematics, Edgeworth must have assumed everyone else had done so as well. He did not bother to provide preliminary explanations of the techniques he was using.  Without warning, Edgeworth would glide breathlessly back and forth from his impenetrable prose to no less impenetrable mathematical notation and analysis.   A final point about his personality may be worth mentioning.  Many have accused Edgeworth of being excessively ""deferential"" to authority.  He certainly had many ""heroes"" upon whom he heaped high praise, such as Sidgwick, Jevons and Galton.  But he was also quick to wrap his words in velvet when handling opponents such as J. S. Nicholson, Charles Bastable, E.R.A. Seligman and Alfred Marshall.   However, this ""deferential"" aspect of his character may be due to the simple fact that Edgeworth was not a fighter by nature.  Perhaps the painful decades of professional insecurity contributed to this fear.   Although he was involved in several critical controversies (as was inevitable for such an original thinker), he would usually withdraw at the first sign of resistance or petulance on the part of his intellectual opponent.  His exit would usually be accompanied with a shower of flattery in the hope of avoiding any ill-feeling.  And many of his opponents were remarkably vicious.  Alfred Marshall, for instance, was a notoriously dirty scrapper and was not averse to intimidation in order to win a debate.  If Edgeworth ""exhalted [Marshall] to Achilles"" (as Schumpeter (1954: p.831) described it), it might be partly because he wanted to avoid incurring his wrath.   Nevertheless, at Oxford and the Royal Economic Society, Edgeworth was largely regarded as ""Marshall's man"" and, indeed, he often solicited Marshall's opinion on many of his decisions.  Whatever his motivations, it is true Edgeworth's professional activities contributed directly to the ascendancy of  the Marshallian Neoclassical hegemony and the decline of alternative approaches in Britain around the turn of the century.  He blocked Oxford appointments to ""undesirable""  heterodox scholars such as John A. Hobson.  For the Economic Journal, Edgeworth seemed to adopt the editorial policy of rejecting papers which strayed from Marshallian Neoclassicism in their analytical approach or threatened to strike up debates on method that might be uncomfortable to the Marshallian orthodoxy.  The work of Lausanne School economists, like Barone, were routinely rejected, as were those of the English Historical school.   In his own work and book reviews, Edgeworth defended the Marshallian position against the more radical Neoclassicals of the day.  Edgeworth himself never established a following and his work had little impact in Britain, with the possible exceptions of Arthur Bowley and W.E. Johnson.  Across the water, Edgeworth's work was respected by Irving Fisher, Knut Wicksell and Vilfredo Pareto, but most of his leads were not followed.   However, as the 20th Century progressed, Edgeworth's stock grew as Marshall's faded.  In the 1930s, some of his contributions were picked up by Paretians such as Harold Hotelling, John Hicks and Abba Lerner.  The 1960s and 1970s were characterized by the flowering of an ""Edgeworthian"" school, led by Martin Shubik, Herbert Scarf, Gérard Debreu, Robert Aumann, Werner Hildenbrand and other mathematical economists.

Luigi Einaudi, 1874-1961.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/einaudi.htm," Luigi Einaudi was a classically-trained public finance economist.   His major works were on public finance in the tradition of  Italian ""Fiscalist"" school (i.e. Ferrara, de Viti de Marco, etc.)  Einaudi was also an accomplished economic historian. In 1899, after graduating from law from Turin, Einaudi tried his hand at journalism.  He was on the staff of Turin's La Stampa and then, from 1903, on Milan's Corriere della Sera.  He was also the Italian correspondent for the liberal English weekly, The Economist.   In 1902, Einaudi became professor of finance at the University of Turin.  In 1904, he acquired a joint appointment at the Bocconi University in Milan.  From 1900 to 1935, Einaudi was the editor of La riforma sociale.  From 1936, he was editor of the Rivista di storia economica until 1943. An ardent advocate of laissez-faire and liberal democracy, Einaudi was elected to the Italian Senate in 1919.  With the rise of the Fascists in 1926, Einaudi stopped his journalistic activities.  He cast several important votes against the Mussolini regime, but became more engrossed in his academic pursuits.   Einaudi's most famous contribution is perhaps his 1929 thesis on the ""optimal tax"".  Einaudi argued that every particle of income should be taxed equally, but that standard income taxes fail in this regard as they ""tax"" savings twice -- first as income, and then on their yield as capital.  To avoid this ""double taxation"", Einaudi recommended the exemption of savings from the income tax base.     Einaudi was appointed rector of the University of Turin in 1943.  But, that same year, Einaudi went into exile in Switzerland.  He returned in 1945,  when he was appointed governor of the Bank of Italy.  He was elected to the Italian constituent assembly in 1946, and served in a variety of ministerial posts in the immediate post-war period.  From 1948 to 1955, Einaudi was the President of Italian Republic.  He deserves much credit for the creation of the post-war Italian ""social market economy"".

"Charles Ellet, Jr.", 1810-1862,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/ellet.htm," American civil engineer and economist.   Of modest Pennsylvania background, the largely self-educated Charles Ellet Jr went to France and attended the Ecole Nationale de Ponts et Chausees in Paris during 1830-2, where he absorbed the French engineering tradition. His remarkably original theoretical models of railway profit-maximization under monopoly, duopoly, etc., has led him to be hailed as the ""American Cournot"".   Ellet's most famous building structures are the suspension bridges in Philadelphia over the Schuylkill River and in Wheeling over the the Ohio River.

Richard T. Ely, 1854-1943.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/ely.htm," American ""New Generation"" historicist and forerunner of the American Institutionalist School. Considered by some as a German Historicist in American clothing, Richard T. Ely was the most prominent of the ""New Generation"" of German-trained American economists that emerged in the United States during the 1870s.  An outspoken proponent of the historical method, Ely's is regarded by some as the father (or grandfather) of the American Institutionalist School.  He was the teacher and mentor of both John R. Commons and Wesley C. Mitchell. Richard T. Ely was educated at Columbia, graduating in 1876, before going to Germany for graduate studies.  Ely spent three years at Heidelberg, obtaining his doctorate in 1879 under Karl Knies.  Upon his return to America, Richart T. Ely and fellow Heidelberg-trained historian Herbert Baxter Adams, joined the faculty of the Johns Hopkins University in 1881.  Founded in 1876, Johns Hopkins was the first American university to give ""earned"" graduate degrees in the German university model, and Ely and Adams would be responsible for leading the social sciences. Ely's efforts to transplant German Historicism into American academia led to a bitter methodological battle in 1880s with his conservative Hopkins colleague, Simon Newcomb (notably in the pages of Science magazine in 1886).  In an attempt to emulate Schmoller's Verein für Socialpolitik on American soil, Richard Ely was, with E;R;A Seligman and Henry C. Adams, the organizer and founder of the American Economic Association (AEA) in 1885. The AEA became quickly embroiled in the raging methodological controversy between old school conservatives and new school historicists.  The AEA eventually abandoned Ely's vision as a normative body for social progress to become a more staid professional organization.  The AEA still attaches Ely's name to its yearly distinguished lecture. Despite the polemics, President Gilman promoted Ely to associate professor at Johns Hopkins in 1887. Perhaps warned (or wary, after the 1886 Haymarket riot, of the popular association between socialism and violence), Ely reigned in his socialist leanings in his writings for a few years.  Nonetheless, Ely broke his restraint and resumed his advocacy of socialism in 1891. Reaping the whirlwind, Ely submitted his resignation from Hopkins in 1892.  He also resigned as secretary of the AEA that same year. In 1892, Richard T. Ely migrated to the ""progressive"" University of Wisconsin to head the School of Economic, Political Science and History.  He brought with him a coterie of Hopkins men, including Frederick Jackson Turner and John R. Commons.  It was under Ely that the empirical and labor bent long since associated with the University of Wisconsin was initiated.  It quickly became a breeding ground for the next generation of the American Institutionalist school.  Richard T. Ely's Outlines of Economics (1893) became an astoundingly popular textbook in American schools, and went through many editions with changing co-authors. Ely's position on labor movements and socialism eventually got him in trouble again. Just a few months after the Pullman strike in 1894, a state official accused Ely of spreading socialism and involvement in union activities in Madison.  This led to a controversial "" trial"" of Ely before the regents of the University of Wisconsin.  Although the Ely trial was managed by sympathizers, and led to a rallying of American scholars in defense of academic freedom in the United States, the resolution was a bit muffled. Ely was exonerated, but only after asserting that he did not hold the views ascribed to him and acknowledging that teaching such views in a classroom might be grounds for dismissal. Nonetheless, the Wisconsin Regents issued a famous stirring statement in defense of academic freedom/  Ely's work on labor movements abated slowly as Ely grew increasingly conservative in his later years.  His later work concentrated mostly on land economics.      Major works of Richard T. Ely HET   Resources on Richard T. Ely   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Henry C. Emery, 1872-1924,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/emery.htm," Son of prominent Maine judge, Henry Crosby Emery received his bachelor's degree at Bowdoin College in 1892 and a Ph.D. from Columbia in 1896. Henry C. Emery's 1896 well-researched institutional thesis on financial markets became the standard treatise on the subject.  Emery was the first to regard speculators as a specialized class of ""risk-bearers"" and defend speculative activity in secondary markets as a conduit for channeling ""information"" into prices and thus encouraging the efficient ""directing"" of resources.  His work was highly influential on Irving Fisher and J.M. Keynes.  On the strength of this impressive early performance, after a period of study in Berlin, H.C. Emery was hired by Yale University in 1900 to teach international trade (the first non-Yalie to join the faculty).  Emery left Yale to take up a position on the US Tariff Board from 1909 to 1913.  Emery resigned from Yale permanently in 1915 to take up a position with Guaranty Trust.  In 1917, Emery and his wife were on a mission to Russia when the Bolshevik Revolution broke out. He was arrested on his flight and held prisoner by the Germans until the end of the war.  Upon his release, Emery helped negotiate Guaranty Trust's relations with the fledgling Soviet government.  In 1920, Emery went on a mission to China.  He died on the voyage back home to America.      Major Works of Henry C. Emery     Resources on H.C. Emery All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Epicurus, 341-271 BC ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/epicurus.htm," Ancient Athenian hedonic philosopher, founder of the ""Epicurean School"".  Like many others, much of what we know about his doctrines comes from second-hand accounts.   The Epicureans posited the hedonic axiom that the ultimate Good was the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain.  However, unlike the Cyrenaics before them, the Epicureans emphasized pleasure and pain as mental conditions and thus (unlike bodily sensations) measurable against each other on the same continuum.  To emphasize this point, Epicurus differentiated between various sorts of pleasure, including ""moving pleasure"" (i.e. actively pleasurable experiences), and ""stable pleasure"" (i.e. absence of pain, tranquility).  He regarded the first as mere short-lived titillation and thus not quite on the same plane as the second.       Major Works of Epicurus     Resources on Epicurus   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Henry W. Farnam, 1853-1933,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/farnam.htm,"  American ""new generation"" historicist economist Henry W. Farnam had the luck of being born to a wealthy railway fortune.  But, in many ways, Yale and, indeed, economics itself, was luckier.  After taking his B.A. at Yale in 1874,  Farnam took one of the first ""earned"" M.A. degrees at Yale in 1876.  He then did the obligatory tour of Germany for further studies.  He acquired his Ph.D at the University of Strasbourg in 1878.    Upon his return, Henry W. Farnam was immediately appointed as lecturer in Latin at Yale College in 1878.  In 1880, Farnam was suddenly elevated as the first Professor of Political Economy at Yale College.  In 1881, he replaced F.A. Walker at Yale's Sheffield Scientific School.  Farnam's lectures at Yale College and Sheffield  specialized in public finance and labor organization.   Being independently wealthy, Farnam refused to collect his salary checks, and instead re-deposited them with Yale to be spent on Yale-related causes he deemed fit.  This included all sorts of overlooked good works, from building a social science library to refurbishing of dormitories to providing women's lavatories at the Yale Medical School.  One of his ""good causes"" was the aspiring economist Arthur T. Hadley.  Unable to get a salaried appointment on his own, Hadley's 1885 work on railways impressed Farnam, who subsequently ordered Yale to use his ""credit"" to pay for Hadley's salary as a lecturer in political science at Yale.  Farnam also financed the young Irving Fisher's construction of a hydro-static machine to illustrate the theory of general equilibrium.  Another of Farnam's ""good works"" was the creation of a house journal for the Yale social scientists.  In 1892, he bought the New Englander and Yale Review and re-launched it simply as The Yale Review, a journal for ""scientific discussion of economic, political and social questions.""   He served as its chief editor until 1911, when he closed it up in deference to the launching of the A.E.A.'s American Economic Review. Others outside Yale also benefited from Farnam's generosity.  The American Bureau of Industrial Research, founded in 1904 by Richard T. Ely and John R. Commons of Wisconsin, was initially funded by Farnam.  Farnam also acquired an appointment at the Carnegie Institution in Washington.        Major Works of Henry W.

Henry Fawcett, 1833-1884.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/fawcett.htm,"English Classical economist, and professor of economics at Cambridge University. Although blinded in a shooting accident with his father in 1857, at the age of 25, Fawcett nonetheless went on unabated.   A fellow of Trinity Hall,  Cambridge, and member of the Political Economy Club since 1861, Henry Fawcett carved out a reputation as a skilled debater.   A faithful enthusiast of John Stuart Mill, Henry Fawcett was one of the last Classical economists.   His 1863 Manual was a popularization of Mill's work, and was quite successful as a textbook.  That success, and the testimonials of numerous fellow economists from the Cub  (e.g. John Stuart Mill himself, W.T. Thornton, William Newmarch, Herman Merivale, G.W. Norman,  J.E. Thorold Rogers, among others), allowed Henry Fawcett to beat out stiff competition (H.D. Macleod, Leonard Courtney and J.B. Mayor) to be elected the  first permanent Professor of Political Economy at Cambridge University in November 1863, succeeding the long-serving George Pryme.  Fawcett would preside for two decades as professor at Cambridge, until his death in in 1884.  Economics was then part of the ""Moral Science Tripos"" (founded in 1848), which it shared with moral philosophy (taught by Sidgwick) and logic (or ""mental philosophy"").  By the terms of the professorship, Fawcett gave an annual series of lectures at Cambridge. Never quite the theorist, Fawcett considered theoretical matters essentially already settled by others (i.e. Mill), and preferred to focus his lectures on applied topics of the day. Some of the lectures would later emerge as published tracts.   . Fawcett's tenure at Cambridge was competent but unremarkable.  Fawcett was diligent in teaching ""pass"" students (who were compulsorily required to attend his lectures), but never bothered to cultivate disciples, or a school of followers, or enter into polemics with his colleagues. While professor, Fawcett found time to get elected to parliament, serving as a Liberal MP from 1864 to 1884.  He also served in the British cabinet as Postmaster General from 1880 to 1884.  He was renowned as a radical political leader and educational reformer.  After his death, Fawcett was succeeded in his Cambridge chair by the marginalist Alfred Marshall in 1884. It was Mill who introduced Henry Fawcett to Millicent Garrett. Despite a substantial age difference, it was an intellectual match and Henry and Millicent were married in 1867.  Millicent was vital in assisting blind Henry with his duties both as a member of parliament and as an economics professor.  Henry and Millicent's daughter, Philippa Fawcett, would go on to be come the first woman to top the Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge (in 1890).

Millicent Garrett Fawcett, 1847-1929.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/millicentfawcett.htm," English political reformer, economist, and wife of Cambridge professor Henry Fawcett. Millicent Garrett came from a relatively wealthy background, and was the younger sister of Elizabeth Garrett (Britain's first licensed female doctor).  While still in her teens, Millicent became interested in radical liberal politics, after hearing lectures by John Stuart Mill.  She became an enthusiast of Mill, and it was Mill who introduced her to Henry Fawcett, then an M.P and professor of economics at Cambridge.  Despite their age difference, it was an intellectual match, and Henry and Millicent were married in 1867.   Millicent Garrett Fawcett continued to be actively involved in politics and Women's Suffrage movement (she was elected as president of the not-so-militant National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in 1890, a post which she kept until 1914). Reasonably well-educated for the time, Millicent Fawcett also served the crucial role of secretary for her blind husband. Her most famous work is her 1870 Political Economy for Beginners, a brief but wildly successful book.  It set a contemporary record as a principles textbook for students: it ran through ten editions in 41 years. The success of her book was even more extraordinary given that it presented economic theory in a thoroughly Ricardian vein, then waning in Great Britain in the wake of the Marginalist Revolution.   Even more strikingly, Millicent Fawcett kept the classical wages-fund doctrine in the late editions of the text, despite being aware of its problems.  She went on to write a handful of more items on economic topics, culminating in a notable collection with Henry Fawcett (1872).  A vigorous promoter of education for women, she helped set up Newnham College for women at Cambridge in 1871.  Her daughter,  Philippa Fawcett, became the first woman to top the Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge in 1890, albeit she was not formally granted the title of 'Senior Wrangler'. After Henry Fawcett's early death, Millicent became more involved in political activities (e.g. she was appointed during the Boer War in 1901 to inquire into conditions in British concentration camps) and spent less time writing on economic subjects.  She was knighted (""damed"") in 1925.      Major works of Millicent Fawcett   Resources on the Fawcetts   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Grigorii A. Fel'dman, 1884-1958,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/feldman.htm,"Soviet Jewish electrical engineer and founder of Marxian economic growth theory.  Grigory Fel'dman worked at the Soviet Gosplan ministry from 1923 to 1931.  In 1928, Fel'dman introduced two-sector growth models to analyze the impact of growth on economic structure. Two theorems are attached to his name.  Fel'dman's first theorem relates the overall rate of economic growth to the relative size of the capital stocks in producer and consumer goods sectors.  Fel'dman's second theorem proposes that to maintain any given level of growth, investment must be allocated among sectors in the same proportion as the capital stock ratios.  Fel'dman was eventually purged by Stalin and shot.   Fel'dman's impact outside the Soviet Union was not insubstantial.  His work was highly influential on Adolph Lowe and the Kiel School.   There is indeed a formal equivalence between his work and that of the Indian planning economist P.C. Mahalanobis.  A very useful presentation of Fel'dman's work can be found in Domar (1957).

Adam Ferguson, 1723-1815.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/ferguson.htm," Scottish Enlightenment philosopher and historian, Adam Ferguson is widely regarded as one of the founding fathers of sociology.  Born in Perthshire, Scotland, Adam Ferguson was educated at St. Andrews and Edinburgh, where he quickly fell in with the circle of young academics that would form the core of the budding Scottish Enlightenment.  In 1745, after obtaining his license to preach in the Presbyterian Kirk of Scotland, Adam Ferguson was appointed chaplain to a Highlander regiment in the British army (42nd, the famous ""Black Watch"").  Ferguson joined the Highlander regiment in action in Flanders, and served in Europe until the end of the war in 1748. Ferguson remained attached to the regiment during their station in Ireland, until he resigned his commission in 1754.  Having repeatedly failed to find a position in a parish in Scotland, Ferguson abandoned his aspirations for the ministry in the Scottish church. Ferguson returned to Edinburgh and re-connected with his Enlightenment friends. Adam Ferguson succeeded David Hume in 1757 as librarian to the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh.  Ferguson held successive chairs at the University of Edinburgh, first in Natural Philosophy (1759), then in Moral Philosophy and Pneumatics (1764).  In 1767, Ferguson published his masterpiece, the Essay on Civil Society.  It was a ""natural"" history of the progress of mankind, along the lines that had been pursued by many Enlightenment philosophers, particularly David Hume.  Although Hume once claimed that Ferguson had ""more genius than the rest"", he disliked Ferguson's tract, regarding it as ""superficial"".   Eschewing speculation about the origins of human nature, Ferguson (1767) was particularly interesting in detailing its reality and consequences.  He deplored all talk of ""states of nature"" and other such artifices of social contract theory, arguing instead that:  ""Like the winds that we come we know not whence and blow whither soever they list, the forces of society are derived from an obscure and distant origin. They arise before the date of philosophy, from the instincts, not the speculations of men."" (Ferguson, 1767: Pt. 3.2).   Ferguson rejects the hedonic calculus of Hume, arguing that human behavior is driven not only by the peaceful pursuit of pleasure, but also -- indeed primarily -- by a will to power, aggressiveness, animosity and a instictive desire for conflict and a susceptibility to corruption.  ""To overawe, or intimidate, or, when we cannot persuade with reason, to resist with fortitude, are the occupations which give its most animating exercise, and its greatest triumphs, to a vigorous mind; and he who has never struggled with his fellow-creatures, is a stranger to half the sentiments of mankind."" (Ferguson, 1767: 1.4) Ferguson's purpose is to emphasize that no matter how universal human attributes and instincts may be, the outcome of social interaction is not uniformity and harmony but rather diversity and conflict.  The ""active man"" is Ferguson's main protagonist. As a result, he did not have patience for analyzing institutions and constitutions in terms of natural rights and laws. Human institutions, he argued, emerge spontaneously from human activity, and evolve in a variety of ways:   ""Every step and every movement of the multitude, even in what are termed enlightened ages, are made with equal blindness to the future; and nations stumble upon establishments, which are indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design.""(Ferguson, 1767: Pt. 3.2) This idea of ""spontaneous order"" arising from human interaction is echoed in modern evolutionary economics, particularly in the work of F.A. Hayek.   Among Ferguson's main contributions is the idea of division of labor leading to greater productivity.  As he notes: ""The artist finds, that the more he can confine his attention to a particular part of any work, his productions are the more perfect, and grow under his hands in the greater quantities. Every undertaker in manufacture finds, that the more he can subdivide the tasks of his workmen, and the more hands he can employ on separate articles, the more are his expences diminished, and his profits increased."" (Ferguson, 1767: Pt. 4.1) Indeed, the progress of society, Ferguson argued, was necessarily generated by the expansion of commerce which was, in turn, driven by the division of labor --  "" progress of commerce is but a continued subdivision of the mechanical arts."" (1767: Pt. 4.1).  This notion was highly influential on Adam Smith (1776).   However, Ferguson was not misty-eyed about the arrival of capitalism. Division of labor was, he argued, was necessarily accompanied by inequality -- ""In every commercial state, notwithstanding any pretension to equal rights, the exaltation of a few must depress the many."" (1767: Pt. 4.2).  Differences in status in the workplace generates differences in the community based on wealth which, Ferguson argued, extends to differences in power in political and social settings. Division of labor is also the cause of ignorance, alienation, misery and vices like envy and servility --  ""the beggar, who depends upon charity; the labourer, who toils that he may eat; the mechanic, whose art requires no exertion of genius, are degraded by the object they pursue, and by the means they employ to attain it."" (1767: 4.2). Fellow Scottish Enlightenment economists were lukewarm towards Ferguson's essay.  David Hume found its pessimism too dark, while Adam Smith suspected Ferguson had plagiarized his lecture notes.  But the Essay circulated widely and would serve as a catalyst for the budding Romantic movement. It was particularly well-received in Germany, where it would be applauded by Karl Marx.  In the 1770s, Ferguson took on the tutorship of the young Earl of Chesterfield and accompanied him on tours of the European continent. Ferguson took the chance to hobnob with the French philosophes.  His protracted absence from Edinburgh resulted in a legal challenge, but Ferguson successfully defended himself and returned to his university duties in 1775.  In 1778, he was appointed to a commission to mediate between the American colonies and the British government.  In 1783, he helped found the Royal Society of Edinburgh.  In that same year, he published his narrative history of Rome, covering the period immediately preceding that dealt with by Edward Gibbon.  Ferguson resigned from his chair in 1785 (succeeded by his student, Dugald Stewart).  Ferguson published his collected lectures  in 1792.  It is here that we find Ferguson's contributions to moral philosophy, mainly his idea of Stoical ""perfection"" and an attempt at reconciling all the different Scottish positions.

Francesco Ferrara, 1810-1900.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/ferrara.htm," Italian classical liberal economist. Sicilian economist, professor at Turin, politician and briefly Italian Minister of Finance. Francesco Ferrara  presented many of his ideas in the critical ""prefaces"" he authored to a series of Italian translations of the works of the classical economists published as the Biblioteca dell' Economisti in the 1850s.  He was an ardent believer in laissez-faire ""economic harmonies"" in the Manchester School sense, a supporter of the Cavourist liberal regime in Italy and an early free banking proponent.  Ferrara also promoted a utility-based theory of value, and so is sometimes also considered to be an important proto-Neoclassical.   Francesco Ferrara was a founder of the Società di economia politica in Turin in 1852.  He was also the principal force behind the formation of the Società Adamo Smith in Florence in 1874, in an effort to combat the rising influence of the historicist Lombard-Venetian School   Francesco Ferrara is also regarded as the progenitor of the Italian ""Fiscalist"" school.   Ferrara's conception of public finance examined the interface of the interrelationship between State fiscal policy and social interest.  He was highly influential on Maffeo Pantaleoni and, through him, de Viti de Marco.  James Buchanan has credited Ferrara as the ""grandfather"" of the Public Choice school.

Frank A. Fetter, 1863-1949.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/fetter.htm," American Neoclassical theorist. Born and raised rural Indiana, Frank A. Fetter enrolled at Indiana University, but interrupted his studies to help with the family bookstore business.  While working at the bookstore, Fetter came across the works of Henry George, and decided to turn to economics.  He re-enrolled at Indiana in 1890, where he came into the orbit of Jeremiah W. Jenks.  After completing his bachelor's degree in 1891, Jenks brought Fetter to Cornell on a fellowship for his M.A., then sent him off to Germany.  Fetter obtained his doctorate at Halle under Johannes Conrad in 1894.  Upon returning to the United States, Fetter was promptly appointed to the faculty at Cornell, before moving on as professor of economics at Indiana University.  Fetter remained at Indiana until 1898, when he moved to Stanford. Outraged by the Ross affair, Fetter resigned from Stanford in 1901, and was immediately picked up by Cornell, where he would remain for the next decade.  In 1912, Fetter moved to Princeton. A friend of Böhm-Bawerk and Wieser, Frank A. Fetter was the foremost advocate of the Austrian School in the United States. An avid opponent of Marshall and the Marshallian school (e.g. 1902), this Cornell and Princeton economist did his utmost to curb the latter's influence in the United States. Although his life's task was the rewriting of a unified theory of distribution which incorporated all factors under the Austrian conception of capital, Fetter also worked on various other topics - such as welfare and monopoly. Fetter liked to group himself together with Thorstein Veblen and Cornell colleague, Herbert J. Davenport as the ""American Psychological School"".  Convinced that Thorstein Veblen had effectively destroyed utilitarianism, Fetter appealed to the psychological idea of ""volition"" and ""subjective choice"" reminiscent of Pareto's approach without the hedonic pleasure-pain calculus. Subjective choice, however motivated, whether by rational calculation or instinctive impulses, led to valuation. His 1904 Principles sought to recast economic theory along the lines of his unique Veblenian-Austrian views.      Major works of Frank A.

Ludwig Feuerbach, 1804 - 1872 ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/feuerbach.htm,"   German philosopher, theologian and socialist. Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach was born into a scholarly family, his father having been a jurist and professor of criminal law at the Bavarian University of Landshut.  Raised in Munich, Feuerbach started off studying theology at Heidelberg, but subsequently switched to philosophy and transferred to the University of Berlin, where he came under the spell of the philosopher G.F.W. Hegel.  Feuerbach would go on to form, with Bruno Bauer, Karl Marx, and other Berlin students of Hegel, the core of the ""Young Hegelian"" movement. . Feuerbach returned to Bavaria to complete his studies, receiving his doctorate from the University of Erlangen 1828.  He submitted his habilitation thesis later that same year, and stayed on at Erlangen as a lecturer.  However, Feuerbach's first publication, an anonymous treatise on death and immortality (1830), was deemed irreligious and condemned.  In 1832 Feuerbach suspended his teaching, and retired to the rural village of Bruckberg (near Nuremberg), living off his wife's endowment in a porcelain factory, and writing mainly on theology. A 1834 tract of philosophy earned him an invitation to the Hegelian ""Critical Society"" and Feuerbrach would contribute several pieces to the Hegelian Jahrbuch in 1834 defending Hegel against critics (they would be reprinted as Anti-Hegel in 1835). Feuerbach would subsequently change tack, and contributed a series of articles to the Halle Jahrbuch in 1839 with would turn Hegelianism around. In his ground-breaking 1839 critique of Hegel's idealism, Ludwig Feueberbach became a proponent of a materialist (or at this point, 'naturalist') conception of history.  Feuerbach's work would become highly influential upon Karl Marx, who would take the reversal even further to dialectical materialism. Feuerbach's most famous work is probably his Essence of Christianity in 1841.  The ""essence"" of Christianity, according to Feuerbach (1841) was merely religious alienation.  Succinctly, Feuerbach argued that, as a result of difficult material circumstances throughout history, humans had gradually become alienated from their natural, subjective aspirations towards beauty, truth, wisdom, etc. and therefore created religion as the embodiment of these ideals.  However, once ""reified"" in religion, these ideals had come back to crush human aspirations entirely.  As a result, Feuerbach believed that religion had became the only obstacle to the realization of human ideals on earth.   A socialist society was only made possible by throwing out religion, thereby permitting humans to ""recapture"" their own ideals for themselves.   Feuerbach's thesis would lead to replies by Marx (1844, 1846) and Engels (1888).  Karl Marx criticized Feuerbach's thesis on the grounds that human projections of religious ideals were mirror images of the imperfections and misery of actual society.  Throwing out religion will accomplish nothing unless a socialist society is already in place.  Once material circumstances change and improve, Marx argued, the human ""need"" for religion would disappear.

Irving Fisher, 1867-1947.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/fisher.htm," American Neoclassical economist, and long-time professor of economics at Yale University. Irving Fisher was one of the earliest American Neoclassicals of unusual mathematical sophistication.  He made numerous important contributions to the Neoclassical Marginalist Revolution, of which the following are but a sample: (1) his contributions to the Walrasian theory of equilibrium price (he also invented the indifference curve device) in 1892;
(2) his volumes on the theory of capital and investment (1896, 1898, 1906, 1907, 1930) which brought the Austrian intertemporal theories into the English-speaking world, wherein he introduced the famous distinction between ""stocks"" and flows"", the Fisher Separation Theorem and the loanable funds theory of interest rates.
(3) his famous resurrection of the Quantity Theory of Money (1911, 1932, 1935);
(4) the theory of index numbers (1922);
(5) the Phillips Curve (1926)
(6) his debt-deflation theory (1933) which is echoed in Post Keynesian economics. Irving Fisher was born in Saugerties, in the Hudson valley of New York.  He studied at Yale University, obtaining his B.A. in 1888 and his Ph.D. in 1891.  For his dissertation, published in 1892,  Fisher constructed a remarkable machine equipped with pumps, wheels, levers and pipes in order to illustrate his price theory [see pictures of his draft and his first and second prototypes].   From 1890, Fisher was a mathematics tutor at Yale.  After Sumner's abrupt leave in 1891, Fisher was slated to teach a course on the ""Mathematical Theory of Price"".  In 1893, Fisher was appointed assistant professor of mathematics.  But he subsequently sojourned abroad, and spent 1893 and 1894 studying in Paris and Berlin.  Shortly after his return, Irving Fisher was appointed assistant professor of economics at Yale in 1895, and raised to full professor in 1898.  He retained his position at Yale until his retirement. Fisher was a colorful and eccentric figure. He was involved in various social fads, notably Fisher was an avid advocate of eugenics and health food diets.   He  made a fortune with his visible index card system - ancestral to the rolodex.  Fisher famously advocated the establishment of an 100% reserve requirement in the banking system   Irving Fisher's personal fortune was lost and his reputation was severely marred by the 1929 Wall Street Crash, when just days before the crash, he was reassuring investors that stock prices were not overinflated but, rather, had achieved a new, permanent plateau.

Bishop William Fleetwood, 1656-1723,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/fleetwood.htm," Born in the Tower of London, and descended from a notable Lancashire family, William Fleetwood was educated at Eton and enrolled in King's College, Cambridge in 1675.  Fleetwood was ordained an Anglican priest around the time of the Glorious Revolution 1688, and subsequently made rector of St. Austin's London.   Making a name for himself as a gifted preacher, he also became a lecturer and Dunstan's, and was appointed royal chaplain to king William III and Mary II of England.  He was made canon of Windsor around 1702.  In 1708, Fleetwood was invested at Bishop of St Asaph (Wales).  After the ascension of George I, Fleetwood was transferred in 1714 to the prestigious see of Bishop of Ely (Cambridgeshire).  In religious matters, Fleetwood was a solid, even zealous, Protestant Whig, who embraced the Glorious Revolution as Divine providence, confirming England's mission in the cause of international protestantism.   He opposed the High Church Toryism preached by Henry Sacheverell, that gained popularity in certain quarters (especially the universities) during Queen Anne's reign.  Fleetwood was one of the principal figures behind the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG), formed in 1701, to promote conversion of indigenous peoples in Africa,  as well as natives and slaves in the American colonies, to Anglican Christianity. Although sometimes casually referred to as a Mercantilist, William Fleetwood was not a Mercantilist thinker in any sense.  William Fleewtood's principal claim to be on this list was his 1707 Chronicon Preciosum, a massive collection of historical price statistics.  The nearly-as-massive sub-title of the second (1745) edition of the work explains Fleetwood's motive: he wanted to calculate if £5 in 1700 was worth the same as £5 in 1400.  The reason was eminently of urgent academic interest: an eligibility condition for receiving a fellowship established by a college charter c.1440 (conjectured that Fleetwood had either All Soul's, Oxford or his own King's College, Cambridge in mind) is that the student must not have an alternative outside income that exceeds £5. If he does, then he must forfeit the fellowship.  Fleetwood sought to demonstrate that this original £5 condition should be adjusted for purchasing power, that inflation since the 15th C. made it a very low threshold that most current students easily surpassed.   Fleetwood compared the value of different commodities and  stipends across the centuries concluded that the fellowship should be kept.  Fleetwood's 1707 treatise was heralded by Edgeworth (1925) as ""the oldest and one of the best treatises on index-numbers"" before the modern age. William Fleetwood touches on some economic matters in some of his sermons (e.g. clipping, 1694, debts, 1718), but more from angle of personal morality than political economy.

Alfred W. Flux, 1867-1942.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/flux.htm,"English marginalist economist and statistician.  Born in Portsmouth, A.W. Flux took undergraduate degree in mathematics Cambridge, becoming the first and only economist to top the Mathematics Tripos as Senior Wrangler in 1887 (and, at the time, the youngest).  He studied economics under the tutelage of Alfred Marshall.  In 1889, Flux won the Alfred Marshall Prize and was elected fellow at St. John's College, Cambridge.  In 1893, Flux took up the position of Cobden Lecturer in political economy at Owens College, Manchester, a position which had once been occupied by W. Stanley Jevons.  In the course of a famous review, Alfred W. Flux was the first to identify Wicksteed's 1894 theory of distribution as being captured by Euler's Theorem on homogeneous functions.  Flux's defense of Jevons's economics against Nicholson (1896) and his reviews of Pareto's Cours (1896-97) are other notable contributions. A.W. Flux was appointed Jevons Professor at Manchester in 1898.  In 1901, Flux moved to Canada, taking up an appointment at McGill University, helping launch the economics program there.  His Economics Principles (1904) was largely a product of his Manchester days and in 1906 oversaw a new edition of Jevons's Coal Question.  By this time, Flux was already growing disinterested in economic theory and taking a greater concern in applied and policy matters, notably in international trade.  Reviewing trade statistics in 1894, Flux at first dismissed concerns that foreign tariff policies were responsible for the decline in British trade, a position he would rectify in 1904.  Flux abandoned academia in 1908, returning to the UK to take up a position with the Board of Trade, where he would serve as a director of the British production censuses.  For the remainder of his career, Flux continued contributing to the development of national and international statistics.  Among his contributions here was the development of the British wholesale price index (1921) and production indices (1927).  Flux was an advocate (1929) of estimating national income from the production side rather than incomes (as had been pursued by his predecessor Giffen) and concerned with the development of standard criteria for comparative international statistics (1923).  He was a leading member of the Royal Statistical Society and recipient of the Guy Gold medal in 1930.  He had already been knighted in 1920. Flux married into a Danish family, and would spend much of his spare time, including his retirement, in Denmark.  During the course of his career, Flux tried frequently bring the work of Scandinavian economists to the attention of English-speaking world.      Major Works of A.W. Flux   Resources on Alfred W.

William Watts Folwell, 1833-1929,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/folwell.htm,"American historical economist and educator, first president of the University of Minnesota. Originating from Romulus, New York, William Watts Folwell was educated at Hobart College, receiving his degree in 1857, and staying as a mathematics lecturer.  In 1860, Folwell decamped for an academic tour of Germany, studying in Berlin.  He returned to the US to enlist and fight in the US Civil War.  After his discharge, Folwell resumed his calling as a teacher at Kenyon College in Ohio. In 1869, then merely 36 years old, W.W. Folwell became the first president of the University of Minnesota. The university had received a charter from the state of Minnesota back in 1851, but had to wait until the end of the Civil War to begin implementation.  Folwell submitted an ambitious plan to design the university of Minnesota along the line of the German model, with research-oriented graduate degrees, but this was resisted by the trustees, who preferred the Anglo-Saxon classics model.  Nonetheless, the plan was ultimately accepted, however implementation would take a much slower pace.  From his assumption, W.W. Folwell taught economics at Minnesota. Impressed by the German Historical School, Folwell wrote several papers on the methodology of economics, espousing the historical method.  Welcoming the ""new generation"" of young American historicists, Folwell was one of the few elder statesmen present at the beginning of the American Economic Association.  Folwell resigned the presidency in 1889, remaining professor of political economy and head of the department at Minnesota, until his retirement in 1907.

Born François Véron du Verger in Le Mans to a manufacturing family, Forbonnais was educated at a Jansenist school in Paris.  After leaving school, Forbonnais spent several years traveling across Spain and Italy on his father's business.  In 1743, he began working for his uncle in the bustling port of Nantes. Forbonnais acquired his economics education from reading the English Mercantilists and French thinkers like Vauban, but his main ideas were gathered from his practical experiences and careful observations of commercial life.   Veron de Forbonnais launched into print in 1750 with commentary on the economic sections of Montesquieu's L'Esprit des lois.  It was not a success.  Forbonnais moved to Paris in 1752, where he submitted several schemes for reforming public finances to the government.  In 1753 he translated two Mercantilist classics -- one by the Spanish mercantilist thinker Geronymo de Uztariz and another by the Englishman Charles King.   Attracting the attention of fellow Enlightenment thinkers, Forbonnais soon became part of the Parisian ""republic of letters"".   Between 1753 and 1755, Forbonnais contributed several articles to the famous Encyclopédie of Denis Diderot and Jean Le Rond d'Alembert (e.g. ""Colonies"", ""Commerce"", ""Concurrence"", ""Change"", ""Especes"" etc.).  However, it seems Forbonnais services were dispensed with in later volumes (when the Physiocrats entered the project).  But Forbonnais had moved on by then. Forbonnais expanded on some of his articles to produce his 1754 Éléments.  It was here that Forbonnais apparently developed an early version of Keynes's liquidity preference theory of money, arguing that interest is the ""tribute"" paid to money-hoarders to part with their cash.  In 1758, Forbonnais published his massive Recherches, an analytical history of French public finances.  The care and research he put in this work was unprecedented and unparalleled. (great chunks of it were used by the editor Rousselot de Surgy for the article in the finance volumes of the Encyclopédie Méthodique 1784-87)   The 1758 Recherches, together with his 1756 Considérations, remain enormously useful sources even today.   Forbonnais quickly became the leading economist in France.  He was appointed inspecteur général des monnaies in 1756 and then, in 1759, became the economic advisor to the contrôleur-général Silhouette and the Duke of Choiseul.  The ambitious reforms undertaken by this ministry, perhaps the first with the public welfare in mind, were primarily due to Forbonnais.  In 1763, he was ennobled by the Parlement of Metz and only now acquired the appellation ""de Fortbonnais"" (he became known thereafter as Véron de Forbonnais).   However, Forbonnais's star soon fell. A fiercely independent administrator and poor politician, Forbonnais made few friends and numerous enemies in the corridors of power. The Physiocrats, by now, had begun publishing and considered his Neo-Colbertiste doctrines their primary target.  A series of intrigues were hatched against him, several of them instigated by the powerful Madame de Pompadour, the king's mistress and the Physiocrats' benefactress. In 1763, Forbonnais unveiled his famous plan for a uniform ad valorem 15% import duty with no exemptions.  Even though it undermined the privileged classes,  it was approved by Choiseul and the Parlement of Paris.  However, Madame de Pompadour was incensed -- not only by the reforms, but also by the fact that she had not been consulted.   She had Louis XV exile Forbonnais to his estate in Champaissant in 1764. It was rescinded six weeks later, but, wary of stepping back into a nest of vipers, Forbonnais decided to stay put and focus on his lands. Forbonnais returned to Paris in 1766, searching for a colonial post. He ended up succeeding Dupont de Nemours in the editorship of the Journal de l'agriculture, du commerce et des finance.  He quickly turned it around, from a Physiocratic rag to a bastion of Neo-Colbertism.  In 1767, he published his Principes, collecting his critical examinations of  Physiocratic doctrine and putting forth perhaps his best statement of the Neo-Colbertiste position.  He attacked the Physiocrats again in his 1768 review of Abeille's tract.   In many ways, Forbonnais was fighting a rearguard action.  Although he was no friend of the privileged classes and tried to add many liberal features to Mercantilist doctrines, it was clear that their days were numbered. He remained convinced that Britain's power and wealth was due to (and not in spite of) its protectionist policies, and continued to recommend them for France.  His work was extremely influential on German Neo-Cameralists like Sonnenfels.  His criticisms of the Physiocrats focused on their land-obsessive produit net (Forbonnais believed that industry and commerce were also sources of wealth). Naturally, for such a practical and empirically-minded man, he deplored the Physiocrats' leaps of abstraction and what he perceived as a utopian vision of how the economy worked. As the Physiocrats fell from favor after 1769, Forbonnais rested his pen, preferring to concentrate on the affairs of his estates.  He re-emerged during the 1789 Revolution.  Although he failed to be elected to the Estates-General in 1789, Forbonnais was called to Paris in 1790 by the finance committee of the Constituent Assembly.  He focused his attention on monetary questions and published a tract on the assignats (oddly, one of his few signed works). After failing once again to be elected in 1791, Forbonnais returned to a quiet life back on his estate.   In 1794, Forbonnais was elected to the Institut de France, the new academy of sciences founded by the republicans.  He contributed a handful of articles under the name ""Viellard de la Sarthre"", to the Historien, a journal founded by Dupont de Nemours in 1796.   In 1799, turmoil in his region forced him to take refuge in Paris, where he died soon afterwards.

Samuel Fortrey, 1622-1681.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/fortrey.htm,"English Mercantilist author about whom very little is known, save that he served in the Privy Council of King Charles II of England.  Samuel Fortrey is the author of a celebrated 1663 tract, which was reprinted several times.  It was relatively liberal Mercantilist tract, and contained rudiments of the theory of comparative advantage.   But the fame of Fortrey's essay, however, rests almost entirely on his conjectural (and mistaken) calculations that England had a massive trade deficit with France. Without citing sources, Fortrey estimates that France was exporting £2.6m to Britain annually, whereas Britain only exported £1m to France, and thus ""our trade with France is at least £1.6m. a year clear lost to this kingdom"" (p.26) This figure was picked up and reiterated by later authors (e.g. Roger Coke), and contributed to increasing trade restriction with France in 1677-78. Prior English Mercantilist authors had usually been alarmed by the competition from the Dutch Republic, and indeed Mercantilist-inspired wars were pursued against the Dutch through the 1660s and early 1670s.   The shift of emphases towards relatively poorer but rising France in the late 1670s was not unrelated to political considerations.  However, it is unclear which is the cart and which is the horse.  Fortrey's figures were widely believed, contributed to the political atmosphere, and continued to be repeatedly cited well into the 18th C. Fortrey was one of the authors selected by McCulloch for reprinting in 1856.      Major Works of Samuel Fortrey     Resources on Samuel Fortrey   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
William Trufant Foster, 1879-1950.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/foster.htm#foster," Pre-Keynesian American underconsumption theorists. In their undergraduate years at the turn of the century, William Trufant Foster and Waddill Cathings had been classmates together in at Harvard.  Foster went on to become an college educator, while Catchings had gone into finance.  In 1919, they came together again at the Pollack Foundation for Economic Research - Catchings providing the economic expertise,  Foster providing the expository rhetoric - and promptly set about addressing the post-war slump. Foster & Catchings main theses were worked out in Profits (1925) and Money (1928).  They argued that insufficient consumer income is what leads to collapses in consumption and hence profits, prices and outputs.  They base their theory on a primitive but clumsy version of a multiplier-accelerator mechanism.   If retained company profits are hoarded (rather than being lent out), then consumer income is insufficient for consumers to absorb output. They argued that even if the firm invests this hoarded money itself (and thus pays the income out to workers), the problem is not solved: increased investment increases demand, yes, but it also pushes out output even further.  The imbalance between aggregate demand and supply, Foster and Catchings argue, will thus maintain itself.  Their theory contains a fatal flaw in the ""long-run"", but seen in a short-run, dynamic manner, it is reminiscent of that of Malthus during the General Glut controversy.  They publicly offered a cash award to any economist who could prove their argument flawed. Dozens upon dozens of people submitted proofs (e.g. Friedrich Hayek, 1929), but while they acknowledged minor errors, Foster and Catchings maintained that their central thesis remained correct.  Apparently, Foster and Catchings had early sympathizers in Paul H. Douglas and Charles F. Roos.   William Trufant Foster, 1879-1950.    W.T. Foster earned a B.A. and M.A. in Englsh from Harvard, where he first met Catchings.  Foster went on to become an innovative educator, he was the first president of Reed College (f.1910) - and the writer of its ""fight song""!  Foster resigned from Reed in 1919, and joined forces with Catchings at the Pollack Foundation for Economic Research.. Major Works of W.T. Foster Waddill Catchings, 1879-1967.- (1)  Harvard-trained economist, financier and businessman.  As a young, up-and-coming financier, Catchings had made his name helping reorganized troubled corporations. Famously, Catchings replaced Henry Goldman as senior partner of Goldman Sachs in 1918 and transformed the fledgling brokerage into a huge investment trust, establishing the Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation (effectively, a hedge fund), and nurtured its meteoric rise during the boom years of the 1920s, holding nearly half-billion dollars in assets. Catchings' fund was wiped out during the crash of 1929. Catchings would later become the head of Muzak Corp., who's business was largely sending centrally-played music by telephone wires to loudspeakers owned by subscribers, usually restaurants and hotels.

Herbert S. Foxwell, 1849-1936.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/foxwell.htm," Early English Neoclassical economist, and longtime professor at  University College London (UCL). Herbert S. Foxwell was educated at St. John's College in Cambridge, where he would remain as a fellow for the remainder of his life.  Foxwell was one of Alfred Marshall's first pupils.  Foxwell positioned himself as an early follower of Jevons and the Neoclassical revolution and helped further the advance of Cambridge Neoclassicism.  However, Foxwell was never quite as fond of pure economic theory as either Jevons or Marshall.  Foxwell had a more conciliatory attitude towards Classical economics and a penchant for the historical method, to which he grew increasingly attached over time. In 1875, when W.S. Jevons was appointed to the chair of University College London to replace Courtney, the young Foxwell stepped  in to teach in Jevons's place for a semester while Jevons wrapped up his commitments at Owens College, Manchester. After Jevons's retirement in 1881, Foxwell was offered to succeed to his chair at University College London (UCL).  Foxwell was reluctant to accept, hoping to obtain the professorship at his beloved Cambridge.  But Alfred Marshall was eager to secure the UCL chair for the Neoclassicals and persuaded Foxwell to accept it, on the promise that it would be only temporary, and that Foxwell would eventually succeed to the Cambridge chair on Marshall's own retirement.  While a professor at UCL, Foxwell remained his residence in Cambridge, lecturing at St. John's throughout and participating in Cambridge-related activities. Foxwell was a vigorous proponent Cambridge extension lectures and participated in lecture tours to working class audiences.  He was a founder and leading member of the Cambridge Junior Liberal Club (f. 1882), the Cambridge branch of the Imperial Federation League (1885) and the first president of the Cambridge Economic Club (1887).  During this time, Foxwell grew particularly entranced by the bimetallism question. However, by the mid-1900s, it became obvious that the younger and more theoretically-minded Arthur C. Pigou had become Marshall's heir-apparent. The strained relationship between Marshall and Foxwell finally broke when Pigou was appointed to the Cambridge chair upon Marshall's retirement in 1908.  That same year, Foxwell's student, Henry Higgs, proposed to raise money for a second chair at Cambridge specifically for Foxwell, but the retired Marshall leaped in to sink the proposal, openly declaring Foxwell unfit.  To this injury was added insult in 1916, when Pigou petitioned for exemption from military service in World War I, on account that there was ""no one"" at Cambridge able to replace him (Foxwell mischievously wrote to the draft council reminding them he was available and ready.)  Although still resident at Cambridge and lecturing there throughout, the repeated entanglements with Marshall and Pigou drove Foxwell to gradually withdraw his loyalties and commitments from that university, and focusing more on UCL. Herbert S. Foxwell was an avid book collector.  Having married in 1898 and in urgent need of money, Foxwell sold his massive economics library, consisting of some 40,000 books and pamphlets on economic topics, to the Goldsmiths' Company of London in 1901 for £10,000, which promptly donated it to the UCL.   The company granted  Foxwell a further £4,000  to complete collections and bind the volumes.  Foxwell's collection is currently held as the Goldsmiths' Library in the Senate House Library at UCL.   But this was not the end of Foxwell's bibliomania.  Foxwell amassed a new collection after 1901.  In financial straits after the 1929 crash, Foxwell's sold his second collection of 20,000 volumes to Harvard University for £4,000, becoming the Kress Library at Harvard.

Charles Fourier, 1772-1837.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/fourier.htm,"French utopian socialist. Unlike his contemporary rival, Henri de Saint-Simon, the half-mad Charles Fourier was an outright utopian.  Although Fourier was anti-state, anti-industry, anti-liberal, anti-competition and anti-urban, he distanced himself from the radical socialists who wanted the abolition of private property.   Instead, Fourier envisaged an utopian society in ""natural harmony"" with the cosmos that could be achieved by non-violent means. Fourier advocated the setting up phalanxes, a type of production and consumption co-operative enterprise or society.  Through his main publication, Réforme industrielle, Fourier collected numerous followers, many of whom attempted (and failed) at setting up these mini-societies.  He was highly disliked by the Marxians.      Major Works of Charles Fourier   Resources on Charles Fourier   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Benjamin Franklin, 1706-1790,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/franklin.htm," Journalist, inventor, statesman and diplomat, the American polymath Benjamin Franklin is too well-known to need an introduction. Less well-known are his contributions to economics. Franklin was particularly concerned with both the situation of America -- notably impact of the the British Mercantilist policies, abundant land and scarce labor on American economic development.  Franklin was much inspired by William Petty, particularly on population, believing that labor, rather than gold, was the appropriate measure of value (for this, Franklin was given an enthusiastic applause by Marx).  Franklin departed from the Mercantilists in the ""war"" concept of commerce.  Echoing the Physiocrats, Franklin (1769) believed land and agriculture was the ""natural"" way of increasing the nations wealth. Curiously, his economic ideas had little impact on the younger American statesmen that sat at his feet.  Thomas Jefferson was entranced by the work of Condillac and Destutt de Tracy, Alexander Hamilton's writings on paper currency inclined him to John Law's doctrines, while James Madison signed up with Malthus on population.  Benjamin Franklin was one of the founders of the University of Pennsylvania.      Major Works of Benjamin Franklin   Resources on Benjamin Franklin   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Milton Friedman, 1912-2006.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/friedman.htm," One of the most highly influential economists, political commentators and essayists of the century, Milton Friedman is one of the best known economists known to the general public in recent decades. An ardent opponent of the Keynesian economics, Friedman led the ""Monetarist"" incarnation of the Chicago School against the Keynesian orthodoxy in the 1960s and early 1970s. (click here for our Survey of Monetarism) Born in Brooklyn to Romanian parents, Friedman studied at the University of Chicago as an undergraduate, wrote an empirical master's thesis under Henry Schultz and then proceeded to Columbia University for doctoral work.  Under the wing of Harold Hotelling, James Angell and Wesley Mitchell, Friedman was launched as an empirical economist, focusing on mathematical statistics and business cycles.  Friedman became a member of Mitchell's NBER in 1937 and served for a few years on Hotelling's Statistical Research Group during the war. Abraham Wald, who was also on the SRG, credits Friedman as an inspirer of his ""sequential design"" system of statistical inference.  His empirical work with Simon Kuznets (1945) set the stage for his later contributions to consumption theory.  Friedman obtained his Ph.D from Columbia in 1946 and got an appointment at the University of Chicago that same year. Friedman's early contributions include his formulation of  risk-aversion and risk-proclivity (1948, with L.J. Savage), his use of evolutionary theory in the theory of the firm (1953), his controversial propositions for a ""positivist"" methodology in economics (1953) and, perhaps most fundamentally, the ""Permanent Income Hypothesis"" in consumption theory (1957).   Friedman's important criticisms of Keynesian theory began with his attack on the IS-LM dichotomy in his ""restatement"" of the Quantity Theory in 1956 -- effectively, reminding Keynesians that ""money matters"". This was followed up by a massive historical study with Anna J. Schwartz on the Monetary History of the United States (1963) - leading to a famous debate on money-income causality.  In his famous presidential address to the American Economic Association, Friedman (1968) then focused his attention upon the apparent breakdown of the Phillips Curve relationship in the 1970s.  He proposed to replace it with a ""Natural Rate of Unemployment"" (NRU) - a concept later formalized in more detail by the New Classicals. Friedman wrote much on various aspects of  economic policy.  In general, he argued that government discretionary ""fine-tuning"" of the economy, as had been proposed by Keynesians, ought to be replaced with iron ""rules"" of policy - notably his famous ""money supply growth"" rule (1959).    Milton Friedman has also been a widely-read advocate of laissez-faire economic policies, particularly stressing the linkage between free markets and liberal democracy which has come to characterize the ""Neo-Liberal"" (or ""Neo-Conservative"" for Americans) movement that gained ground particularly in the 1980s.  He was a founding member of the Mont Pelerin Society organized by Friedrich Hayek in 1947.  Friedman's regular columns in Newsweek (1966-1984) and his best-selling popular volumes (e.g. 1962, 1972, 1980, 1984) have made him quite a celebrity.  His political involvements have made him a lightning rod for both critics and advocates of ""neo-liberalism"".   He was an adviser for Barry Goldwater in 1964, Richard Nixon in 1968 and Ronald Reagan in 1980.  The British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher credited Friedman with inspiring many of her reforms.    However, Friedman's role as an economic advisor to the Chilean military dictator, Augusto Pinochet, in the mid-1970s, earned him much criticism, from foes and friends alike, arguing that he had betrayed his support of political freedom by cooperating with such an unsavory regime.  Friedman's response was that it was entirely consistent: free markets, he claimed, are a pre-condition and indeed, a catalyst for democracy and credits precisely the liberalization of markets he helped engineer for the subsequent democratization of Chile.   Friedman won the Nobel Memorial prize in 1976.  He retired from the University of Chicago and has, since 1977, been a fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.  He continued to be actively involved in debates on economic theory and policy up until his death in 2006.

Ragnar A.K. Frisch, 1895-1973.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/frisch.htm," The Norwegian economist Ragnar Frisch was the lord of economic nomenclature. He coined many of the words and phrases we are now familiar with in economics, such as ""macroeconomics"", ""econometrics"" and ""flow-input, point-output"", ""impulse and propagation"", etc.  Some of his novel words did not really catch on (e.g. ""passus coefficient"", ""polypoly"", the ""pari-passu law"",  etc.), but that hardly deterred him.    At any rate, Frisch was in an excellent position to be master wordsmith:  he also helped create the very fields he littered with his nomenclature.   Born 1895 in Oslo, the only son of a silversmith, Frisch was expected to follow his father's trade and took positive steps in that direction, e.g. an apprenticeship, a journeyman year.  He studied economics at the University of Oslo (graduating in 1919), but he remained involved in his father's silversmithy.  After a couple of years studying in Paris and England, Frisch returned to lecture at Oslo in 1924, becoming assistant professor in 1925. Frisch research on economic theory and statistics yielded his famous 1926 paper on consumer theory (followed up by his 1932 book) which set in motion the axiomatization of consumer demand and set forth the possibility of empirically measuring marginal utility.  It was here, incidentally, where the term ""econometric"" was first used.   Another of Frisch's idiosyncratic claims to fame was his meticulousness and apparent reluctance to publish; despite the great popularity and dissemination of his working papers and monographs.  In the 1920s, he began lecturing on production theory, constructing in the process much of  the formal Neoclassical theory of production.  Frisch's classnotes of the 1920s were eventually published in a 1965 book -- long after his contributions had made their way into the theoretical canon.  His dissertation (1927) on time series and statistics were also distributed widely in monograph form.  Work done during the war on the computation of elasticities was only published in 1959.  Finally, there is the famous ""macrodynamic/time series"" research program that he worked on -- and famously announced in his famous 1933 Cassel festschrift -- which was never quite finished and so never published. In 1927, he left for a Rockefeller Foundation trip to the United States, meeting the leading mathematical economists of the day.  He made a particularly strong impression of Irving Fisher and, together with Charles Roos, they began planning the formation of the Econometric Society. Soon after Frisch returned in 1928, his father died, leaving the family business in his hands. He made the conscious decision to press ahead with his economics work, delegating much of the management of the silversmithy to others.  In 1930, on Fisher's invitation, Frisch left for the United States to spend a couple of years at Yale and Minnesota.  It was a quite fruitful sojourn: Frisch not only produced several excellent papers and monographs, he also set the Econometric Society in motion.   Frisch returned to Oslo in 1931.  In 1932, he founded the Rockefeller-funded Institute of Economics at the University of Oslo. It was this time he put the finishing touches on his American work and, with his student, Trygve Haavelmo, went off in search of the macrodynamic grail.  He also began his job as a highly influential Editor-in-Chief of Econometrica, a position he would hold from 1933 until 1955.  He was imprisoned for a year by the Nazis during the war.  He stayed remained at Oslo for much of the rest of his life. Frisch's impact on economics has been substantial.  His 1926 paper helped set the axiomatic-deductive Neo-Walrasian research programme in motion.   His formalization of production theory (1965) has already been mentioned.  Frisch's work on econometrics - particularly on time series (1927) and linear regression analysis (e.g. 1934) - was to be a fundamental contribution to the later Cowles approach to econometrics. His 1933 work on impulse-propagation business cycles, (together with that of Slutsky) was to prove the organizing principle behind much of modern New Classical real business cycle theory. He also contributed much to large decision models for government planning.  Justifiably, Ragnar Frisch shared the first Nobel Memorial Prize  in 1969 with Jan Tinbergen.      Major works of Ragnar A.

John Fullarton, 1780-1849.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/fullarton.htm,"Scottish EIC officer, physician and banker. John Fullarton was the son of a Glasgow academic.  In his youth, Fullarton was employed by the East India Company and dispatched as a medical officer to India in 1802.  During his stay, he set up a newspaper in Calcutta.  Fullarton resigned from the EIC in 1813, and entered as a partner in the private banking house of Alexander & Co. in Calcutta.  Fullarton acquired an immense fortune in a short time and returned to Britain a rich man, ensconsing himself in a mansion in the Mayfair district of London.  John Fullarton was an strident advocate of the ""Banking School"", alongside Tooke, during the 1840s phase of the Bullionist Controversy. Although Fullarton had barely participated in economic debates before, only an occasional article in the Quarterly Review on parliamentary reform,  his entry into the banking controversy was perhaps the most theoretically interesting.  John Fullarton's great treatise, On the Regulation of Currencies was published in August 1844 - just a tad too late to influence the passage of Peel's 1844 Banking Act  (a second edition was put out the next year). Nonetheless, it was a remarkable tract, arguably the most penetrating theoretical performance in the debate, with an advanced understanding of money and banking before its time.  Fullarton attacked the ""currency principle"" with vigor.  Fullarton noted the error of Currency School advocates (like Torrens) of confusing money with cash, and asserted that bank deposits were also part of the money supply (p.41), and that trying to control prices by just restricting banknotes (rather than the money supply as a whole) was ""hopeless"" (p.50-51).  Fullarton aligned himself with the old ""real bills doctrine"" of the 1810s debate (e.g. p.207).  He asserts that there is little prospect of the banks over-issuing notes by a ""law of reflux"" (e.g. p.67, p.84, etc.). Fullarton's law is a modification of the old real bills doctrine, although the details of the reflux mechanism has been variously interpreted.  In the simplest view, Fullarton recognized that since money is injected by banks into the economy via bank loans to private persons (rather than directly spent on goods), then the supply of bank money (""nine-tenths"" of the total money supply) depends on loan demand.   And loan demand, of course, varies with the real economy, so money supply can never been in excess.  In slumps, when loan demand declines, fewer loans are forthcoming and existing loans repaid, bringing down the supply of bank money, while any excess supply of notes that happen to be in circulation will flow back to the banks that issued them.  So an excess supply of notes will not lead to increased expenditure and inflation, but be returned to the issuing banks and be extinguished before it has any effect on spending, i.e. excess money supplies correct themselves and do not spill over into goods markets.  Fullarton argued this applied to both the Bank of England and country banks, thus any quantitative restrictions are unnecessary and, indeed, undesirable.  In sum, Fullarton argued that the money supply was an endogenous variable and would vary according to real economy. Against Torrens and quantity theorists, Fullarton asserts business cycles usually have real, and not monetary, causes, that money-income causality  runs from income to money. (p.101)  Fullarton extended this to the international situation, noting that balance of payments deficits were not monetary but caused by real factors.  He recommended the Bank simply hold enough gold reserves and wait for real factors to adjust, rather than attempt to stem the outflow of gold (from the B of P deficit) with credit contraction, which is not only futile, but has the danger of provoking a panic. Fullarton lost - or rather came too late - to the debate in 1844.  But  when the Bank of England was forced to suspend issue in 1847 (in a review of his own book), Fullarton crowed that he had been proven right.  While Fullarton's treatise was well-regarded by some contemporaries (e.g. John Stuart Mill), the mechanism was poorly understood, and quantity theorists of the late 19th C. (e.g. Walker) often dismissed Fullarton as a crank.  However, some (e.g. Wagner) appreciated and lauded his insights, particularly Fullarton's deeper understanding of the bank as a firm, and the increasing role of banking in a modern economy.  After a period of neglect and derision,  Fullarton's reputation has been retroactively refurbished since the Keynesian revolution, particularly among Post Keynesians.

Celso Furtado, 1920,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/schools/develop.htm#furtado," For many lay people, economic development - by which we mean the analysis of the economic progress of nations - is what economics as a whole is designed to address. Indeed, what but to find the ""nature and causes"" of economic development was Adam Smith's purpose? For modern economists, however, the status of economic development is somewhat more uncomfortable: it has always been the maverick field, lurking somewhere in the background but not really considered ""real economics"" but rather an amalgam of sociology, anthropology, history, politics and, all-too- often, ideology. Nonetheless, few of the greatest economists actually ignored it outright. As already noted, Adam Smith and indeed, perhaps the entire Classical School was concerned with what might be termed ""economic development"". Schumpeter's first famous book was entitled a Theory of Economic Development (1911). The German Historical School - and its English and American counterparts - could very well be deemed part of development economics. The entire theory of economic growth can be said to be geared towards it or even underlying it. Nonetheless, ""economic development"", as it is now understood, really only started in the 1930s when, prompted by Colin Clark's 1939 quantitative study, economists began realizing that most of humankind did not live in an advanced capitalist economic system. However, the great early concern was still Europe: namely, postwar European reconstruction and the industrialization of its eastern fringes - as exemplified by the pioneering 1943 article of Paul Rosenstein- Rodan and Kurt Mandelbaum's 1947 tome. It was only some time after the war that economists really began turning their concerns towards Asia, Africa and Latin America. To this end, decolonization was an important catalyst. Faced with a new plethora of nations whose standards of living and institutions were so different from the European, modern development theory, by which we mean the analysis not only of growth but also of the institutions which could induce, sustain and accelerate growth, began in earnest. Early development theorists - such as Bert Hoselitz, Simon Kuznets, W. Arthur Lewis, Hla Myint were among the first economists to begin analyzing economic development as a distinct subject. The post-war formation of the United Nations - and its attendant agencies, such as the World Bank, the I.M.F., the I.L.O. and the various regional commissions - proved to be another important impetus. The commissioning of numerous studies by these institutions led to the emergence of a non-academic strand of development theory. Development as Growth and Capital-Formation Early economic development theory was but merely an extension of conventional economic theory which equated ""development"" with growth and industrialization. As a result, Latin American, Asian and African countries were seen mostly as ""underdeveloped"" countries, i.e. ""primitive"" versions of European nations that could, with time, ""develop"" the institutions and standards of living of Europe and North America. As a result, ""stage theory"" mentality of economic development dominated discussions of economic development. As later made famous by Alexander Gerschenkron (1953, 1962) and, more crudely, Walt W. Rostow (1960), the stages theories argued that all countries passed through the same historical stages of economic development and that current underdeveloped countries were merely at an earlier stage in this linear historical progress while First World (European and North American) nations were at a later stage. ""Linear stages"" theories had been developed earlier by German Historicists, thus it ought not be surprising to find historians, such as Gerschenkron and Rostow, among its main adherents. More enlightened attempts to arrive at an empirical definition of the concept of ""underdevelopment"", as exemplified by the work of Hollis Chenery, Simon Kuznets and Irma Adelman, led to the general conclusion that while there were not explicit ""linear stages"", countries tended nonetheless to exhibit similar patterns of development, although some differences could and did persist. The task of the development economist, in this light, was to suggest ""short-cuts"" by which underdeveloped countries might ""catch up"" with the developed and leap over a few stages. By equating development with output growth, early development theorists, prompted by Ragnar Nurkse (1952), identified capital formation as the crucial component to accelerate development. The celebrated early work on the ""dual economy"" by Sir W. Arthur Lewis (1954, 1955) precisely stressed the role of savings in development. Early Keynesians, such as Kaldor and Robinson, attempted to call attention to the issue of income distribution as a determinant of savings and growth. Even modern Marxians such as Maurice Dobb (1951, 1960) focused on the issue of savings-formation. Of course, savings could themselves be manipulated by government intervention - as Lewis had intimated and the Keynesians insisted. Indeed, earlier, Rosenstein-Rodan (1943) had argued that increasing returns to scale made government-directed industrialization feasible. The notion of turning ""vicious circles"" of low savings and low growth into ""virtuous circles"" of high savings and high growth by government intervention was reiterated by Hans W. Singer in his doctrine of ""balanced growth"" and Gunnar Myrdal in his theory of ""cumulative causation"". Thus, government involvement - whether by planning, socio-economic engineering or effective demand management - was regarded as a critical tool of economic development. Other economists turned to international trade as the great catalyst to growth. Already Hla Myint, Gottfried Haberler and Jacob Viner had stressed this avenue - arguing along lines similar to the classical doctrine of Adam Smith that trade and specialization can increase the ""extent of the market"". However, earlier in the 1930s, D.H. Robertson had expressed his doubts on this account - and these were later reiterated by Ragnar Nurkse, H.W. Singer and Rául Prebisch. Social Aspects of Economic Development Although capital-formation never really left the field, the meaning of the term mutated somewhat over time. T.W. Schultz, drawing upon his famous Chicago School thesis, turned away from physical capital accumulation to emphasize the need for ""human capital"" formation. This led to an emphasis on education and training as pre-requisites of growth and the identification of the problem of the ""brain drain"" from the Third World to the First (and, as would later be stressed, from the private sector to government bureaucracies). W. Arthur Lewis and Hans W. Singer extended Schultz's thesis by arguing that social development as a whole - notably education, health, fertility, etc. - by improving human capital, were also necessary pre-requisites for growth. In this view, industrialization, if it came at the cost of social development, could never be self-sustaining. However, it was really only in 1969 that Dudley Seers finally broke the growth fetishism of development theory. Development, he argued, was a social phenomenon that involved more than increasing per capita output. Development meant, in Seers's opinion, eliminating poverty, unemployment and inequality as well. Singer, Myrdal and Adelman were among the first old hands to acknowledge the validity of Seers's complaint and many younger economists, such as Mahbub ul Haq, were galvanized by Seers's call to redefine economic development. Thus, structural issues such as dualism, population growth, inequality, urbanization, agricultural transformation, education, health, unemployment,etc. all began to be reviewed on their own merits, and not merely as appendages to an underlying growth thesis. Particularly worthy of note was the resurrection of the work of Chayanov on the unique structures of peasant economies. Also emergent, in this period, was a debate on the very desirability of growth. E.F. Schumacher, in a famously provocative popular book, Small is Beautiful (1973), argued against the desirability of industrialization and extolled the merits of handicrafts economies. As the world environmental crisis became clearer in the 1980s, this debate took a new twist as the very sustainability of economic development was questioned. It became clear that the very desirability of development needed to be reconsidered. Structuralism and its Discontents Before Seers's complaint, many economists had already felt extraordinarily uncomfortable with early development theory and the implicit assumptions behind ""stages"" reasoning. A new (or old - depending on one's vantage point) idea began to germinate - what may be loosely termed ""structuralism"". The ""structuralist"" thesis, succinctly, called attention to the distinct structural problems of Third World countries: underdeveloped countries, they argued, were not merely ""primitive versions"" of developed countries, rather they had distinctive features of their own. As mentioned, Chenery had argued a similar thesis, but nonetheless focused on the similarities of experience. The newer structuralists, in contrast, sought to bring attention to the differences. Albert O. Hirschmann (1958) was one of the early few who stressed the need for country-specific analysis of development - as was stressed later by Dudley Seers. One of these distinctive features was that, unlike European industrialization, Third World industrialization was supposed to occur while these countries existed alongside already- industrialized Western countries and were tied to them by trade. This, speculated a few, could give rise to distinct structural problems for development. Coincidental with H.W. Singer, the UNCLA economist, Raúl Prebisch, formulated the famous ""dependency"" theory of economic development, wherein he argued that the world had developed into a ""center-periphery"" relationship among nations, where the Third World was regressing into becoming the producer of raw materials for First World manufacturers and were thus condemned to a peripheral and dependent role in the world economy. Thus, Prebisch concluded, some degree of protectionism in trade was necessary if these countries were to enter a self-sustaining development path. Import-substitution, enabled by protection and government policy, rather than trade and export-orientation, was the preferred strategy. Historical examples of government-directed industrialization, such as Meiji Japan and Soviet Russia, were held up as proof that there was not only one path to development, as had been implied by the cruder ""stages"" theories. The Prebisch-Singer thesis resounded with particularly with Marxian thinkers - who identified elements of Rosa Luxemburg's and V.I. Lenin's arguments on imperialism in it. Breaking with savings-obsessed orthodox Marxian thinkers such as Dobb, Neo-Marxians such as Paul Baran, Paul Sweezy, A.G. Frank and Samir Amin took the Prebisch-Singer thesis, merged it the Luxemburg thesis, and drew it into the modern era.  Many Third World governments adopted the language and policies of the structuralists and/or the Neo-Marxians in the 1960s and 1970s, and indeed, the movement seemed to have been eminently influential. ""Neo-Colonialism"", ""core-periphery"" and ""dependency"" were the catch-words of the day.  However, as time moved on, these policies seemed to fail to yield their promised fruit, and a Neoclassical (or, more accurately, Neo-Liberal) countermovement initiated by the lone voices of P.T. Bauer, I.M.D. Little, Deepak Lal, Bela Balassa, Anne Krueger and Harry G. Johnson began to gain more adherents. Their thesis was simple: government intervention did not only not improve development, it in fact thwarted it. The emergence of huge bureaucracies and state regulations, they argued, suffocated private investment and distorted prices making developing economies extraordinarily inefficient. In their view, the ills of unbalanced growth, dependency, etc. were all ascribed to too much government dirigisme, not too little. In recent years, the Neoclassical thesis has gained greater adherence, particularly in Latin America. However, the evidence is still ambivalent and disputed. Both structuralists and counter-structuralists point to fast East Asian development and disastrous African experience as proofs of their directly opposing theses.

John Kenneth Galbraith, 1908-2006,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/galbraith.htm," The Canadian-born John Kenneth Galbraith has been considered by many as the ""Last American Institutionalist"". As a result, Galbraith has remained something of a renegade in modern economics - and his work has been nothing if not provocative. Raised on a small farm in rural Ontario, John Kenneth Galbraith studied at Ontario Agricultural College, and then went moved to the United States to study agricultural economics at UC Berkeley, receiving his Ph.D. in 1934.  Galbraith joined the Harvard faculty as instructor in agricultural economics in 1936.  During WWII, now a naturalized US citizen, Galbraith moved to Washington DC to become a deputy chief of the Office of Price Administration (1941-43).  After a series of other government missions, Galbraith returned to Harvard in 1948. In the 1950s, Galbraith presented economics with two tracts that needled the mainstream: one developing a theory of price control (which arose out of his wartime experience in the Office of Price Administration) which he argued for as an anti-inflation policy (1952); the second, American Capitalism (1952), which argued that American post-war success arose not out of ""getting the prices right"" in an orthodox sense, but rather of ""getting the prices wrong"" and allowing industrial concentration to develop. It is a formula for growth because it enables technical innovation which might otherwise not been done. However, it can only be regarded as successful provided there is a ""countervailing power"" against potential abuse in the form of trade unions, supplier and consumer organizations and government regulation. Many have since argued the formula for East Asian success later in the century was based precisely on this combination of oligopolistic power and ""countervailing"" institutions. It was his smallish 1958 book, The Affluent Society, that earned Galbraith his popular reknown and professional emnity. Although the thesis was not astoundingly new - having long been argued by Veblen, Mitchell and Knight - his attack on the myth of ""consumer sovereignty"" went against the cornerstone of mainstream economics and, in many ways, the culturally hegemonic ""American way of life"". His New Industrial State (1967) expanded on Galbraith's theory of the firm, arguing that the orthodox theories of the perfectly competitive firm fell far short in analytical power. Firms, Galbraith claimed, were oligopolistic, autonomous institutions vying for market share (and not profit maximization) which wrested power away from owners (entrepreneurs/shareholders), regulators and consumers via conventional means (e.g. vertical integration, advertising, product differentiation) and unconventional ones (e.g. bureaucratization, capture of political favor), etc. Naturally, these were themes already well-espoused in the old American Institutionalist literature, but in the 1960s, they had been apparently forgotten in economics. The issue of ""political capture"" by firms was expanded upon in his 1973 Economics and the Public Purpose. But new themes were added - notably, that of public education, the political process and stressing the provision of public goods. Although often not acknowledging it explicitly, many economists have since pursued themes raised by Galbraith. The issue of political capture has been followed up by Buchanan and ""Public Choice"" economics, the objectives and conduct of the firm by Simon and the ""New Institutionalist"" schools, the failure of consumer sovereignty by Scitovsky and others. Even the game- theoretic developments in industrial organization have replayed Galbraithian themes. Although Galbraith is outside the mainstream, that did not prevent them from electing him president of the American Economic Association in 1972.  Galbraith certainly remains one of the better-known economists in post-war America and has worked in a variety of capacities. Besides his tenure at Harvard and the Office of Price Administration, Galbraith was editor of Fortune magazine for several years, director of the US Strategic Bombing Survey, chairman of the Americans for Democratic Action in the late 1960s, television and newspaper commentator, advisor and speechwriter for John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern. He also served as the American ambassador to India in the early 1960s and tried his hand at two novels (1968, 1990).      Major works of John Kenneth Galbraith   Resources on John K.

Born in New York City, David Gale studied mathematics at Swarthmore, Michigan and obtained his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1949.  His doctoral thesis was conducted under Albert W   Tucker  on the then-nascent field of game theory.  He contributed several papers to Kuhn and Tucker's Contributions to the Theory of Games (1950, 1953).  He also provided an early existence theory in general equilibrium theory (1955). Gale's 1960 textbook was an early classic of mathematical economics, popularizing linear programming methods.  His 1962 article with Lloyd Shapley introduced a famous stable matching algorithm, then went on to have multiple practical applications.

Ferdinando Galiani, 1728-1787.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/galiani.htm,"  Neapolitan abbot and government official,  Ferdinando Galiani was a prominent figure of the ""Neapolitan Enlightenment"" and one of the progenitors of the Italian utility tradition. Born in Chieti, Kingdom of Naples, Ferdinando Galiani was the son of a royal auditor. When he was eight years old, Galiani was placed under the tutorship of his uncle Celestino Galiani, Archbishop of Taranto, then attached to the royal court of Naples, who arranged a diet of philosophy, mathematics and law.  But Galiani was more of a wit than a scholar. Galiani's first work was a parody of a eulogy, skewering the Neapolitan academy, which caused a bit of an uproar. While still a student, Galiani produced a dialogue on the state of ancient coinage during the Trojan War. Invited to deepen his argument, Galiani went on to produce his most celebrated economics tract, the 1750 Della Moneta, written anonymously when he was 22-years old.  Galiani introduced an alternative theory of value based of utility and scarcity, making him therefore the ""Grandfather of the Marginalist Revolution"".  Otherwise, Galiani's tract exhibited conventional Mercantilist ideas and some of his recommendations were adopted by the Neapolitan government. (it is here that Galiani  helped rediscover and popularize the great Mercantilist tract of Antonio Serra, after a century-and-a-half of obscurity.) Ferdinando Galiani entered a clerical career, and was invested as a titular abbot of Santa Catarina a Celano in 1750, with a benefice of 500 ducats. To complete his education and capitalize on his early success, his uncle dispatched him on a tour of Italy in late 1750.  Galiani visited Rome, where he was received in the court of Pope Benedict XIV, then proceeded to visit other major urban centers, like Florence, Padua and Turin (where he entertained the Piedmontese court of king Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia-Savoy with his wit).  Galiani was back in Naples in 1753.  His uncle died the next year, but Galiani was already well-established in his connections in the Neapolitan court and was in correspondence with other writers throughout Italy.  His intellectual activities thereafter were varied, he composed a work on the conservation of grain, took an interest in the Roman ruins of Herculaneum,  composed a funerary oration for Benedict XIV, etc. In January 1759, Galiani was appointed as secretary to the Neapolitan embassy in France, arriving in June1759, and remaining there for the next few years.  His wit flourished in the Versailles court.  When Galiani presented his credentials to Louis XV for the first time, Galiani (a man of short stature) remarked ""You majesty, before you is only a sample of the secretary, the secretary will follow"".   Galiani carried a pet monkey with him around Versailles, and when the monkey got into some mischief, Galiani would take an opportunity for wit, comparing the monkey's antics to some philosopher or politician. Galiani fell in quickly with the French  philosophes, and communicated many of their ideas (on education reform, etc.) in his correspondence back to Naples.  While in Paris, Galiani also composed a well-received study of Horace (published anonymously in the Gazette litteraire in 1765) and a treatise on Sicilian law.  In 1765, while on holiday in Ischia, Galiani drafted a memoir on recent grain shortages in France.  Impressed, Galiani was promptly appointed the royal council on commerce in Naples.  But Galiani was quickly bored in Naples, and after some lobbying, was allowed to resume his position at the Neapolitan embassy in Paris by November 1766.  In 1767, Galiani visited London and Amsterdam, and shortly after returning to Paris, engaged the geographer Rizzi-Zannoni to compose a comprehensive map of the Kingdom of Naples. Galiani term in Paris ended in May 1769, and he returned to Naples.  Many in the French court were glad to see him go - Galiani's acerbic wit had earned him many enemies over the years.   But Galiani left with a departing blow. Galiani's Mercantilist ideas had been deepened during his stays in the northern commercial capitals, but just around this time, the Physiocrats were reaching the peak of their influence.  So Galiani composed his Dailogues sur les bles (published 1770), directly in opposition to them.  Reinvoking the long-lost 1613 insights of Antonio Serra (which he rediscovered), Galiani noted that there are increasing returns to manufacturing, and diminishing returns to agriculture, and that the wealth of a nation ultimately depends on manufacturing and trade.  Although approving of the edict of 1764 liberalizing the grain trade, Galiani rejected much of the Physiocratic analysis, notably its ""land theory of value"".    His 1770 piece also provided a quite modern analysis of balance of payments.  Despite his theoretical brilliance and his sympathy with the idea of  ""natural"" laws in economics, Galiani was a rather practical man,  skeptical about the reach of abstract theory, particularly when action was necessary and urgent.  He was repelled by the wide-eyed policies called for by the Physiocrats, which he believed were half-baked, unrealistic and impractical and, in times of crisis,  downright dangerous.  Watching the Physiocrats dither about ""natural state"" during a famine in France in 1768 infuriated the acid-tongued Galiani (and many other contemporaries).   He maintained, throughout his life, a consistently healthy suspicion of any theory that purported to claim ""universality"" of application, noting that propositions which may work in one time or place, might not work in others.   Galiani could count Denis Diderot as one of his strongest supporters and followers -- as well as good friend. It was Diderot who arranged for the publication of the Dialogues in 1770, after Galiani's departure.  The tract was a success.  Voltaire lauded it effusively, and even Frederick the Great of Prussia wrote Galiani to congratulate him.  The Physiocrats did not take it well, and struggled to reply to it.  . After his return to Naples, Galiani resumed his position on the council of commerce, but kept up a correspondence with his French friends.  Besides his official duties, Galiani also resumed his work on Horace (never completed),  composed a libretto for an opera on Socrates (set to music by Paesiello and performed in 1775).  After the eruption of Vesuvius in 1779, Galiani wrotre a little humorous tract, satirizing other writings about it.  He engaged in linguistic studies on the Neapolitan dialect, and composed a 1782 tract on diplomacy and wrote a few more humorous tracts under the pseudonym ""Don Onoforio Galeota"" (the actual name of a rival).

Originating from Milan, Italy, Pierangelo (or simply Piero) Garegnani studied at the University of Pavia, producing a master's thesis on David Ricardo. This won Garegnani a scholarship to continue his studies in 1953 at Trinity College, Cambridge, coming under the tutelage of Maurice Dobb, and (more influentially) Piero Sraffa.  Garegnani received his doctorate in 1958 with a massive dissertation on heterogeneous capital (which would yield several later papers). Garegnani returned to Italy in 1958. A revised version of Garegnani's thesis was published (in Italian) in the same year (1960) as Sraffa's PCMC  In 1961-62, a Rockefeller foundation grant brought Garegnani stayed to MIT, where he met future antagonists Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow.  Garegnani helped launch the Cambridge critique (1966) of Neoclassical capital theory. Garegnani was a prominent leader of the Neo-Ricardian school, proposing to synthesize Keynes's theory of effective demand (at the macroeconomic level) and Sraffa's classical Ricardian theory of value (at the microeconomic level). Garegnani held chairs at at Sassari (1962), Pavia (1966) and Florence (1970), before settling down in Rome-La Sapienza in 1974.  He was literary executor of Sraffa after the latter's death in 1983.  Garegnani was a frequent visiting professor at the New School during the 1980s.  In 1992, Garegnani became professor of economics at the newly-founded University of Roma Tre.

Joseph Garnier, 1813-81,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/garnier.htm," French liberal journalist and economist (not to be confused with Comte Germain Garnier) Originating from a humble farming family in the environs of Nice (southern France).  Joseph Garnier enrolled in 1829 at the Ecole Supérieure du Commerce, and became a protegé of Adolphe Blanqui (who would later become his father in law).  At Blanqui's recommendation, Garnier stayed on as a teacher there, and simultaneously launched a parallel career as a journalist, writing primarily economic pieces. In 1835, Joseph Garnier rose to became editor of Le National, the famous liberal newspaper launched by Adolphe Thiers and historian François-Auguste Mignet back in 1830, that had played such an important role in the July Revolution. In 1841, Garnier and the publisher Guillaumin launched the Journal des  économistes, the first European journal dedicated to economics proper.  The next year, Garnier became a founding member of the Société d'Économie Politique and its annals (Annuaire de l'économie politique) in 1844.  Garnier helped later found the more politically-active Association pour la liberté des échanges (with Bastiat), and its associated journal Libre échange and later on (1848) the newspaper Jacques Bonnehomme to promote the cause of free trade and laissez faire. In 1846, Garnier became the first professor of economics at the École des Ponts et Chaussées, the old citadel of the engineer-economists. In 1876, Garnier became a senator in the French parliament.      Major Works of Joseph Garnier   Resources on Joseph Garnier   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Comte Germain Garnier, 1754-1821,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/comtegarnier.htm,"French aristocrat and politician, late Physiocrat, monetary economist. Germain Garnier is probably best remembered as the main French translator of Adam Smith, and one of the progenitors of the French Liberal School. Born in Auxerre to a notable family and trained in law, Germain Garnier had some entry into the court of Louis XVI.  He was a delegate for Paris to the Estates-General of 1789.   A constitutional monarchist, Garnier defended property qualifications for electoral suffrage in his anonymous 1792 tract. With the rise of the terror in 1793, Garnier fled to Switzerland, returning only with the installation of  Directory in 1795  (to which Garnier was a candidate in 1797, but failed to obtain a position).  It was at this time that Garnier published his first economics work, his 1796 Abrégé, which demonstrated Physiocratic influence and seemed build upon Cantillon (although the latter is not cited).  His ""income pyramid"" relating income and prices to quantity demanded can be conceived as a primitive demand function, and was later taken up by J.B. Say. After the Bonapartist coup, Garnier was appointed prefect of the department of Seine-et-Oise in 1800.  In 1802, Garnier produced a French translation of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations.  This was the third French translation (after Abbé Blavet's and the poet Roucher's), but probably the best and most popular one.  The preface included a long disquisition comparing Smith to the Physiocrats, arguing that while Smith was superior and doubtlessly more useful, the Physiocrats were not themselves wrong either.  The fifth volume contained Garnier's extensive notes on the treatise.  Garnier's preface and notes were arguably the first significant review of Adam Smith's economics in any language, a quarter century after its first appearance.  Garnier's preface was subsequently translated and frequently appended to English editions of Smith's treatise. Garnier expanded the preface for the 1822 edition. Comte Garnier's translation was revised by Adolphe Blanqui in 1843 and then again by Joseph Garnier in 1859. Garnier was appointed senator by Napoleon in 1804, elevated to count (comte) in 1808 and made president of the senate in 1809.  With the Bourbon restoration in 1814, Garnier was elevated to a peerage and appointed to the Chamber of Peers by the Bourbon king Louis XVIII, where he made a name for himself as an expert on money and finance, although his main scholarly interest was in ancient money.  Garnier was subsequently made a member of the council of state and privy council, and, in 1817, elevated to marquis.

Pierre Gassendi, 1592-1655,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/gassendi.htm," Brilliant Provençal priest, scientist and philosopher.  Pierre Gassendi is best-known as an advocate and popularizer of the doctrines of the ancient Epicurean School.  He advanced Epicurean ""atomism"" as the basis of a new physical and social science (although he cautiously wrapped the heretical doctrine with layers of Christian tinsel and a modest skepticism).   Gassendi broke into print in 1624 with a direct assault the Aristotelian ""logical"" methods of reasoning that had been the exclusive tool of the Scholastics.  Like his contemporary Francis Bacon, Gassendi insisted on the need to base knowledge on empirical evidence -- and showed (paradoxically) how empirical exceptions could always punctuate logical arguments, no matter how tight.  Although very influential and widely toasted in his youth, Gassendi's empiricist doctrines would soon be challenged by Descartes's rationalist revolution.    Gassendi redirected his guns from the Scholastics to the Cartesians in several works (e.g. 1641, 1644), but was largely unsuccessful.  Gassendi was doomed to oblivion in France.   However, in England, Gassendi's doctrines flowed on (he was an important influence on Newton).  Gassendi's claim as one of the fathers of the ""Scientific Revolution"" of the 17th Century cannot be assailed.    It is Gassendi's resurrection of the Epicurean ethical doctrine of hedonism (esp. in his Syntagma) that most interests us here.  Setting issues of faith to the side, Gassendi asserted that in other spheres of life, the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain is the ultimate virtue.   He appealed to psychological ""evidence"" to support the idea that Divine Providence was involved in this (Would God have hotwired pleasure and pain into our sensations, had he not wished us to follow them?)   However, like Epicurus before him, Gassendi realized that his hedonistic doctrine could easily be (mis?-)interpreted as an excuse for sensual and material pleasure-seeking (France had just emerged from forty years of religious strife -- expressions of such impiety were still dangerous).  To sidestep this, Gassendi placed the emphasis on our reasoning.  More precisely, Gassendi actually defined ""reason"" as the ability to distinguish what is ""truly"" pleasurable and what is ""truly"" painful -- and defined ""virtue"" as the ability to mold our actions to achieve those ends. But what does ""truly"" mean?  Like Epicurus, once again, Gassendi defines a ""true"" pleasure as one which is of high quality and long-lived (as opposed to intensely, short-lived ""fun"").  This part of the argument is also substantiated by Divine Providence: would God have given us the ability to ""reason"" had he not wished us to use it?   Interestingly, Gassendi applied his doctrine to social philosophy.  In particular, he noted it is in the ""true"" interest of the hedonistic man to secure the means to long-lived pleasure, i.e. he needs to stay alive as long as possible, be able to hold to his property, etc.  In a Hobbesian lurch, Gassendi says that it is thus ""reasonable"" for men to support any government which is strong enough to end strife and secure people and property while at the same time giving people the liberty to pursue their own interests and passions.  Interestingly, Gassendi plumps down in favor of a single centralized power (rather than letting power be diluted by checks-and-balances constitutionalism) as the most effective means of achieving this.  He recognizes the potential for abuse -- and thus emphasizes the importance of ""enlightening"" the king (i.e. make him realize that his self-interest is not in tyranny).  Gassendi looks to the great hero of his youth, King Henry IV of France, as the example to follow.  Gassendi's defense of absolutism endeared him to Cardinal Richelieu, who engineered his appointment to the Royal College in Paris in 1645.

Simon Peter Gasser, 1676-1745.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/gasser.htm," Prussian Cameralist, and the first professor of political economy in Germany. Gasser was administrator in Cleves. Rewarded by Frederick William I of Prussia with a chair of law at Halle in 1721. Frederick William was interested in recruiting civil administrators from the universities.  Gasser and Johann Peter Ludwig, the rector of Halle, persuaded the king to overhaul the study of economics in German universities.  In 1727, Gasser was appointed to the first chair on economics in Germany - formally, professor of Oeconomie, Policey und Cammersachen, at the university of Halle (another chair was created that same year at Frankfurt-am-Oder for J.C. Dithmar).  The Halle chair was initially housed in the prestigious law faculty.   Gasser selected the classic treatise of Seckendorff as the first textbook.  In 1729, he published his own economics lectures. Upon Gasser's retirement in the 1740s, the new king Frederick II ('the Great') of Prussia, who, unlike his father, disdained the 'science of farmers' and didn't believe it a fit subject for universities, relegated the Halle chair from the law faculty to the philosophy faculty, and appointed a relatively minor figure, Joseph Friedrich Stiebritz, a Lutheran theologian and professor of Hebrew,  to the chair.

Edwin F. Gay, 1867-1946,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/gay.htm,"  American economic historian at Harvard, Detroit native from a wealthy background. After schooling in Switzerland and undergraduate training at Michigan (B.A. 1890), Gay went on a twelve-year tour of Europe (Leipzig, Gottingen, Zurich, Berlin, London). In 1902, he got a Ph.D. from University of Berlin, under Gustav Schmoller.  Upon his return to the United States that same year, Gay was appointed assistant professor in economic history at Harvard, replacing the departed William J. Ashley. He became full professor in 1906 and, in 1908, was tapped by President Eliot to become the first dean of Harvard Business School.  Gay took leave when war broke out in 1917 to serve on the War Trade Board. Gay helped found the National Bureau for Economic Research (NBER) and became its first president in 1920. E.F. Gay also was a founding member of the Council of Foreign Relations and helped launch Foreign Affairs. In 1919, Gay became the president and then editor of the New York Evening Post.  He returned to teach at Harvard in 1924. From this time, Gay also joined Wesley C. Mitchell as director of research at the NBER, which he would continue until 1933. Gay helped found the Journal of Economics and Business History in 1928. He was offered Taussig's chair after 1935, but, instead, E.F. Gay resigned and took up a research position at the Huntington Library.   Although he published very little, E.F. Gay trained numerous economic historians and was an important voice in the Harvard economics department.  He was succeeded by A.P. Usher.      Major Works of Edwin F. Gay     Resources on Edwin F.

Antonio Genovesi, 1712-1769.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/genovesi.htm," Italian philosopher and economist. Antonio Genovesi was professor of ethics and philosophy at the University of Naples.  In 1754, Genovesi was appointed professor in ""commerce and civil economics"" at Naples -- arguably the first academic chair in economics in Europe.   Antonio Genovesi has been regarded as the leader of the ""Neapolitan"" branch of the Enlightenment.  His 1765 lectures on economics effectively lays out the Italian tradition -- combining a utility-based theory of value, utilitarian ethics and permitting a role for the State in economic analysis.  Genovesi introduced a mathematical formula where value was equal to demand divided by the volume of consumable goods.  Highly influential upon Galiani.

Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen,1906-1994.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/georgescu.htm," One of the most remarkable and profound thinkers in modern economics - and one of the few whose reputation and influence, despite relative neglect over his lifetime, has only increased over time and promises to keep on increasing. Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen was trained in mathematical statistics at Bucharest and the Sorbonne - receiving his Ph.D at 24. In the 1930s, he spent three years at Harvard, where he was apprenticed in economics by Joseph Schumpeter.  Georgescu-Roegen played an instrumental role in the Paretian revival, immediately putting his mark on this new field with a few outstanding papers on producer and consumer theory (1935, 1936) - which included a solution of the ""integrability problem"" as well as a criticism of the revealed preference-derivation of utility (""where is indifference?"", he asked). He also set forth propositions on stochastic choice and lexicographic preferences. After returning to Bucharest, Georgescu-Roegen took on official duties for the Romanian government, including a position in the post-war negotiations with the Soviet Union. In 1948, Georgescu-Roegen fled Communist-controlled Romania, stowing himself and his wife away in barrels aboard an Istanbul-bound freighter. Georgescu-Roegen made his way back to the United States, finally settling at Vanderbilt University - finding the time, in the meanwhile, to contribute three seminal chapters to the celebrated Koopmans-edited 1951 Cowles monograph on linear programming and general equilibrium theory. There, we find several contributions - including the independent discovery of the Hawkins-Simon conditions, an alternative existence proof for von Neumann's system, the general laws of substitutability for Leontief systems and more. His ingenious contribution to the Marxian theory of crisis (1960) is also well-known. In 1966, Georgescu-Roegen bailed out of the Neo-Walrasian ship with a salvo of critical torpedoes - contained in the insightful and erudite introduction to his Analytical Economics (1966).  Reviewing the origins of early science, Georgescu-Roegen forwards two provocative propositions: firstly, that ""theoretical science"" necessarily deals with ""arithmomorphic"" concepts (i.e. phenomena having properties similar to numbers) which permits logical ordering of propositions; secondly, that as economics deals with non-arithmomorphic concepts, because economic conceptions (and their opposites) overlap and because ""qualities"" are as essential as quantities in economics, then, consequently, economics cannot be a theoretical science -- or at least, not one which can be handled by the use of logic.  Dialectics is Georgescu-Roegen's preferred mode of analysis.  There, he also introduced his initial ideas on a new biological or evolutionary approach to economic theory. His ideas were further developed and consolidated in his magnum opus, The Entropy Law and the Economic Process (1971). Georgescu-Roegen's claims, among others, were that an economy faces limits to growth, for which he invoked the Second Law of Thermodynamics (""useful energy gets dissipated""). Although generally ignored by mainstream economics, he was hailed by the fledgling environmental movement and, until the end of his life, never ceased to speak out on his ideas for a new approach to economic theory. Today, his work is gaining influence, and his insights are being grafted into the new field of evolutionary economics.

Ephraim Gerhard, 1682-1718,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/gerhard.htm,"German Cameralist. Originating from Silesia, Gerhard Ephraim (or ""Gerhardus"") was a son of a Protestant pastor.  He studied theology at Wittenberg and Leipzig, then shifted to philosophy at Jena, obtaining his degree in 1704.  Gerhard published a small tract on the history of philosophy (1706), and another on logic (1709).  Gerhard eventually gave up philosophy to study jurisprudence under Christanus Thomasius, a natural law philosopher, lawyer and law professor at Altdorf and Jena.  Gerhard build upon Thomasius direction, producing works on natural law.  Gerhard is one of the first academics to bring the Cameralism into the university.  His brief 1713 tract is conceived as an introductory guide to the work of Seckendorff. Gerhard entered the service of the ducal court of Saxe-Weimar in 1709 and lectured at Jena.  He was appointed a professor of institutions at Altdorf in 1717, but died the next year at the relatively young age of 36.

Alexander Gerschenkron, 1904-78.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/gerschenkron.htm," Harvard economic historian and development theorist. Born and raised in Odessa, on the Russian Crimean coast, Alexander Gerschenkron and his father escaped on foot to Romania in 1920, finally making their way to Vienna.  Gerschenkron completed his education at the University of Vienna, where he was trained in the Austrian School tradition.  However, outside the classroom, Gerschenkron fell under the sway of Austro-Marxism.  His socialist leanings ensured his unemployment after obtaining his doctorate in 1928.  For the next ten years, Gerschenkron worked as a manager in a motorcycle factory, while pursuing his research interests on the side.  He taught at the People's University in Vienna from 1928 to 1931, was a research analyst with the Austrian Wholesale Cooperative Society until 1937.  Finally, during 1937-8, he worked under Oskar Morgenstern at the Austrian Business Cycle Research Institute.   Upon Hitler's invasion of Austria in 1938, Gerschenkron escaped overland to Switzerland and then, via the good offices of Charles A. Gulick of Berkeley, managed to make his way to America.  He worked for a while as a research assistant at Berkeley, moonlighting as a steelworker in a local shipyard.  In 1944, Gerschenkron followed  Howard S. Ellis to the Federal Reserve Board in Washington DC, where he would soon would take a prominent research position. In 1948, at Haberler's instigation, Alexander Gerschenkron obtained an appointment at Harvard, where he taught European economic history and Soviet economics. This time he did need to need to get another paying job -- although he still did recreational work as a critic of Russian literature.   His early research concentrated on development in Soviet Russia and Eastern Europe. In a celebrated 1947 article, he found the famous ""Gerschenkron effect"" (i.e. that changing the base year for an index determines the growth rate of the index). His early work (e.g. 1951), often pursued the statistical shenanigans of Soviet planners.  Gerschenkron was also a famous propounder of the ""linear stages"" theory of economic development, perhaps best demonstrated in his 1962 book. However, he did accept that different periods exhibit different types of development: for instance, with the coexistence of advanced and backward countries, that latter could skip several stages which the former had to go through by adopting their advanced technology.  The peculiar paths of industrialization of Meiji Japan and Soviet Russia were regarded as examples of this.  There is some advantages, Gerschenkron insisted, in industrializing late. Gerschenkron is generally regarded as the ""father"" of quantitative New Economic History. Through his students, he successfully created a ""school"" of around himself.  Gerschenkron had become one of the leading attractions at Harvard of the 1950s and 1960s.    He retired from Harvard in 1974.

Isaac Gervaise, 1680-1739.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/gervaise.htm,"French-born businessman in London, and liberal Mercantilist, or more properly, an early Enlightenment thinker. Isaac Gervaise was born in Paris to a French Huguenot silk-manufacturing family.  Upon the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, the Gervaise family went into exile.  They found their way to London, where Isaac's father Louis Gervaise, now a naturalized English citizen, had previously (c.1682) set up a new silk manufacturing business.  Isaac was naturalized in 1699 and eventually entered the family business. Isaac Gervaise's fame rests on a small but formidable 1720 tract,  merely thirty pages, his only publication.  It seems to be directed against John Law's system in France, which was then at its height.  In his tract, Gervaise explained in detail the self-balancing monetary mechanism of a multi-country system of international trade.  Gervaise seemed to believe that there was a ""natural"" distribution of money (""the grand Denominator"") among countries, which he asserts is scaled to population size (more precisely, GDP), and consistent with internal balance (keeping consumption balanced with production) and a zero trade balance.  Any disturbance in this natural monetary distribution will set in motion mechanisms that will automatically correct it. For example, in Gervaise's analysis, an accidental excess money supply in one country would drive up consumption demand (""Expence of the Rich"") above domestic production (""Labour of the Poor""), which can only be met by more imports and fewer exports  (unlike Hume,  Gervaise does not focus on rising prices, but has quantities do the adjusting directly; but the effect would be the same, as rising prices because of excess consumption demand would itself induce more imports and fewer exports).  In either case, excess domestic demand will cause a trade deficit.  These trade deficits would lead to an outflow of gold and silver specie to pay for it. That specie outflow will contract the money supply, and thus set everything in reverse (decline in consumption, falling prices, fall in imports, etc.) and restore both the domestic balance and international trade balance.  So excess money supplies are only temporary, and will be naturally drained out and domestic and international equilibrium restored. However, this latter part is only true if the supply of money is strictly tied to precious metal.  If the original money supply expansion was engineered artificially by bank credit or paper money, as in Law's system, then this no self-correction mechanism is hamstrung.   Excess credit would drive up consumption artificially, leading to trade deficits and specie outflow, but that outflow would not bring down the money supply and restore equilibrium gently.  Rather, the disequilibrium would continue, specie will drain entirely, until everything eventually come to a dangerous crash.  Gervaise's gives other more examples of more elaborate temporary disturbances, and works through how they would be corrected.  In several ways, Gervaise's vision of a self-correcting natural equilibrium system foreshadows that of  Richard Cantillon by a decade. - at least in its overall vision, in the belief in a self-correcting natural equilibrium state.   It some ways, it goes further than Cantillon and Hume and many later Enlightenment thinkers in the way it intricately ties domestic balance and international balance together in one system. Gervaise's belief in the natural distribution of money and natural equilibrium made him a strong opponent of artificial distortions - not only by Law's bank credit, but also by old Mercantilist government distortions of production and trade. Gervais'e takes a strong position in favor of laissez faire and free trade. ""This consider'd we may conclude, that Trade is never in a better condition, than when it's natural and free; the forcing it either by Laws, or Taxes, being always dangerous: because though the intended Benefit or Advantage be perceived, it is difficult to perceive its Countrecoup; which ever is at least in full proportion to the intended Benefit: Nature not yielding at once, sharpens those Countrecoups, and commonly causes a greater Evil, than the intended Benefit can ballance. Moreover, Trade being a tacit and natural Agreement, to give or furnish a Proportion of certain Denominations of Labour, to be drawn back in like Proportion, in such other Denominations, as best suits Necessity or Fancy; Man naturally seeks, and finds, the most easy and natural Means of attaining his Ends, and cannot be diverted from those Means, but by Force, and against his Will."" (Isaac Gervaise, 1720: p.17-18) Ironically, Gervaise's family business was the Royal Lustring Company, which itself had been granted an English government monopoly charter on the production of glossy silks (lustrings) in 1692. [Note: Isaac Gervaise the silk-manufacturer and writer of the tract, is sometimes conflated with another contemporary, Isaac Gervais (without the last ""e"").  This other Isaac Gervais was also of Huguenot descent, but he fled to Ireland (not London), and became an Anglican clergyman and a friend of Bishop George Berkeley,  It is almost certain these are different men.  By coincidence, Berkeley was an enthusiast of Law and a promoter bank credit.]      Major Works of Isaac Gervaise     Resources on Isaac Gervaise   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Franklin H. Giddings, 1855-1931.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/giddings.htm," American economist and sociologist.  Originating from Connecticut, Franklin H. Giddings started off as a journalist, before he began teaching at Bryn Mawr in Pennsylvania. Giddings was a member of the Columbia economics faculty from 1894 until the establishment of a separate sociology department in 1905.   Giddings is considered one of the founders of American sociology. In economics, F.H. Giddings was one of the early critics of Böhm-Bawerk's capital theory and a collaborator with John Bates Clark in the theory of distribution.  He got into a little methodenstreit with Simon N. Patten in the 1890s over the exact relationship between economics and sociology. In sociology, Giddings theory of  ""consciousness in kind"" has often been compared to the concept of ""sympathy"" in Adam Smith's theory of moral sentiments, and an early identification ""herd behavior"".

Charles Gide, 1847-1932.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/gide.htm,"Economist of the French historical school and socialist activist. Charles Gide was born to a prominent Huguenot family in southern France (he was the uncle of Andre Gide). He took his degree at Paris, with a dissertation on the legal rights of religious associations.  After the reorganization of the law faculties of France, in 1878, Gide took up the new chair in political economy at Bordeaux.  He would soon decamp for the law faculty at Montpellier, which would remain his perch for the next couple of decades.  Charles Gide simultaneously carved a career as a social activist. He would become a theoretician and proselytizer of ""Protestant socialism"" (a.k.a. as the ""Nimes School""), or, as he characterized it, the ""school of solidarity"", which he placed as the only tractable medium between the ""school of authority"" of Catholic socialism, the ""school of liberty"" of the classical liberals and the ""school of equality"" of revolutionary socialism.  Gide's activities in the Nimes circle brought him into contact with the cooperatives movement, which Gide quickly and wholeheartedly embraced and would become a lifelong advocate.  Charles Gide was a proponent of the historical approach to economics.  He was receptive of the work of Léon Walras, albeit less because of his economics and more because of their shared social philosophy.   With Walras's encouragement, Gide launched the influential Revue d'économie politique, as a heterodox counterweight to the publishing dominance of the French Liberal school.  Gide's 1883 Principes would become the leading principles textbook in France for a couple of generations, and his textbook on the history of economic doctrines with Charles Rist (1909) an international success.  In 1899, Gide began teaching social economics at the law faculty of Paris, resigning from his Montpellier chair in 1906 in favor of Charles Rist. While in Paris, Gide continued his tireless activities on behalf of the cooperative movement, authoring numerous newspaper articles and chairing about as many project committees on cooperatives, people's universities, garden cities, hygiene and more.  In 1921,  Gide breached the liberal citadel of the College de France, teaching courses there on the theory and history of cooperation, in a chair endowed by the cooperative societies.

Sir Robert Giffen, 1837-1910,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/giffen.htm," Scottish journalist, statistician and civil servant.  Born in Strathaven, Lanarkshire, and educated at the village school.  While apprenticed at a solicitor's office in Glasgow, he began attending university lectures, receiving only many years later (1884) an LLD from the university.  Attracted by journalism during a spell at the Stirling Journal, Giffen moved to London, where he took a job at the Globe in 1862.  In 1868, he became Bagehot's assistant at The Economist. Giffen wrote extensively on economic and financial subjects mainly, notably on indicators such as wage rates, economic growth, and national product.  A Manchester School liberal, Giffen was a fierce supporter of laissez-faire, pro-free trade and anti-bimetallism.  Having missed out on taking over The Economist after Bagehot's death in 1878, Giffen went on to found The Statist: a journal of practical finance and trade, which would serve as Economist's principal competitor for the next few decades. It was while working as a journalist that Giffen became heavily involved in the interpretation of economic statistics.  His was a leading member of the Royal Statistical Society (formerly the Statistical Society of London), serving as editor of their Journal from 1876 to 1891, President in 1882 and 1883 and received the Guy medal in 1894.  Simultaneously, Robert Giffen entered government service.  He was appointed chief of the statistical department of the Board of Trade in 1876, assistant secretary of the commercial department in 1882.  During this time, he served on numerous government commissions and presented evidence before parliament.  In 1893, Giffen become controller-general of the conjoined Statistical, Commercial and Labour departments until his retirement in 1897. Giffen is credited by Marshall for suggesting the possibility that, in the case of some inferior goods, the income effects are so strong that the law of demand may be violated. Actual examples of such ""Giffen goods"" are rare (e.g. the oft-mentioned case is that of the demand for potatoes in Ireland).

William Godwin, 1756-1836.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/wgodwin.htm," English anarchist and utopian political and social philosopher.  William Godwin was the husband of early feminist author Mary Wollestonecraft and father of Mary Shelley (writer of ""Frankenstein"" and wife of romantic poet Percy Byssche Shelley). William Goodwin's most famous work is his Inquiry concerning political justice (1793).  Goodwin came out of the Enlightenment tradition - particularly the work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau - which was profoundly optimistic about human nature but highly critical of human institutions. A profound optimist concerning human nature, Goodwin nonetheless recognized the exploitative nature of capitalism and proposed a utopian  restructuring of society whereby those who earn more than their basic needs would distribute the surplus to the needy.  In his famous 1793 plea for anarchy, Godwin posited that the pursuit of happiness is the only object of personal and social ethics.  In an utilitarian ethical leap, Godwin actually went on to argue that ""Justice"" requires the maximization of aggregate pleasure.  The roots of Godwin's thesis may be found in  Rousseau's 1754 discourse on inequality. Rousseau had identified the creation of private property as the moment when man transitioned from his calm, humble and pacific natural state into a selfish, snobbish and violent creature. Godwin followed up on that, and identified property as the root of civil laws which cause injustice and evils, oppression, servility, fraud, etc. Rousseau had identified this with civilization, and did not offer a practical solution. But Goodwin believed he could reverse that, that there was a practical way of constructing a human moral utopia and return man to his natural state. He would not abolish private property per se, but rather remove inequality in property. Once everyone had enough property, selfishness would disappear as a human motive, and with it an end to all conflict, vice, etc. In Godwin's utopia, human society would be a general shared benevolence. There would be no social distinction by occupation either  - everyone would happily share in light agricultural labor (in Godwin's estimate, about half-hour a day!)  His optimistic prognostics on the ultimate ""perfectibility"" of mankind by a re-ordering of society led Malthus to respond with his dismal essay on population.  Godwin's schemes for material benefit of poor would merely lead to a population explosion, nullify themselves and bring in a variety of moral and social evils.  Godwin's replies to Malthus (1801, 1821) salvaged his own thesis using Malthus's own model.  Malthus had recognized this problem did not exist among the middle classes, who were more prudent in their procreation habits.  All the more reason, Godwin asserts, for property redistribution - make the poor non-poor, and they will acquire the habits of middle classes, redistributing property will ""solve"" the Malthusian problem.

Richard M. Goodwin, 1913-1996.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/goodwin.htm,"  Born in Newcastle, Indiana, to a lawyer-turned-banking family.   Although an artist by inclination, Goodwin enrolled at Harvard  in 1930 in the expectation of studying law and pursuing a career in his grandfather's bank.  However, the Goodwin family business was financially ruined during the Great Depression.  Seeking to understand the course of events, Goodwin switched to economics and eventually wrote his BA thesis on Marxism.  Goodwin proceeded to Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship to St. John's, but by his own recollection,  it was a not a particularly fruitful time.  He returned to the US in 1937, to pursue graduate studies at Harvard, and came under the spell of Joseph Schumpeter.  Goodwin obtained his Ph.D at Harvard in 1941, but had already been appointed instructor in economics in 1939.  During the war, with the absence of teachers, Goodwin was drafted to teach physics at Harvard.  Goodwin was appointed assistant professor of economics at Harvard in 1945.  By this time, Goodwin had begun his lifelong interest in the malfunctioning of capitalism and business cycles, constructing formal mathematical models, at first inspired by physics, later more by biology (notably adopting Volterra's predator-prey models for Goodwin's famous 1967 class struggle model). Goodwin was a pioneer in the development of endogenous cycles via non-linear dynamic models. Goodwin's theoretical outlook that can be described as a combination between Marxism and Keynesianism.  Denied tenure at the beginning of the McCarthy era, Goodwin left Harvard in 1949, and joined Cambridge University, at the invitation of Richard Stone, initially on a Rockefeller foundation grant.  He  would stay there, remaining a teacher at Cambridge from 1952 until 1980, when he became a professor at the University of Siena, Italy, until his retirement in 1984 Goodwin was also an accomplished artist and painter.  Anecdotes from his students report a an admiration for the way Goodwin could whip up beautiful, complex three-dimensional diagrams on the blackboard in an instant, which they they could only clumsily replicate in their notebooks.

In 1938, he joined the economics department at the University of California-Berkeley.  Aaron Gordon (he preferred to go by his second name) was arguably the leading figure in the Berkeley department until his retirement in 1976. R.A. Gordon was trained in the American Institutionalist tradition, and his two major works - on the corporation (1945) and on business cycles (1952) - were produced in that vein.  Nonetheless, Gordon embraced the Keynesian Revolution in many aspects.  Gordon sat on President Kennedy's commission on unemployment, and was the main author of its 1962 report. Gordon was a leader of the counter-reaction against the Monetarist upsurge in the 1970s   Gordon's main research focus was on unemployment and its measurement. Robert Aaron Gordon was the husband of economist Margaret S. Gordon and father of economists Robert J. Gordon and David A. Gordon, earning the Gordons the monicker ""the ""Flying Wallendas of economics"".      Major Works of Robert Aaron Gordon     Resources on  Robert A. Gordon   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

George J. Goschen, 1831-1907.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/goschen.htm," 19th C. English banker and statesmen. George Joachin Goschen (after 1900, Viscount Goschen) was born in London, the son of a German immigrant.  He had been named after his grandfather, a successful printer in Leipzig (Saxony), who had been involved with Goethe, Schiller, Wieland and other giants of Weimar Romanticism.  The publisher's third son (Goschen's father), Wilhelm Heinrich Göschen, then in his early twenties, went into partnership with a young Bremen merchant named Heinrich Frühling, and they moved to London together in 1814, to seek out their fortune.  They established the London commercial house of Fruhling & Goschen (the umlauts were dropped).  The commercial house prospered over the next few years, and Goschen senior eventually married an Englishwoman.  George Joachim Goschen was their eldest son. George Joachim Goschen was groomed by his father for the family business from an early age. Believing English schools were inadequate,  at the age of eleven, Goschen was packed off to school in Meiningen, Saxony for a few years.  Eventually Goschen senior decided to make an Englishman out of his son, and enrolled Goschen at Rugby School (where he came under mastership of Bonamy Price).  Goschen flourished at Rugby, and subsequently went to enroll at Oriel College, Oxford.  Goschen achieved a double first in classics and received his B.A. in 1853.  After graduating from Oxford, Goschen immediately entered into his father's commercial banking house of Fruhling & Goschen. In late 1854, Goschen was dispatched to Colombia, South America, to look after business interests there for a couple of years.  After his return, he got married.  Goschen took to the business with relish, his father yielding increasing responsibility over to him (Goschen senior was frequently absent abroad, in Germany).  The young Goschen rapidly acquired an impressive reputation in the City of London - the ""fortunate youth"", as he was labeled by other financiers. Goschen was made a director of the Bank of England in 1858, at the tender age of twenty seven. In 1861, Goschen published his most important economics work, The Theory of Foreign Exchanges.  The book was an instant classic and became authoritative handbook in the field of international finance  Although Goschen had not really read any economics (save for  ""Aristotle and Mill"", 1905: p.viii), Goschen grasped the principles of demand-and-supply intuitively and applied it to financial markets.  This is arguably the first book to explain in detail how the Bank of England could actively use its discount rate to protect gold reserves and control credit in the real economy- the beginnings of ""monetary policy"", as it were. Goschen explained how raising the Bank's discount rate will attract foreign funds, and eventually lead to a credit contraction at home, driving down domestic prices, boosting exports and diminishing imports, thereby turning the balance of trade in Britain's favor and thus inducing an inflow of gold bullion.   Although Goschen himself was a liberal and a firm believer of laissez faire, he admitted the reality of business cycles and recommended that the Bank of England adjust its own interest rates vigorously (at least by an increment of  1%, (1861: p.130-31), with the eye to ""correcting"" the economic conditions.  This significant interference in the markets led some doctrinaire liberals to raise an eyebrow (Goschen promptly reassured them with some hand-waving in the second edition of 1863, p.131). Nonetheless, Goschen's recommendation was apparently adopted by the Bank of England.  It would be later applauded by Bagehot, and become basically the orthodox monetary view in Britain for years (indeed, until challenged by Keynes in the late 1920s). In 1863, Goschen was persuaded to by fellow bankers to run for a parliamentary seat that had been opened in the City of London.  Goschen was elected as a member of the liberal Whig party.  A strong supporter of the Liberal government of Viscount Palmerston, Goschen was a near-doctrinaire defender of classical liberalism in virtually every vote (although he was chastised by Cobden and Bright over his support for British participation the Schleswig war in 1864).  Goschen spearheaded the effort to open the universities of Oxford and Cambridge to religious minorities.  In November 1865, Goschen joined the Liberal government of Lord John Russell as of Vice-President of the Board of Trade, hoping to make use of his commercial expertise, and two months later (January 1866) was moved to the post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, allowing him to participate in Russell's cabinet.  Busy in government affairs, Goschen resigned from his business duties in Fruhling & Goschen and thereafter Goschen remained focused on a political career.  After the fall of Russell's government in the summer of 1886, Goschen allied closely with William Gladstone, the new Liberal leader.  When Gladstone became prime minister in December 1868, Goschen was appointed to head the Poor Law Board.  In a notorious 1869 article, (""Goschen minute""), Goschen expressed concern that the 1832 Poor Law Reform had been ineffective, and there was growing abuse of outside relief.  This led to another reform in 1871 which transferred responsibility for the administration of poor relief to the Local Government Boards, creating a more professional and less-haphazard welfare system.  Goschen moved to the Admiralty in March 1871, and undertook major reforms in the British navy, before the fall of Gladstone's government in early 1874.  Goschen submitted proposals for local tax reform in Britain, but these were less well-received.    In 1876, while the Liberals were still in opposition, Goschen was recruited by a group of British creditors to travel to Egypt (along with French counterpart Joubert) to inquire into the financial situation of Egyptian government.  Falling into fiscal straits, the Egyptian khedive Ismail had suspended interest payments on Egyptian bonds the prior year.  Goschen's report led to the beginning of the ""Dual Control"" system over Egypt - Egyptian debt was consolidated, but a new institution created, the Caisse de la Dette Publique, with European controllers (British and French), to ensure debt service was maintained.  Goschen began his break with the Liberals in 1880, over the issue of electoral franchise, feeling that proposed parliamentary reforms were going to place government entirely in the hands of merely one class. He was also suspicious of increasingly aggressive younger Liberals like Joseph Chamberlain, whom he felt were departing from classical liberal principles.  When Gladstone returned to power in 1880, Goschen reluctantly agreed to serve as ambassador in Constantinople for a spell, but Goschen otherwise refused to accept any other government posts offered to him.  Losing his parliamentary borough of Ripon in the reform of 1885, Goschen won a seat in east Edinburgh, effectively as an independent candidate. Many of his political speeches were unusually apolitical, and discussed high-minded topics, such as education reform.  Education remained a lifelong concern for Goschen, and he was a significant promoter of University Extension and the push to include economics in curriculums. In 1886, Goschen finally split from Gladstone's Liberals over Irish Home Rule, and became one of the leaders of the schismatic Liberal Unionists.  Although successful in defeating the Home Rule Bill,  Goschen's vocal unionist position led to the loss of his Edinburgh seat in 1886 elections.  Nonetheless, Liberal Unionists had won the election overall in coalition with the Conservatives, and Goschen was offered the high position of Chancellor of the Exchequer by the Conservative Prime minister Lord Salisbury on 20 December, 1886 (although unable to work in parliament initially, Goschen eventually won a seat in a London by-election in February 1887). George Goschen served as Chancellor of the Exchequer for six years, from 1886 to 1892.  It was a relatively successful tenure, Goschen managing to reduce the national debt and cut interest payments considerably.  The biggest challenge of this period was managing the Baring Crisis of late 1890, and the short but severe recession which followed.   In a speech at Leeds in 1891, citing the shortfall of gold reserves, Goschen famously made a proposal to allow the Bank of England to issue £1 notes to substitute the gold sovereign (by the prior banking acts, its lowest denomination note was £5 notes), thereby, allowing the Bank to mop up some estimated £30m worth of gold that was needless circulating as coinage in the British empire.  Although well-received in several quarters, the scheme was not taken up. Goschen somehow found time during this tenure as Chancellor to serve as president of the Royal Statistical Society in 1886-8.  He went on to become the first president of the Royal Economic Society in 1890 (then called the British Economic Association), a post he held until 1906. After the fall of the Salisbury government in August 1892, Gladstone's Liberals resumed office and promptly introduced a second home rule bill.  By now, Goschen had formally joined the Conservative Party in opposition.  In 1895, the Conservatives Salisbury returned to power, and Goschen was assigned the Admiralty.  In his second tenure at the Admiralty, Goschen presided over a large increase in British naval strength.  This became particularly acute after Germany entered the naval race in 1898.  Feeling the new challenge required more energy than he had - his increasing age and the death of his wife in 1898 had shaken him - Goschen decided to resign in October 1900, and retire from public life.  Goschen looked on for a leisurely but still active retirement.  Raised to the peerage as ""Viscount Goschen"" in 1900, he looked toward a quiet period in the House of Lords.  He spent much of his time outside politics, collecting his essays and and taking up the Chancellorship of Oxford University in 1903.  But this was interrupted by Joseph Chamberlain's proposal to revive protectionist tariffs in 1903.  Goschen leaped out of retirement into the forefront of the effort to defeat Chamberlain's proposals and in defense of free trade. This campaign would drag out until 1906. Goschen emerged victorious, but exhausted.  He died shortly after, in February 1907.      Major Works of George J.

Hermann Heinrich Gossen, 1810-1858.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/gossen.htm,"  Prussian civil servant, and forerunner of the Marginalist Revolution of 1871-74. Hermann Heinrich Gossen was born in Duren (near Aachen, then part of the French-occupied Prussian Rhineland).  Raised in a devout Catholic family, his father was a civil servant and an authoritarian figure in Gossen's life.  Young Gossen had shown an early interest in mathematics in high school, but was compelled by his father to study law.  After completing his school-leaving examination in 1829, Gossen dutifully enrolled in the University of Bonn to study law and administration. He had a study year at Berlin, before returning to Bonn in 1931. Gossen read economics as part of the cameralist component of his studies.  This would have been introduced to Gossen by Johann Gottfried Hoffmann (an early Historicist) at Berlin and/or Peter Kaufmann (an Adam Smith enthusiast) at Bonn.  It was possibly in connection with his legal studies that Gossen first came across the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham (Bentham was translated into German in 1833). To graduate from university and enter the civil service, students like Gossen had to submit an examination thesis (referendariat)  Gossen's submitted four essays  in February 1834 at Bonn, one historical (on the formation of the Prussian state), one juridical, one in political science (on the attributes of sovereignty) and one in cameralist economics (on the impact of fiscal structure on State credit).   The thesis questions were imposed in advance, and Gossen's answers, particularly on the last two, were somewhat heterodox, preferring to construct an elaborate logical-deductive argument than the commonly expected historicist answers.  Nonetheless, he passed, and entered the Prussian civil service as a law clerk in Cologne later that year.  Gossen did not take to the life of a bureaucrat. His practical training years winding down in 1841, and a second examination looming, Gossen made up his mind to quit the civil service, return to university, and start an academic career.  But once again, Gossen was overruled by his father.  In 1841, while preparing for his second examination, Gossen moved from Cologne to Bonn, to take care of his elderly father (who had retired there).  Gossen took the opportunity to attend lectures on mathematical astronomy being given by Friedrich Argelander at the University of Bonn, an experience he would always recall with relish (and, it should be noted, the only mathematics he would have seen since high school).  This distraction may have led him to interrupt his second examination - he completed the main examination in 1842, but only got around to completing the rest of it a couple of years later.  Finally passing in 1844, Gossen was appointed as a government tax assessor dispatched to Magdeburg.  He was later transferred to Erfurt (possibly after a quarrel with his superiors). Gossen's father died in October 1847.  One month later, Gossen quit the civil service, and moved to Berlin. He does not seem to have taken a job, but lived on his savings and his recent inheritance.  A political liberal, Gossen was excited by the 1848 revolution in Berlin, but it is unclear what activities (if any) he was involved in.  Later that same year, Gossen was talked into a business scheme with a Belgian associate to establish a universal insurance company.  The plan was to build a general company up piecemeal, division by division.  Gossen moved to Cologne to launch the divisions on livestock and hailstorm insurance.  But the business failed by 1850.  Gossen remained in Cologne, living with his widowed mother and a spinster sister, while preparing his grand economics treatise.   Finished by January 1853, he had a hard time finding a publisher.  It only came out in in late 1854, published by a Brunswick printer (largely at Gossen's expense, with a Cologne lawyer named Meyer underwriting the rest of the cost). Gossen's economics treatise, in which he had rested great hopes to revolutionize the field, was met with silence.  Nobody took notice of it.  Gossen was crushed.  Already suffering from typhoid infection he caught in 1853, Gossen realized he had probably not long to live and his one bullet to immortality had misfired.  Embittered, Gossen did not touch economics again.  Instead, he turned to music (Gossen was a talented violinist), and set about constructing a mathematical theory of music.  It was never finished.  Gossen's health deteriorated, and he finally died on February 13, 1858. Gossen died bitter and unknown. Just before his death, he ordered the destruction of all copies of his 1854 treatise (they were pulled from stores, but as we shall see, not destroyed).  The first known mention of Gossen treatise appeared later that year, in a footnote about a recent work of  a certain ""Friedrich"" Gossen, by Julius Kautz in his Theorie der geschichte der Nationalökonomie (1858, p.9), but it was not followed up.  The next mention would only come a dozen years later, in a footnote in the second edition of F. A. Lange's Die Arbeiterfrage (1870 2nd ed, p.124; 1875 3rd edition, p.124). Gossen's work was finally uncovered when a single copy was found at the British Museum in 1878 by Robert Adamson, a professor of philosophy of Owens College, Manchester, who had been tracking down the Kautz footnote for years.  Adamson informed his colleague W. Stanley  Jevons, who realized its importance and promptly informed Léon Walras that they had both been anticipated by Gossen.  The priority of Gossen's contribution was acknowledged by Jevons in the second (1879) edition of TPE.  Walras composed an article on Gossen for the Journal des economistes in 1885 (p.68).  Gossen's book was reprinted in 1889 (actually, not a new printing run - just the undestroyed copies of the 1854 run under a new printer's cover).  Despite increased interest, dissemination was still limited.  Walras claimed to have undertaken a French translation of Gossen's book himself, but it never saw the light of day. An English translation was not available until 1983. Gossen's 1854 treatise was divided into two parts - the first to pure theory, the second to applied economics.  Unlike many other proto-marginalists, Gossen was conscious of the revolutionary nature of his work, and immediately likened himself to Copernicus (p.v). He begins his book articulating a philosophical confession of faith in utilitarianism (p.1), and declares his assumption that man seeks to maximize pleasure and minimize pain, , before getting around to the task of determining the laws of value.  Gossen lays out the idea of diminishing marginal utility (p.4) and draws the now-familiar diagrams of diminishing marginal utility (p.8-9).  Gossen does not use the term ""utility"", but various euphemisms like ""magnitude of satisfaction"" (Größe der Genüsse), which needs to be interpreted from context whether he means total or marginal utility.  He eventually settles on the term  ""value of the last atom"" (""Werth der letzten Atom"")  for marginal utility (e.g. p.29, p.84) It is common to reduce Gossen's theoretical section to two ""Gossen's Laws""  The labels ""Gossen's First Law"" and ""Gossen's Second Law"" were originally given by Wilhelm Lexis (1895, p.422).  Friedrich Hayek (1927) added a third Gossen's law, although its exact statement is looser Gossen endeavored to find these ""laws"" in all sorts of economic activities. He can be credited with a disutility theory of labor supply, anticipating William Stanley Jevons.  Gossen's attempt to apply the utilitarian philosophical calculus to his theory led him to argue that the market exchange outcome also maximized social utility -- a conclusion which later earned him a sharp rebuke from Léon Walras (1874 [4th ed.]: p.204-5). Because of its abstract, universalist and mathematical nature, Gossen's work was utterly disparaged by scions of the all- powerful German Historical School (Schmoller dismissed Gossen as an ""ingenious idiot"").   The pretentious tone of his work, wherein he compared himself to Copernicus, probably did not help garner sympathy.  But all of this commentary came later, because no one was really aware of Gossen's work during his lifetime.

Jacques-Claude-Marie Vincent de Gournay, 1712-1759.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/gournay.htm,"  French Enlightenment official and influential anti-Mercantilist free trade liberal. Although Vincent de Gournay did not really write anything beyond translations and letters,  his personal influence on Enlightenment economists in general -- and the Physiocrats in particular -- have secured him a place in the history of economics.  He was born Jacques-Claude Vincent in Saint-Malo, Brittany, son of a prominent local businessman.  At the age of 17, his father sent him, on his own reconnaissance, to Cadiz, Spain to learn the art of commerce.   The serious-minded boy applied himself conscientiously to his trade and, in his spare time, devoured contemporary tracts on political economy.  He was particularly entranced by the works of the English Mercantilist Josiah Child (whom he later translated) and memoirs of the Dutch statesman, Jan de Witt.  Gournay was also aware of Cantillon's as-yet-unpublished Essai. In 1744, Gournay left Cadiz and took a trip across Europe, partly on business, but also to learn more about the the state of commerce and administrative practices of other countries.  The great commercial nations - Hamburg, Holland, England - were all on his itinerary. While in France, he made the acquaintance of Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux (Count of Maurepas), the secretary of state for the Navy and the King's Household.  For the remainder of his journey, Gournay reported back to the French minister his observations.     In 1746, a close friend and business partner Jamet de Villebarre, died and, having no family, left Jacques-Claude Vincent his entire estate.  Included, in this unforeseen inheritance were lands in the region called ""Gournay"" in France (thus, after ennoblement, his surname would become ""Vincent de Gournay""; note: Schelle points out his noble title was 'Marquis de Gournay', but Turgot reports it merely as Seigneur de Gournay).  It was a nice region and the fortune was not insubstantial, so Vincent de Gournay decided to cut short his trip and settled down in France in 1748.  However, not wishing to see such a talented man idle, the Count of Maurepas convinced him to enter public service.  Vincent de Gournay became a counciller in the Grand Conseil (a type of arbitration court in Paris) in 1749 and married around the same time.  The Count of Maurepas  fell in disgrace in 1749, after writing a frivolous epigram about the powerful Madame de Pompadour.  But Gournay soon found a new patron in  Machault d'Arnouville, his boss at the Grand Conseil, and contrôleur général (minister of finance).  In 1751, with d'Arnouville's support, Vincent de Gournay secured appointment as royal intendant of commerce.  This was a purchased office which has been estimated to have cost some 200,000 livres to acquire, and yielded an income of some 12,500 livres per year. Gournay had to pay for offices, staff and expenses out of his own pocket.  Gournay took to his job zealously.  An ardent free trader, Gournay railed against the internal and external restrictions on commerce in France, comparing them unfavorably with the more liberal regimes in England and Holland.  [Note: Machault d'Arnouville was a close friend of René de Voyer, Marquis d'Argenson, a free trade liberal, now retired from government.  D'Argenson reports a meeting  in 1755, characterizing Gournay as sharing his own views on the freedom of commerce ""to the furthest extent"" and ""applying himself marvelously""] In 1755-6, Gournay took the young Jacques Turgot with him on his official travels across France and impressed on him his views on commerce and economic policy and introduced him to the literature on political economy.  There is no doubt that Gournay was the single most important influence upon Turgot -- and the future great economist would later write a beautiful eulogy to his fallen mentor.   In his campaign to press for the lifting of restrictions, Vicente de Gournay adopted the maxim ""laissez-faire, laissez-passer"" (""let do, let pass), to which the flourish ""le monde va de lui-même"", (""the world goes on by itself"") is sometimes added.  Turgot suggests Gournay adopted it from a story (originally told in print by d'Argenson in 1751, but probably already circulating beforehand) relating to a meeting c.1680 between the great French minister Colbert and a monsieur Le Gendre, the leader of a delegation of merchants.  When Colbert asked what the French state could do for the great merchants, Le Gendre simply replied ""laissez-nous faire"" (""let us be"").  Although it is almost certain d'Argenson originated the laissez-faire maxim, it was Gournay's adoption and use of it that gave it its vogue, and as such the slogan became inextricably associated with Gournay thereafter. In 1758, Vincent de Gournay tendered his resignation as intendant, ostensibly to focus attention on his private businesses, which had been neglected during his bureaucratic period and had begun to flounder.  It is also possible that he was a pressured to resign by his ministerial masters, as a result of his liberal agitation and attacks on economic privileges.  Refusing offers of court positions, Gournay only requested permission to retain the title of honorary intendant, to allow him continued entry into the bureau of commerce.  The Marquis de Silhouette, who became contrôleur-générale in 1759, knowing the measure of the man, invited Gournay to attend his weekly conferences with his intendants and tried to lure him into accepting an official position as a royal commissioner.  But Vincent de Gournay fell ill in 1759 before he could take it up.  He died after a prolonged illness around the age of 47, the date of which is sometimes unclear [the obituary in the Aug 1759 issue Mercure, clearly states the death date is 27 June 1759, but for some reason it is sometimes cited as 1760]. DuPont du Nemours (1767) regarded Gournay, jointly with Quesnay, as the ""father"" of French economics. However close their policy positions might have been, in truth, Gournay held none of the agrarian-centric views of Quesnay or his Physiocratic sect.  Gournay's belief in laissez-faire came from the commercial point of view.   Dupont de Nemours (note in Ouevres of Turgot p.260) has offered up the following list of the members of Gournay's ""school"": and, finally, by remote connection, To this list, Posselt adds: More credibly, Schelle adds: We could add to this list (18) Pierre Louis Abeille, who collaborated with Gournay in setting up the Société d'Agriculture de Bretagne, and wrote a Corps d'observation on the state of the Breton economy under the direction of Gournay.  However, Abeille would soon become an ardent disciple of Quesnay.       Major Works of Vincent de Gournay There are no extant works of Gournay.

Benjamin Graham, 1894-1976.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/bgraham.htm," Benjamin Graham was a partner in a financial investment firm in the 1920s when, suddenly, it was ruined with the 1929 Wall Street Crash. Working part-time as a professor of finance at Columbia, Graham authored his wildly successful book on financial analysis, Security Analysis (1934) with David Dodd.  In this book, Graham laid out the principles of  ""value-oriented investment"", i.e. the use of fundamentals in guiding the valuation of securities.  This approach was further advanced in two other Graham classics, the Interpretation of Financial Statements (1937) and the Intelligent Investor (1949).  Graham's approach acquired an avid following in the financial community.  He was nicknamed the ""Dean of Wall Street"" and raised to almost mythic status among practitioners. As the Great Depression wore on, Benjamin Graham turned his attention to wider economic issues. Seeing the devastation of deflation on farmers, workers, and producers, exacerbated by the irrationalities of the Gold Standard, Graham produced his famous 1937 Storage and Stability. In it, Graham proposed the creation and maintenance of reservoirs of commodities to act as buffer stocks against general price deflation.  So urgent and foolproof did he believe this price-stabilization plan to be that he offered free copies of his book to anyone who asked. Benjamin Graham's propositions were taken up Frank D. Graham of Princeton, and made into a more general proposition about a commodity-reserve currency.   In World Commodities and World Currency (1944), Benjamin Graham  proposed an international ""Commodity Standard"", where macroeconomic policies would shift from the defunct gold standard to a more general basket of commodities. Making its round in the journals, Benjamin Graham's plan was sympathetically reviewed by such unlikely bedfellows such as J.M. Keynes, Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. Nicholas Kaldor resurrected Graham's propositions in his ""Bancor"" campaign after the 1960s and Robert E. Hall took it up more recently in the ""free banking"" surge.

Frank D. Graham, 1890-1949.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/fgraham.htm," Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Frank D. Graham initially initially studied at Dalhousie university in Canada.  Graham received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1920, producing a dissertation on international monetary economics under Frank A. Taussig. Frank D. Graham went on to become professor of economics and international finance at Princeton University from 1921 until his retirement in 1945.   Frank D. Graham's two early papers on international trade (1923, 1930) prompted a sort of revolution in both international trade theory and general equilibrium theory - or rather, united them. Criticising the consistent use of two-sector, two-country models to illustrate international trade proposition, Frank Graham proposed instead to verify whether the basic ""Classical"" or Ricardian theorems of international trade would be compatible with multi-country, multi-commodity, multi-sector trade - in short, could they be obtainable within what effectively was a general equilibrium model? It was in solving to ""Graham's Model"" that Lionel McKenzie (1954) introduced the first proof of existence of a general equilibrium via a fixed-point theorem. In later years, in conjunction with Benjamin Graham, Frank Graham became a proponent of the adoption of a ""commodity reserve currency"" (1940, 1941, 1943, 1946, 1948) replacing the single-commodity currency backing in force in the Gold Standard (which he criticized endlessly) with a basket of commodities. Much of this scheme tied in with Graham's work on the promotion of full employment, which he tied together in Social Goals and Economic Institutions (1948), a magnificent tome on political economy.

Jean J.L. Graslin, 1727-1790,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/graslin.htm," Jean Graslin was a receiver-general of taxes in Nantes, one of the great French Atlantic commercial ports and so perhaps a Neo-Colbertiste by instinct.   Graslin is most famous for his criticisms of the Physiocrats.  Graslin's anti-Physiocratic 1767 tract was submitted to an essay competition established by Turgot at the academy of Limoges on the incidence of taxation. The prize went to Saint-Peravy instead, but Graslin's critical essay was incisive enough to draw a response from Turgot (1767).  Graslin particularly berated the Physiocrats' concept of national income in produit net terms, insisting instead that national income ought to be measured in total product terms.  Graslin also insisted that the incidence of taxation did not necessarily fall on land rents, but could be shifted around to fall on consumers.  His duel with the Physiocrats  is followed up in his correspondence with the Abbé Baudeau (1776).   Unlike other French monetary theorists of the time, Graslin embraced the Quantity Theory, arguing that the value of money bears no relationship to the value of its metal.  The total value of money, Graslin argued, is necessarily equal to the total value of goods, consequently, as the value of goods in aggregate is constant, then the value of a money depends solely on the quantity of money pieces. Some economists regard Graslin as a member of the subjectivist proto-Neoclassical strand, for his insistence that the value of objects is not related to anything intrinsic in them, but to man and ""increases and decreases with the needs of man, and disappears with him"" (1767)      Major Works of Jean Graslin     Resources on Jean Graslin   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Gratian, ? -1160,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/gratian.htm," Italian Scholastic jurist and teacher at Bologna, Gratian was  the great compiler of Canon Law (Church law), and effective founder of that field. Next to nothing is known of Gratian's life.  We know merely that he was one of the earliest teachers in Bologna.  Legendarily at least, it is said Gratian was a monk in the Camaldolese monastery of St. Felix in Bologna, although there is little trace of that and he has alternatively been thought to be just a secular jurist in Bologna.  Not long after the recovery of Justinian's Corpus and the development of (Roman) Civil Law at Bologna, spearheaded by the jurist Irnerius, Gratian tried his hand at compiling canon (ecclesiastical) law, imitating much the same style and ambition.  Gratian's motivation may have also been influenced by political events.  Since the late 1000s, the Pope and Emperor had been engaged in a conflict over the right of investiture of bishops. Although this was temporarily resolved by the 1122 Concordat of Worms, the more general conflict over the competing jurisdiction and authority of Church and State was still smoldering.  The recovery of Justinian's Corpus, exalting the Emperor as the source of law, had assisted the imperial case.  Gratian may have sought to counterbalance it, and bolster the papal camp, compiling papal decrees and providing the Church with its own, no-less-magnificent body of law. Gratian was not the first to try his hand.  Earlier partial compilations of papal decrees had been attempted, such as the Decretum of Burchard of Worms (c.1023), the Collectio Canonum of Anselm of Lucca (c.1086), the Collectio Canonum of Cardinal Deusdedit (c.1086-7) and, perhaps most famously, the Panormia and Decretum of Ivo of Chartres (c.1115).  But Gratian outdid them all in comprehensiveness, organization and method. Gratian probably began this project sometime in the 1120s, and completed it  around 1140 (although early tradition states it was published in 1151, the most probable date is 1142).  The result was Gratian's great compendium Concordia discordantium canonum ('concordance of discordant canons'), better known simply as the Decretum Gratiani.  Using the Scholastic method, Gratian sorted through the Holy Scriptures, the writings of the Church fathers, papal letters and church council decisions, not refraining from pointing out inconsistencies and contradictions between authorities (in this, his method was undoubtedly inspired by Abelard). The resulting compendium was presented not as a codex of church law, but rather as a textbook for students, scholars, jurists and clerics.  Gratian's Decretum is divided into three parts

- 1. Ministeria, divided into 101 distinciones, deals with the main outlines of the law.  The first 20 distinciones are known as tractatus decretalium (general principles of canonical law).  Gratian opened with his famous distinction between natural law (ius naturale) and customary usage (mos):  ""The Human Race is ruled by two things: namely, natural law and usages. Natural law is what is contained in the law and the Gospel. By it, each person is commanded to do to others what he wants done to himself and is prohibited from inflicting on others what he does not want done to himself.""  (Dict. prec. D.1.c1) Gratian's identification of 'natural law' with the 'Golden Rule' (Matthew 7:12) departs from the definition in Justinian's civil code, which defines (from Ulpian) that natural law is what “nature teaches all animals,” (Justinian, Digest, 1.2) - 2 - Negotia, dealing with ecclesiastical administration, is set out in the form of disputations. It contains 36 causoe (causes, or imaginary cases), each of which gives rises to to a number of questiones, which are debated in Scholastic fashion. -  3. Sacramenta deals with sacraments and other sacred things, divided into 5 distinctiones. each of which contains dicta Graitani (maxims of Gratian) and canones from auctoritates: the canons of councils, decretals of the popes, texts of the Scripture or the writings of the Church Fathers). Gratian's Decretum started to be taught and used at Bologna in the 1140s, and, while practically treated as authoritative by canon lawyers and ecclesiastical courts for centuries to come, the Decretum was never given official force of law by papal bull.  In other words, the 'law' is contained in the original texts, and not in the transcriptions and words of Gratian's compendium. Indeed, using original texts, later scholars have corrected numerous errors and mis-transcriptions in Gratian's book.   The Decretum, however great its reputation, remained just a textbook.  In spite of this, Gratian's Decretum is considered the first volume of the Corpus Juris Canonici, or recognized body of canon law.  The other volumes are the Five Books of Decretals ordered by Pope Gregory IX and compiled by Raymond de Peñafort in 1234, the Liber Sextus of Pope Boniface XIII (1298), the Clementine Constitutions of Pope Clement V (1317), all three of which were given official force of law by papal bull (that is, the law is as stated in these compilations, and not in the original texts).  Two unofficial volumes, the Vingiti Extravagantes of Pope John XXII (1325) and the Extravagantes communes compiled by Jean Chappuis (1505), are frequently also considered part of the Corpus.  By and large, these volumes are just updates on Gratian's Decretum, that is compilations of papal decretals promulgated after 1140, although some of the volumes also added pre-1140 decretals and sources overlooked by Gratian in the original Decretum. The immediate effect of Gratian's Decretum was to separate canon law from theology, and thus congealing the specializations of the two great Medieval universities - with Bologna increasingly focused on civil and canon law, leaving Paris to claim high theology and philosophy. The definitive grand collection of glosses (marginal notes) of Gratian's Decretum was the Glossa Ordinaria compiled by Johannes Teutonicus around 1217, and revised by Bartholomew of Brescia c.1245..

John Graunt, 1620-1674,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/graunt.htm,"English politicial arithmetician, father of demographic and social statistics.  John Graunt, the son of a Hampshire draper, followed his father's profession and became a London haberdasher, pursuing his own education and intellectual interests in his spare time.  Graunt's business prospered and it was partly through his influence in the London guilds that his good friend, William Petty, was appointed to the chair of music at Gresham College in 1650.  Petty would return the favor later by easing Graunt's entry into the Royal Society. Graunt's business was ruined by the Great Fire of London in 1666 and he compounded his difficulties by converting to Catholicism late in life.   John Graunt's principle claim to fame is his authorship of the ground-breaking Natural and Political Observations...upon the Bills of Mortality, published in 1662.  Being a relative unknown, 'John Graunt' was widely assumed to be a pseudonym of William Petty and many historians since have perpetuated that misattribution.  But there is now little doubt that Graunt was the real author, although the project might very well have been proposed and outlined to him by Petty, and it is also possible that Petty may have had a hand in composing the preface and conclusion. Graunt endeavored to provide reliable estimates on the basis of scant data of mortality and birth rates, sex ratios, migration, life expectancy and causes of death.  His principle innovation was his use of large numbers logic, that is, the argument (then novel) that while all these things are mere chance in an individual, they are reliably steady in the aggregate. Moreover, Graunt showed, changes in the aggregate numbers can be scientifically explained, and can be the basis of useful predictions.  Among the more interesting insights gleaned from Graunt's work was the demonstration that death rates in London exceeded birth rates, and yet building rates were increasing, ""It is therefore certain that London is supplied with People from out of the Countrey"" (p.41-42).  A simple observation that could long be gleaned from watching the streaming vagabonds migrating from the country, to be sure, but never one quite backed up before by the power of data.

"John Gray, LL.D.", 1724-1811,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/johngray.htm,"British lawyer and late Physiocrat, critic of Adam Smith.    Not to be confused with the other John Gray (the Ricardian Socialist). John Gray, LL.D. wrote an anonymous tract in 1797 severely criticizing Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations and vigorously defending the older position of the French Physiocrats.  Published well after Smith's death, Gray attacks his treatment of productivity and agriculture in particular.  Gray confidently re-asserts that ""the principal and most essential cause of the prosperity of a state is the ingenuity and labour of its inhabitants exercised upon the fertility of the soil"" (1797 p.4).  He goes on to criticize Smith for crediting manufacturing as a contributor to national wealth and for confusing the distinction between productive and unproductive labor.  In Gray's estimation,  Adam Smith's “verboseness and ambiguity clearly show how a man of ability, when overlooking fundamental principles, may speculate upon the surface of things, without ever getting to the kernel."" (1797: p.15) Gray adds a couple of twists to the old Physiocratic doctrine.  In a codicil reminiscent of Mercantilism, Gray asserts that manufacturing labor is unproductive domestically, but can add to national wealth if the manufactured goods are exported (p.36).  Gray goes on to criticize the Physiocrats themselves for regarding the landlords as a useful class, that they are in fact ""a most unessential and burdensome class in society""  (p.51), that the their rents can and should be effectively taken by the State to pay for military expenditures.  Gray advocates a single tax on land (p.57ff).  Gray goes on to denounce Arthur Young for objecting to land taxes, embracing some of Smith's ideas, and for advocating high prices as a positive benefit.. Practically nothing is known of John Gray.  His work (but not name) was noticed by Marx and by Seligman.  The only clue to the author's name is from a 1797 review in the Gentleman's Magazine (p.858), which is followed up in a 1811 obituary (p.601).  It connects Gray with the lottery office in Somerset. The only other work definitely connected with this author is his 1798 Proposal, written at the height of the famine crisis, to establish state-established granaries (the author is anonymous, but identifies himself as the author Essential Principles).  The author notes that he had visited Ireland in 1763-64 in the capacity of private secretary to the Duke of Northumberland. Some reviews of Essential Principles identify him as ""Dr. Gray"" or ""John Gray L.L.D"", which suggests he is a lawyer.  He is very probably the same author as the 1802 Income Tax Scrutinized (which comes with Gray's name attached), which demands an adjustment of Pitt's Income Tax on much the same grounds and argument as the 1797 argument for the land tax.

John Gray, 1799-1883.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/gray.htm,"English Ricardian Socialist (not to be confused with earlier John Gray, the Physiocratic critic of Smith). Originally from Derbyshire, John Gray moved to London as a teenager, where he worked as a clerk in a counting house and trying to launch a commercial career, but was quite embittered by the experience.  In 1815, Gray moved to Scotland, to join an Owenite colony, but was disappointed there too.  He moved to Edinburgh at some point after.  Gray's death date is variously given as 1850 or 1883. John Gray's principal work is his Social System (1831). He was among the first to stress the human element in the destructiveness of competition.

Augusto Graziani, 1865-1944,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/graziani.htm,"Italian economist (not to be confused with his grandson and namesake). Augusto Graziani was born in Modena, and obtained his bachelor's degree at the University of Modena in 1886, with a thesis on the law of profit. Graziani subsequently worked as a lecturer and assistant professor at Modena, Forli and Siena.  Graziani was finally appointed to the chair of finance and business law at the University of Siena 1890, and in 1892, inherited the chair of political economy at Siena from Achille Loria, who departed that year for Padua. Graziani would remain in Siena, teaching nearly all the economics-related courses at the university for several years.  In 1899, Graziani moved to the University of Naples, where he would remain until his retirement in 1938.  Augusto Graziani would play a significant role in the dissemination of the Marginalist Revolution in Italy, although he was much more eclectic.  Although schooled in Classical economics (in the version of Luigi Cossa), Graziani was early  influenced by the Austrian school, and he would spend much of his career trying to reconcile historicism and marginalism.  In the 1890s, Graziani was a frequent contributor to the  Giornale degli Economisti crowd, alongside instiutionalists like Loria, and marginalist high theorists like Maffeo Pantaleoni and Vilfredo Pareto.  His 1893 GdE article on the economic theory of law, often hailed as a milestone of the ""law and economics"" movement. was very much influenced by his contemporary Achille Loria. A classical liberal by conviction, Augusto Graziani nonetheless tried to steer clear of politics, and stay strictly within the academy.  Unlike other contemporaries, Graziani did not flirt with fascism, and,  in one of his rare public stances, lined up with Benedetto Croce against it  Nonetheless, to retain his academic job, Graziani was obliged to swear an oath of loyalty to the Italian fascist regime, but accepted no other positions from them.

Sir Thomas Gresham, ?1519-1579.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/gresham.htm,"  Fabulously wealthy 16th Century English financier, merchant and statesman, principal economic advisor to Queen Elizabeth I of England. Descended from a notable family of Norfolk cloth merchants, who had relocated to London, Gresham's father had served as Lord Mayor of London for a brief period.  Abandoning his early studies at Cambridge, Thomas Gresham entered the cloth business himself, joining the Mercer's Company in London.  Around 1551, Gresham was appointed royal agent in Antwerp - essentially, manager of the English royal debt in European money markets - a position he would serve for sixteen years.  The time in Antwerp gave him also a direct view of the the economic impact of the 1550s debasements of English coin and the problems of English overseas cloth trade.   Gresham stressed the importance of stable coinage for export competitiveness and the management of public debt.  Gresham is best remembered for his dictum that ""bad money drives out good"", what became later known as Gresham's Law (Macleod, 1858: p.477)  This refers to the observation that the exchange ratio between gold and silver on the market may be different that the implicit gold-silver ratio at the Mint.  If they are indeed different, then the metal that is relatively overvalued at the mint (i.e. the ""bad money"") will be minted into coins and find its way into circulation, while the other undervalued metal (i.e. the ""good money"") will be melted down and hoarded away.  Although there is no evidence that Gresham actually ever made this observation, his name has become irrevocably attached to it because of his policies to control this phenomenon. In 1559 Gresham was knighted and was subsequently asked by the new Queen Elizabeth to come up with a plan to curb inflation in England (which had been raging since the Great Debasement of 1553) and arrest the slide of the value of the English pound on the Antwerp exchange market.  Gresham's solution was to recall and remint all the (debased) silver coinage of England at the old (pre-1543) rate of 37/40 pure silver -- in effect, a substantial monetary contraction. Previous holders of money received only a fraction of their earlier face value.  Although at great social cost, Gresham's stabilization plan ultimately worked and inflation was brought down to manageable levels.  Sir Thomas Gresham was an early Mercantilist, and urged the use of royal power to place English commerce in the hands of English merchants.  Gresham vigorously promoted the Society of Merchant Adventurers (English unfinished cloth exporters) at the expense of the German Hanseatic League, persuading first Mary, then Elizabeth, to raise customs duties (e.g. 1557) and reduce the export licenses for raw wool and unfinished cloth granted to Hansa merchants in the London Steelyard.  The Hanseatic League retaliated, using their influence to impose an embargo on English cloth imports into the Low Countries and Germany in 1563 (it lasted little over a year, after the English side-stepped the restrictions through the non-Hansa Friesland port of Emden and upped the ante by cutting off raw wool exports to Flanders).  The experience of the embargo allowed Gresham to promote schemes to strengthen the position of English traders.  He was instrumental in the reorganization of the Merchant Adventurers in 1564 along more oligarchic lines. In 1565, Gresham founded the Royal Exchange in London, a ""permanent fair"" to compete with the Antwerp Bourse.  In 1567, with the outbreak of the Dutch revolt, sensing the English merchant quarter in Antwerp was vulnerable to violent religious tumults and Spanish reaction, Gresham helped negotiate the establishment of an English merchant quarter in Hamburg as an alternative.  The value of the Hamburg option proved itself immediately in 1568, when, in a quarrel over a Spanish ship seized in Plymouth harbor, the Spanish Duke of Alba ordered all English property in Antwerp seized (Gresham left Antwerp at this point, never to return;  Elizabeth retaliated with the seizure of Dutch property in England and trade between England and the Low Countries ceased; but the export trade through Hamburg continued.) The Anglo-Hanseatic trade quarrel erupted anew in the 1570s.  With Gersham's encouragement, Elizabeth reduced export licenses further, and, in 1572, made a trade agreement with Charles IX of France and opened negotiations with Denmark to undermine the Hanseatic League.  In retaliation, the Hanseatic League tried to assemble a new embargo and, in 1576, ordered Hamburg to expel all English merchants. Gresham was among those that urged maintaining a hardline against the Hanseatic tactics, rather than relaxing the export restrictions.  This culminated in the famous 1579 decision by Elizabeth to end all export licenses and abolish all privileges to German merchants in London, ending centuries of the Hanseatic role in English trade (although their Steelyard property holdings would linger until 1597).  Gresham endorsed the chartering the English Eastland Company in 1579 to directly compete with the commerce of the Hanseatic League  in Scandinavia and the Baltics. Sir Thomas Gresham lived just long enough to see his anti-Hanseatic trade policy brought to its apex.  In his will, Gresham founded Gresham College, on the premises of in his London mansion at Bishopsgate.  It was an unusual institution of higher learning, which awarded no degree and took no students, but rather offered lectures free and open to the general public.  There were seven chairs endowed by Gresham according to a precise nomination procedure: the City Corporation of London would appoint the professors of Astronomy, Geometry, Divinity and Music, while the Mercers' Company would appoint the chairs in Law, Physic and Rhetoric.  Notably, the chairs of astronomy and geometry were the first in England, revealing Gresham's interest in the fledgling scientific revolution. The College would fulfill that promise in serving as the incubus of a particularly brilliant group of young scientists in the 1650s - including Robert Boyle, Christopher Wren, John Wallis, Robert Hooke and William Petty - who would go on to found the Royal Society on the premises in 1660.

Henryk Grossman, 1881-1950.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/henrykgrossman.htm," Born in Cracow, then in Austrian Galicia, to a prosperous Jewish family, Henryk Grossman was already an activist and organizer of the socialist movement in Galicia, before going on to study in Vienna in 1908. After 1918, Grossman became a Polish citizen, professor of economics at the Free University of Warsaw and member of the Polish Communist Party. Facing political difficulties, Grossman emigrated to Frankfurt, Germany in 1925, at the invitation of his former Vienna mentor Carl Grünberg. He fled Germany in 1933, proceeding through Paris and London to New York, where he remained for the duration of the war.  He returned to Europe, taking a position at Leipzig (East Germany) in 1949, but died shortly after. Henryk Grossman was one of the major revisionist thinkers during the Marxian debate on the theory of crises.  Grossman's most famous work (1929) on the breakdown of capitalism takes off from Otto Bauer's model of expanded reproduction.  Grossman showed that, with increasing organic composition of capital, capitalism is unable to produce enough surplus value and thus will eventually collapse.   Although Henryk Grossman is most often classified as an Austro-Marxist, he was also associated with the Institut für Sozialforschung in Frankfurt (and thus Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse and the ""Frankfurt School"" of Marxian sociology).  He wrote a couple of important historical studies on Sismondi.      Major Works of Henryk Grossman     Resources on Henryk Grossman   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

George Grote, 1794-1871,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/grote.htm," English banker, classical historian and utilitarian reformer. Scion of an Anglo-Dutch (via Bremen) banking family, George Grote's aspirations to a classical education were terminated by his father, who set him up on a career in his banking house of Prescott & Grote in London.  It was almost inevitable that the young banker encountered David Ricardo, who turned him towards political economy and introduced him into the circle of James Mill and Jeremy Bentham, and developed a life-long friendship with the young John Stuart Mill.   Grote was a founding member of the Political Economy Club (1821). George Grote embraced the utilitarian project and kicked into print with a vigorous promotion of the extension of suffrage (dependent on education) and parliamentary reform (1821).  Immediately afterwards, Grote was charged with editing  Bentham's 1770s writings against the 'natural religion' theory into a new treatise under a pseudonym (1822; the proportion of the result that was Bentham's and that which was Grote's is unclear).  Around 1823, Grote turned his Threadneedle St. home to a utilitarian reading room for the himself, the Mills and their friends. Alongside his banking job and utilitarian projects, George Grote was moving deep into classical history of ancient Greece, a endeavor his own inclination, prodded by James Mill's own hellenophilia.  In 1826, he published a large article in the Westminster Review, that demonstrated his researches were well on their way.  In 1826, Grote got deeply involved in the founding of University College London (UCL).  In this task, his role would be ambiguous.  Although his tireless work helped the university launch, his radical anti-clericalism would lead to trouble.  In 1830, Grote broke with his utilitarian friends - Brougham, James Mill and even Bentham - over the appointment of John Hoppus as professor of logic and philosophy of mind at UCL.  Grote's opposition was grounded on the fact that Hoppus was an ordained congregationalist minister, and thus unsuitable for the job at a non-denominational school. In 1830, as parliamentary reform approached, Grote entered into public debates again and, in 1832, was elected to parliament himself. He would serve until 1842. After leaving parliament,  Grote resigned from his bank and embarked on a European tour, during which he deepened his historical researchers.  They would eventually culminate into his magisterial multi-volume magnum opus, the History of Greece, that would begin to appear in 1846. In 1849, Grote seemingly buried the hatchet and was elected to the UCL council.  But he would soon cause trouble again.  In 1866, Hoppus's resignation had opened the chair in philosophy, and the bulk of the electors opted for James Martineau, the professor of philosophy at Manchester New College and, as chance would have it, an ordained unitarian minister. Again Grote's anti-clericalism hit high gear and he launched a highly-public opposition to Martineau's appointment.  Grote won the day, securing the chair for the inexperienced George Croom-Robertson (a friend of John Stuart Mill).  UCL's leading professor, Augustus de Morgan, resigned in protest.  Jacob Waley, the exiting professor of political economy, also lodged a public complaint. Despite all this, Grote succeeded Henry Brougham as president of the Council of UCL in 1868.  Grote's only significant contributions to utilitarian philosophy proper are contained in his posthumously-published Fragments (1876).

Hugo Grotius, 1583-1645,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/grotius.htm," Hugo Grotius (Huigh De Groot) was a Dutch legal scholar, philosopher playwright and poet.  Huigh de Groot (Grotius)  was to a well-to-do Calvinist family in Delft, in the Province of Holland, part of the United Provinces of the Netherlands.  His family were leading citizens inside Delft, and well-connected outside of it.  Showing an early aptitude for scholarship (sometimes characterized as a child prodigy), at the age of eleven, Grotius enrolled at the University of Leiden in 1594, studying classics and law, and received his degree in 1598.  Family connections secured him a position in a Dutch embassy led by Johann von Oldenbarnevelt, the grand pensionary of Holland, to France in 1598.  There, the young Grotious personally met the recently-installed Bourbon king Henry IV of France.  During his sojourn, Grotius received a (honorary) doctorate from the University of Orleans in 1599.  Upon returning to the Netherlands, Grotius set aside any academic aspirations and, following family expectations, set upon a legal career, registering as an advocate in the Hague.  It was a stepping stone to a future political career, under the patronage of Oldenbarnevelt.  In 1601, the Estates-General of the Netherlands commissioned Grotius to write an official history of the revolt of the Netherlands from Spanish rule. Grotius's interest in international law came as a result of the Dutch overseas expansion.  Throughout the 16th Century, overseas trade to Americas, Africa and Asia had been largely exclusive to the Spanish and Portuguese empires.  But the discovery and publication of the details of the Portuguese India trade by Dutch spies broke that old monopoly. In 1598, a slew of Dutch trading companies (voorcompagnie) were set up and launched fleet after fleet to Asia to break into Asian markets and pick at the decrepit Portuguese positions. The companies eventually congealed into the united East India Company (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie, VOC) in 1602 Things reached a head in early 1603, when the Dutch VOC captain Jacob van Heemskerk captured the Santa Catarina, a richly-laden Portuguese carrack anchored off Singapore, seizing a fortune in Sino-Japanese wares that nearly doubled the capital of the fledgling company.  This kicked off a discussion in Holland, as some shareholders had qualms about keeping the prize. Grotius entered the debate with his 1604 Commentary on the law of bounties and prizes, and more generally, on the law of the seas.  Although the general work would remain unpublished until 1868, the extract specifically related to the laws of the seas was published as an anonymous separate tract in 1609.  The Portuguese and Spanish authorities had replied to Dutch encroachment with the legal assertion that the oceans were their sovereign territory.  Contrary to the  ""closed seas"" (Mare clausum) doctrine of the Iberian powers, Grotius asserted a ""free seas"" (Mare liberum) doctrine, claiming no nation had the right of sovereignty over the oceans, that the high seas were open to navigation by everyone. Grotius's career star continued to rise.  He was appointed attorney-general of Holland in 1607, got married into an influential family 1608 and published a well-received poem on the passion of Christ that same year.  In 1610, Grotius composed a somewhat propagandist tract, claiming to find evidence of the existence of an ancient Batavian republic, serving as the legal basis for the right to existence of the current Dutch republic.   In 1612, he submitted his completed history of the Dutch Revolt to the States-General (albeit it was only published posthumously, in 1657).  Grotius's career peaked with his election to the leading civic position of pensionary of Rotterdam, and a seat on the provincial estates of Holland in 1613.  But Grotius would soon be embroiled in destructive political conflict.  The Dutch war with Spain had been suspended by a truce in 1609.  By his close association with Oldenbarnevelt, Grotius became involved in the sectarian politics inside the Netherlands, which broke out in the aftermath.  Although commonly portrayed as a religious conflict between strict Calvinists (Gormarists) and more flexible Remonstrants (Arminians), the quarrel was partly based on rapidly changing economic and social conditions which had been patched over during the war, but now broke into the open.  It pitted Oldenbarnevelt, the champion of the rising great burgher commercial elite of the domineering province of Holland, against the prince Maurice of Nassau, behind whom stood a complex alliance of the older aristocracy, the pietistic clergy,  the poorer urban classes, the other provinces and the central States-General. Oldenbarnevelt (and Grotius's) support of the Remonstrants was notionally an effort to prevent the erection of a Calvinist theocratic state, but de facto an attempt to prevent any schemes - whether an independent clergy, or a national Synod, or central directives from a States-General or the general army command - that might curtail or dilute the grip on political power the burgher elite of Holland enjoyed.  It was in the heat of this that Grotius published his pamphlet Ordinum Pietas (1613) commending the policy of toleration followed by the civic government of Holland, allowing Arminians to preach freely.  In conjunction with this, Grotius also wrote a more wide-ranging tract De imperio (unpublished) asserting the general right of civic authorities to ultimately determine religious policies.  Grotius pushed the envelope further in his Defensio (1617), a theological work, in which he concluded the Arminian doctrines were perfectly innocent of the charges of heresy.   It was ultimately not religion but rather the provincial Holland's position against a national army that finally led to Maurice's coup of  August 1618 and the subsequent suppression of the Remonstrants.  Grotius was arrested, along with Oldenbarnevelt and other Remonstrants, and tried for treason in a series of secret trials.  Oldenbarnevelt was executed ni May 1619, while Grotius were sentenced to life in prison and the confiscation of his property. While incarcerated at Loevestein fortress in 1620, Grotius wrote a didactic vernacular Dutch poem on religion (better known by its Latin title De veritate), addressed to laypeople, which was perhaps his most popular work in his lifetime.  During that same period, Grotius wrote his influential treatise on Dutch jurisprudence, much of it from memory  (pub. 1631), that would go on to be became a foundational basis of Dutch law until the 19th C. Grotius escaped prison in March, 1621, hidden in a chest of books, and made his way to France.  The high-profile escape embarrassed the Dutch authorities, and his Apologeticus issued from France, justifying his innocence and impugning his persecutors, dashed any hope of pardon.   If Grotius hoped for a warm reception and official positions in the court of Louis XIII, he was soon disappointed and frozen out by the suspicious Cardinal Richelieu. Grotius would spend the next decade in Paris, largely unemployed.  To pass his time, and perhaps win official favor, Grotius composed his most famous work, De Jure belli ac pacis (1625), a monumental treatise on international law. Hearing that the city of Delft had agreed to restore his property,  Grotius made his way back to Holland in 1631.  But he did not stay long. Grotius arrived with great fanfare and got immediately into some very public disputes, and by 1632, had to flee Holland again, this time making his way to Hamburg, Germany.  Entering the service of the Swedish crown, in 1635, Hugo Grotius returned to Paris as the ambassador of Sweden to the French court. Grotius died in Rostock in August, 1645, after having fallen ill on a troubled voyage between Sweden and Germany.  The publication of his remaining manuscripts was primarily arranged by his surviving wife and sons. As a natural law philosopher, Grotius is generally credited as the originator of ""natural morality"" and the ""social contract"" theory of the State, that was highly influential on later writers.   His 1609 book promoted idea that seas should be free for the innocent use and mutual benefit of all -- an idea disputed subsequently disputed by some Mercantilists.  Grotius's 1625 treatise is acknowledged as one the first treatises in international law.    Grotius famously argued that ""property"" was only the outcome of social consent, and thus had nothing ""inalienable"" in it, a conclusion subsequently disputed by Pufendorf.

Trygve Haavelmo, 1911-1999.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/haavelmo.htm," The Norwegian economist Trygve Haavelmo began his career as a student of Ragnar Frisch at University of Oslo.  He went to the United States  in 1939 as a Fulbright scholar, where he ended up staying until 1947.  Haavelmo spent much of his sojourn at the Cowles Commission, before returning to Oslo.  He remained a professor a the University of Oslo until his retirement. It was during his stay in the United States that Haavelmo wrote his most influential work -- a 1944 article introducing the ""probability approach"" to econometrics. The ""probability"" approach argued that we should envision existing economic data series as being ""a sample selected by Nature"", i.e. randomly derived from a ""hypothetical"" series of distribution which governed reality but which was unobservable. Thus, Haavelmo argued, we can test the validity of economic theories by couching the theoretical model in terms of statistical relationships which can then be tested. The relationship between theory and the hypothetical underlying ""reality"", argued Haavelmo, is akin to the relationship between the observed data and that ""reality"". Therefore, if we can come close in relating theory with observed data in some precisely defined statistical manner, then we are effectively saying we have ""reproduced"" another ""natural drawing"" from the hypothetical ""reality"" and thus our theoretical relationships are in a sense ""true"". Haavelmo also addressed the issues of identification problems in simultaneous equations econometric problems (Haavelmo, 1943, 1947).  It was Haavelmo who differentiated the ""structural"" from the ""reduced"" form equation and discussed the relationship between the original parameters and the reduced-form estimates.  It was Haavelmo that introduced the ""determinant condition"" for identifiability.   This set the ground for the ""Cowles approach"" approach to econometrics and the methodological debates on empirical economics that raged during the 1940s. Haavelmo contributed to other areas of economics. In business cycle theory, Haavelmo argued in an 1940 paper that one need not obtain oscillations as a solution to a dynamic model as one can obtain business cycles with a monotonic dynamical system, provided there is an appropriate pattern of shocks a la Slutsky.  Haavelmo is also responsible for the famous Keynesian ""balanced budget multiplier theorem"" (1945). In the 1950s, Haavelmo moved in more theoretical directions.  In 1954, he published a book on growth theory with ""skill accumulation"" that anticipates many of the themes of modern ""endogenous growth"" theories.  His most bold effort was in attempting to set out a micro-founded theory of investment (1960).  Haavelmo identified the main problems of reconciling a theory of capital with a theory of  investment.   Trygve Haavelmo won the Nobel memorial prize in 1989.

Gottfried von Haberler, 1900-1995,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/haberler.htm," Austrian economic theorist. Although taught by Wieser and von Mises and later a professor at Vienna, Gottfried Haberler was a product of the Austrian School but not exactly a doctrinaire follower of Austrian theory. In 1936, Haberler moved to Harvard where, together with Schumpeter and Leontief, he would teach the ""golden generation"" of  Harvard economists. Haberler's two major works - Theory of International Trade (1936) and Prosperity and Depression (1937) - were hailed as masterly tomes which, for the first time in either field, drew together numerous scattered ideas into a single theoretical treatment which was both encyclopaedic and rigorous.  Haberler's 1936 work on international trade theory was complemented by several articles which sought to place the theory of comparative advantage on both a positive and normative basis.  Haberler's rewriting of the theory of comparative advantage in terms of opportunity cost, rather than real cost, led to a long debate with Jacob Viner. Haberler's 1937 review of business cycle theory contains a sizzling critique of Keynes's General Theory, followed up by his equally unsympathetic 1946 and 1962 reviews of the same. He was an unreconstructed proponent of  over-investment theories of the cycle, like that of Hayek. Haberler was also addicted to policy. From the beginning, he was a constant advocate of both free trade and flexible exchange rates as well as arguing the Monetarist line on internal government policy. In 1971, Haberler left Harvard to become a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute together with his old schoolmate Fritz Machlup. His neo-liberal policy prescriptions became the hallmark of that institution.      Major works of Gottfried Haberler HET   Resources on Gottfried von Haberler All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Arthur T. Hadley, 1856-1930,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hadley.htm,"  American ""new generation""  historicist/apologist at Yale. Born into an academic family, Arthur Twining Hadley finished his undergraduate work under William Graham Sumner at Yale in 1872 before departing for Germany to undertake graduate work under Adolph Wagner at Berlin.   However impressed he was by the German Historicist method, Hadley was not impressed by the state socialist leanings of his German professors.  From the beginning to the end, Hadley was a proponent of dogmatic laissez-faire.   Arthur T. Hadley returned to the United States in 1879.  Upon his arrival, he was appointed as a lecturer in Greek at Yale in 1878.  He began teaching economics topics (notably railway administration) in 1883.  However, failing to get a more permanent salaried appointment, Hadley resigned from Yale and tried to work as a free-lance writer and tutor.   In 1885, Hadley finished his painstaking study of railroads, a masterpiece much influenced by his German background.  It made him an instant authority on the subject, and Hadley was employed on economic commissions by the state government of Connecticut. Impressed by his book, the Yale professor H.W. Farnam lent his political and financial support to have Hadley appointed a professor of political science at Yale in 1886.   In 1891, upon  Sumner's departure for a two-year leave, Arthur Hadley was quickly made professor of political economy at Yale and placed in charge of social sciences.  In 1892, Hadley was appointed as the first dean of Yale's Graduate School of Arts in Sciences.  In 1899, Arthur T. Hadley became the President of Yale, a post which he would hold until his retirement in 1921.  Arthur T. Hadley evolved into the quintessential American apologist, . Hadley's highly influential textbook (1896) used economics as pure apologetics for gilded age American capitalist institutions.   Like his master Sumner, Hadley absorbed the ""Social Darwinism"" of Spencer, and defended the monopolistic trusts as the ""outcome"" of the struggle of the fittest.  By economies of scale, Hadley argued, large firms are more capable of absorbing losses during price declines in the course of a cycle.  In this manner, ""natural selection"" would gradually weed out inefficient small firms.  The laws of economics had thus deemed that there was an ""inherent"" tendency towards concentration and monopoly.  As a result, Hadley regarded all kinds of government regulations to enforce competition as ultimately fruitless.  The best thing that can be hoped for, Hadley contended, is that the managers of these monopolistic corporations will realize they are in a position of public trust and refrain from abusing their market power.  But how?  The very threat of socialist revolt, Hadley argued, would ""weed out"" the more rapacious and socially unfit captains of industry.  The ""best"" and most ""responsible"" men  will ultimately rise to the top.    Perhaps it is no surprise that Hadley was precisely the kind of economist that Veblen and the Institutionalists loved to hate!      Major Works of Arthur T. Hadley   Resources on A.T.

Frank H. Hahn, 1925-2013,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hahn.htm," Cambridge general equilibrium theorist. The perennial renegade, Frank H. Hahn spent most of his professional life at Cambridge as virtually the sole Neo-Walrasian member of an ardently Keynesian department. Perhaps his socialization with the irascible critics of Neoclassical economics, such as Joan Robinson, imbibed in him a considerable degree of sobriety and skepticism towards the very Neoclassical economics in which he was a master. Frank H. Hahn was born in Berlin, Germany.  The family moved to Prague in 1931, then to England in 1938, where Hahn completed his studies at Bournemouth school.  Hahn served as an RAF navigator during WWII, and, after the war, enrolled at the LSE to complete his studies. At LSE, Hahn came under the influence of John Hicks and Nicholas  Kaldor.  Hahn's Ph.D. thesis on income distribution, supervised by Kaldor, was very ""Kaldorian""/Cambridge School, and yielded a couple of papers. (it was only published in full in 1972. Hahn joined the faculty at the University of Birmingham in 1948, then a rising economics department.  Hahn credits his mathematically-oriented colleague at Birmingham, W.T. Gorman, as his greatest influence. Hahn soon shed his Kaldorian garb and emerged as a rising Neo-Walrasian general equilibrium theorist. He remained at Birmingham for ten years.  After a visiting year at MIT in 1959-60, Frank H. Hahn moved to Cambridge University, where he was elected fellow at the newly-created graduate-oriented Churchill College. At the time, the university was dominated by the Keynesian giants of the Cambridge School, like Joan Robinson, Richard F. Kahn and his old mentor Nicholas Kaldor.  Although Hahn's embrace of the Neo-Walrasian research program was ideologically at odds with the Cambridge approach, their interaction was intellectually stimulating and challenging for both. Frank Hahn moved back to the LSE in 1967, as professor of economics, and was joined there by Gorman.  They reorganized the LSE department on more modern lines, and brought in Michio Morishima and Amartya Sen.  In 1972, Hahn moved back to Cambridge, but the old giants had now gone into retirement, and the atmosphere become more fractious and political.  In 1976, Hahn brought in a substantial fifteen-year grant from ESRC, and used it to bring in a  steady stream of researchers interested in combining general equilibrium theory, uncertainty theory and monetary theory.  The ""missing markets"" research program virtually grew out of Hahn's Cambridge seminar.   Frank H. Hahn viewed the Neo-Walrasian research programme without illusions - remaining one of its most ardent and articulate defenders but, unique among Neoclassical economists, also acknowledging and stressing its limits clearly. (e.g. 1970, 1973, 1974, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1985)  Nonetheless Hahn remained an critic of all systems -  Monetarist, New Classical, Neo-Ricardian, Post Keynesian, all. But he was not a dogmatic nihilist: if his methodological position could be summed up in a phrase, it would might be ""let a hundred flowers bloom - but take none too seriously."" His positive contributions are many: his work can be more-or-less divided into concerns over general equilibrium (1971), the tatonnement and non-tatonnement stability of multi-market equilibrium (1958, 1962, 1970, 1982), the theory of money in sequence economies (1965, 1971, 1973),  the theory of economic growth with heterogeneous stores of value (1966, 1968, 1969, 1973), conjectural equilibria (1977) and combining all these with each other. Frank H. Hahn retired from Cambridge in 1992, and took up an appointment at the University of Siena, Italy.  He continued there until 2000, then retired in Cambridge.   Hahn passed away on 29 January, 2013.      Major Works of Frank H. Hahn   HET   Resources on Frank Hahn   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Sir Matthew Hale, 1609-1676.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hale.htm," Matthew Hale was born in Alderley, Gloucestershire, descended from an eminent family of cloth merchants and lawyers.  Orphaned early, Matthew Hale was raised by an uncle, of Puritan leanings.  In 1626, at the age of seventeen, Matthew Hale enrolled at Magdalen Hall, Oxford University, where he was quickly entranced by its cavalier atmosphere of drinking, dueling and theater.  Forsaking his uncle's desires to become a divine, Hale determined to enter a more adventurous life in the military, and was briefly attached to Maurice of Orange's army in the Netherlands. A lawsuit over his inheritance of his late father's estate prompted Hale to return to England, and research the law to defend his case.  It was then that he determined to give up his dissolute pursuits and study law seriously, enrolling at Lincoln's Inn in late 1629.  Called to the bar in 1637, Hale ascended in the legal profession.  Although a royalist by inclination, Hale tried to remain neutral in the political tumult and English Civil War of the 1640s.  Hale signed the Solemn Covenant of 1644 and was one of the chief negotiators for the surrender of Oxford in 1645, but subsequently sought to bring about reconciliation between King and Parliament (to no avail) and defended royalists in several court cases.  Despite his independence, Oliver Cromwell appointed Hale a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in 1653.  During the English Protectorate period, Hale sat as a member of the parliaments of 1654 and 1658, and tried to steer a moderate course.  After the death of Cromwell in 1658, Hale resigned from public life, returning only in the Convention Parliament of 1660 to approve the Restoration of monarchy.  Hale was knighted and appointed Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1660 by King Charles II. In 1671, Sir Matthew Hale became Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Hale resigned in February 1676 on account of health, dying at the end of the same year (Dec 25). Most of Hale's works were published posthumously.  Among the notable economic-related tracts were his essay on population (1677) and on the Poor Laws (1683), where he recommended the establishment of workhouses.  Hale's histories of the Pleas of the Crown (1682) and Common Law (1713), while idiosyncratic, are generally well-regarded by law historians.

John Hales, ?-1572,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hales.htm,"English public official and parliamentarian, one of the leading ""Commonwealth"" writers of Tudor England. John Hales came from a cadet branch of a notable Kentish family. He was a relative of Christopher Hales, attorney-general of England during the Reformation parliament of Henry VIII and close associate of the powerful Thomas Cromwell,   John Hales availed himself of these family connections to buy up substantial amounts of monastic land in 1540 during the dissolution of the monasteries.  Hales used some of this land to found a grammar school in Coventry in 1545.    Hales was an ardent Protestant reformer During the reign of the young Edward VI of England, John Hales was a member of parliament for Preston and apparently also a royal official (""clerk of the hanaper"").  John Hales became a close advisor to the young king's handler, Edward Seymour (Duke of Somerset), who had assumed power as Lord Protector in 1547. With a poor harvest that year, England was gripped by a bout of inflation and agrarian discontent in 1548.  Sir Thomas Smith blamed the inflation on debasements, but John Hales blamed it on illegal land-enclosures and the ill-practices of  profiteering and colluding merchants.  In July 1548, Somerset appointed Hales to lead a commission to enforce legislation against enclosures.  Hales's commission worked through late 1548 and early 1549, chiefly in the Midlands, undoing many enclosures.  He also promoted bills in parliament against certain trading practices.  But apparently that was not enough.  Anger against enclosures erupted violently in the Kett uprising in Norfolk in 1549.  The Kett uprisings were crushed, but Hales was blamed by many landlords for encouraging agrarian resistance and fomenting a peasant war.  The Earl of Warwick, with the backing of the landed gentry, drove Somerset from power later that year (October 1549).  With his protector gone, Hales was arrested. After a brief period of imprisonment in the Tower of London, John Hales went into exile, making his way to Germany in 1551. John Hales is the likely author of the well-known anonymous tract, the Discourse of the Common Weal.  It was originally written shortly after 1549, apparently to justify the activities of the enclosures commission, and was probably completed while Hales was in exile in Germany in the 1550s.  The earliest extant manuscript copy dates from 1565. It was first published in 1581, under the anonymous initials ""W.S."". (see below) The Discourse has been regarded by some commentators as being the ""first"" economics tract in the English language.  It sets itself out to identify the causes of a whole host of economic ills, such as inflation and unemployment.  The great novelty of the the Discourse is that it regards the economy as an object of ""scientific"" analysis, and not merely as a sounding board for political, legal or moral idealism.  Not that the Discourse refrains from moralizing -- e.g. land enclosures, monopolistic behavior, free trade and debasement are zealously condemned.  However, they are denounced not because they deviate from some metaphysical ideals, but rather because of their concrete, harmful effects on social welfare, the ""common weal"".   Anticipating later Mercantilist doctrines, the Discourse blames England's actual economic difficulties on lack of money, which, in turn, is traced to unfavorable trade balances.  The Discourse articulates a very cogent ""infant industry"" argument for the protectionism.  No less remarkably, the Discourse deftly and presciently handles the notion of ""incentives"" to economic behavior.  For instance, it identifies artificially-low prices in the wheat market (relative to wool) as the principal cause of the wasteful (and thus ""evil"") phenomenon of enclosing arable land for pasture. Interestingly, the anonymous editor (""W.S."") of the 1581 edition of the treatise replaces the traditional ""debasement""  theory of inflation articulated by Hales in the original manuscript with the novel Quantity Theory of Money, that had been propounded by Jean Bodin in the intervening years.  The Discourse first appeared in print in 1581 under the title Briefe Conceipt touching the common weale of this realme of England (commonly referred to as Brief Conceipt of English Pollicy, as per the headnotes), to which was affixed an elaborate title page with a longer title (A Compendius or briefe examination, etc.) and the author identified merely by the initials ""W.S."".  The identity of ""W.S."" remains uncertain.  For a long time, some commentators (rather improbably) speculated it to be a teenage William Shakespeare, others ascribed it to William Stafford, a famous Elizabethan courtier and conspirator. But detective work by historians of economic thought (notably, Elizabeth Lamond, 1892) has revised this view. Lamond suggested the 1581 treatise was merely the publication of an original manuscript written around 1549 by John Hales, that had since been lost.  Two handwritten manuscripts, written around 1565 (during Hales's lifetime), have been uncovered (and republished 1893 under the title Discourse of the Common Weal).  The published treatise of 1581 has only minor differences from the 1565 editions - the most notable of which is the articulation of the Quantity Theory in place of the debasement theory.  It is likely that the ""W.S."" refers to Sir William Smith, nephew of Sir Thomas Smith, the prominent Elizabethan secretary of state and likely recipient of a copy of Hales' original tract, who made some modifications, and published it under his own initials in 1581.  The exact details of Hales's subsequent life are obscure and a little confusing. By one account, Hales seems to have returned to England briefly, but went into exile again in August 1553, after the ascension of the Catholic Queen Mary I. John Hales remained in Germany, chiefly Frankfurt, for the duration of Mary's reign.  He returned to England only after the ascension of the protestant Queen Elizabeth I in 1558.  He died in 1572.  (There is a possibility that there are two different ""John Hales"" whose biographies have been intermixed, both of whom went into exile in Germany at different times.  This conjecture proposes that the first John Hales, of Coventry, of the enclosure commission, our writer, left for Germany in 1551; the second John Hales, the clerk of the hanaper, was a different person, possibly his nephew, the son of elder brother Christopher.  It was this second John Hales who was divested of his hanaper office in 1553 at the ascension of Mary I, as a routine part of the administrative house-cleaning of the new regime, particularly since his relatives, including both his father and uncle, were among the party of Protestant exiles.  The second John left in 1553 made his way to Germany to join them.)        Major Works of John Hales     Resources on John Hales   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Charles Hall, 1745-1825.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/charleshall.htm,"British physician and among the earliest ""Ricardian Socialists"".  Little is known of Charles Hall, save that he was a physician and studied at Leiden, the Netherlands, before returning to Britain, and setting up in Travistock (Devon).  His medical career was not, apparently, a success and an expensive lawsuit left him impoverished.  Hall would eventually be jailed for debt in 1816, where he would remain for nearly a decade, and died shortly after being released from Fleet Street prison in 1825. Charles Hall wrote only one hard-to-find 1805 treatise, the Effects of Civilization.  He picks up Malthus's theory of population, but takes its implications in a different direction. Hall concludes that a stationary population implies a very high death rate, which he promptly identifies as infant mortality among the poor, due to the very conditions of poverty, and extrapolates this to observations on inequality in society generally. Although his thesis was reminiscent and compared by contemporaries to Rousseau, Hall was not fantasizing about impossible returns to states of nature, but addressing inequality as it was concretely.  Charles Hall took the Smith'slabor theory of value to its logical extreme - i.e. the concept of labor exploitation. However, while some of Hall's claims were often quoted by contemporary socialists, the estimates were often outlandish and invented for effect (notably, Hall's famous claim that only 1/8th of total product was kept by labor).

Alexander Hamilton, 1757-1804,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hamilton.htm,"American lawyer, military officer, federalist statesman, first US Secretary of the Treasury and grandfather of the  ""the American System"".

Alexander Hamilton was born in in 1757 (some say 1755) in Charlestown , on the island of Nevis in the British West Indies. Hamilton's father was a Scottish merchant from St. Kitts, his mother descended from Huguenot planters in St. Croix. The parents separated, and Alexander and his brother were initially raised by their mother on St. Croix. After her death in 1769, the Hamilton brothers were effectively orphans. Alexander apprenticed as a clerk in a general store at the age of 12. In 1772, with financial assistance from his aunts, Alexander immigrated to New York in 1772, and enrolled at King's College (future Columbia) in 1773.

With the outbreak of the American revolutionary war in 1775, Hamilton interrupted his studies and raised a volunteer militia company in New York, rising to the position of captain of the artillery. Participating in the New York military campaigns, Hamilton's abilities were noticed by his superiors. On March 1, 1777, general George Washington appointed the twenty-year-old Alexander Hamilton as an aide-de-camp in his general staff. Washington and Hamilton maintained a close relationship for the next few years, although they had a falling out in February 1781. Hamilton continued in military service until the end of 1783, when he retired with the rank of colonel.

Hamilton took up a new career as a lawyer in New York, being admitted to the bar in 1782.  In June 1782, he was appointed receiver of taxes and later that year entered as delegate to Congress November 1782, but resumed his law practice in 1783. Hamilton had first articulated his ideas for a national bank in a 1779-80 letter to Robert Morris, the superintendent of finances of the US confederation (lett).  In 1781,  Hamilton wrote up the draft proposal that led superintendent Robert Morris to found the Bank of North America in Philadelphia in 1781 (lett). Hamilton founded his own commercial bank, the Bank of New York in June 1784, with a capitalization of $500,000 (Hamilton's Bank of New York would continue operating as an independent bank for over two centuries, until its merger with Mellon in 2007). A long-standing ""nationalist"", Alexander Hamilton deplored the fragmentary structure of the United States under the 1777 Articles of Confederation (e.g. 1780 letter to Duane).  Through the early 1780s, Hamilton conducted extensive correspondence with other nationalists, like George Washington, John Jay and James Madison, deploring the parochial jealousy of individual states and the ineffectiveness of the Continental Congress.   Hamilton was part of the New York delegation to the Annapolis Convention in Maryland in September 1786, originally designed to coordinate interstate commerce. Hamilton drafted the Annapolis proposal recommending a constitutional convention, to amend the articles of confederation. Naturally, Hamilton was a New York delegate to the convention that met in Philadelphia on May 14, 1787. In the course of the convention,  Hamilton made a controversial six-hour speech outlining his plan for a constitution. Hamilton outlined an extremely centralized quasi-monarchical government, with a president and senate elected for life, and where individual states were little more than that administrative geographic units of a unitary state, with centrally-appointed governors  [June 18 plan,  speech].  Historians still debate whether Hamilton's extreme scheme was a deliberate strategic ploy to make James Madison's ""Virginia plan"" appear moderate by comparison, and make it more acceptable to the delegates.   Hamilton and Madison led the ""committee of style"" that wrote up the language of the final draft of the US Constitution, which was finally signed in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787. 

In response to a series of anti-constitution screeds, Alexander Hamilton began writing a series of articles defending the proposed constitution under the pseudonym ""Publius"", which began appearing in the New York press in October 1787, and continued through the first half of 1788 . Hamilton got John Jay and subsequently James Madison to contribute articles to the series. The first bound volume of articles, titled The Federalist, was published in March 1788, and a second volume in May. The last articles in the series were concluded by Hamilton in August 1788.  Hamilton shepherded the ratification of the constitution through the New York convention in 1788.

The Constitution adopted, the first United States Congress assembled in New York in April 1789. The former revolutionary war general George Washington was unanimously elected by the electoral college as the first president of the United States, and Massachusetts lawyer John Adams as vice-president.  The very second act was the passage of the ""Madison tariff"" in June 1789, a temporary and primarily revenue-oriented ad valorem duty of 5%, with higher rates for some luxury goods. A Department of the Treasury was subsequently established on September 2, and Alexander Hamilton appointed first Secretary of the Treasury on September 11, 1789. This was followed up later that month by the establishment of the Supreme Court, and the appointment of Hamilton's federalist confrere John Jay as chief justice.

The Washington cabinet was dominated by the rivalry between Hamilton and Virginian lawyer Thomas Jefferson, who had been appointed Secretary of State (foreign minister). Fellow Virginian James Madison, despite his earlier collaboration with Hamilton, gravitated to Jefferson, and become the leading Jeffersonian ally on the floor of the House of Representatives.

In January 1790, Hamilton submitted his first Report on Public Credit to Congress, recommending means to address the war debt. Hamilton estimated the total public debt to stand around $77m - of which $11m was owed to foreign creditors, $40m to domestic public, and some $25m in state debts.  Long unserviced, US debt certificates circulated far below par.  Nonetheless, arguing the importance of restoring credit of the new US government, Hamilton asked Congress to redeem them at face value, with interest arrears, and pledge the bulk of future customs and tonnage duties to paying it down. He also asked that state debts be assumed by the federal government.  Hamilton's report was opposed on most grounds by House leader James Madison, soon joined by Sec of State Thomas Jefferson.  Madison noted that much of the debt certificates had been accumulated by a small number of commercial houses and bankers (mostly from New York and Philadelphia) at a hefty discount from the original holders (many of them poor veterans from rural states), so redeeming them at face value would be merely rewarding big fortunes for speculation.  Madison proposed instead to pay the current holders only the purchase price for their certificates, and pay the remainder to the original veteran holders.  Madison also opposed federal assumption of state debt as some states (notably, Madison's own Virginia) had already paid off most of theirs.  Nonetheless, Hamilton pressed for full redemption declaring the concentration of debt-holders a minor issue, that the big fortunes would likely be invested in commercial and manufacturing enterprises beneficial to US growth. Finally, Hamilton noted that the crux of the matter was not who got  paid, but the restoration of US credit, and that stabilized debt certificates would serve the role of as paper money, and energize the US economy. Hamilton's public debt plan was defeated by the Madison-led house in April, 1790. But a compromise was famously reached over a private dinner on June 20, between Hamilton, Jefferson and Madison, where the Virginians dropped their opposition to Hamilton's debt scheme, while Hamilton agreed to a special exemption for Virginia, and to support a proposed move of the federal capital from New York to a ""District of Columbia"" on the Potomac River. The relocation act was passed into law in 1790, and Hamilton's scheme for redemption and assumption was passed in August 1790.  That same month, Congress authorized the formation of a ""sinking fund"" to manage the repayment of the public debt. The sinking fund's board of trustees consisted of Hamilton, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and John Jay (soon replaced by Edmund Randolph). Still that same month (Aug 1790), on Hamilton's recommendations in a series of reports, Congress passed a new tariff act (the ""Hamilton Tariff""), setting the revenue tariff on a permanent basis, with a mix of specific and ad valorem duties, slightly higher than the 1789 Madison tariff, but still principally gained towards revenue, and only very mildly protective of manufactures.  The Hamilton tariff would remain the baseline of US tariff law until 1816.  In December 1790, Hamilton delivered his famous First and Second Report on Public Finance The first report recommended the establishment of a internal tax on distilled spirits (""Whiskey Tax""),  justified partly as a measure to pay down the massive war debt, partly as 'social discipline'.  In the Second Report, Hamilton recommended  the establishment of a National Bank, to serve as a depositary institution for the Treasury, a provider of short-term government finance and supply a unified national currency.  Hamilton proposed funding the bank with $10 million in stock, to be 20% owned by the federal government (via a loan advanced by the bank itself), the remaining 80% sold to private shareholders. The bank, however, would have no supervisory powers. Outside of its depository role for the government, the bank would otherwise be a normal private commercial bank, making loans to the general public, etc. (at the time there were only three commercial banks in the US - the Bank of North America in Philadelphia (est. 1781), Bank of Massachusetts (est. 1784) and Hamilton's own Bank of New York (est. 1784). Among other conditions proposed Hamilton, the national bank would be the only federally-chartered bank for the next twenty years, until 1811 (although it did not preclude states from chartering other banks in the interim), that foreigners could only own non-voting shares, and, to avoid exploitation, the bank would be prevented from buying government bonds nor issue notes beyond its capital value.  The two reports were following quickly by a third report on January 1791, calling for the establishment of a national mint. Despite fierce opposition from Jefferson and Madison, Hamilton's proposals passed Congress virtually intact in a short period. The act chartering the First Bank of the United States in Philadelphia was passed February 25, 1791. The Whiskey Tax took more wrangling, but was also passed on March 3, 1791.. The mint was authorized by Congressional resolution on the same day, but the actual legislation establishing the US Mint had to wait a year, and was passed only during the next session of Congress (April 2, 1792) In December 1791, Hamilton produced the Report on Manufactures, another of his series of famous reports. Here, Hamilton recommended more openly setting the United States on Mercantilist footing not only through high protective tariffs (higher than the Hamilton tariff of 1790) but also direct subsidies ('bounties') to select industries, paid for with revenues raised from the tariffs. This was the first articulation of what some would later call the ""the American System"" (as opposed to the liberal ""British System"" of free trade).  However celebrated, the Hamilton report had next-to-no impact on legislation.  Jefferson disdained Hamilton's protectionist tendencies, recommending instead to pursue reciprocal trade agreements signed with foreign countries (except Britain). Hamilton tried to push for restructuring the tariff in this vision, but only a slight general rise was agreed to in May 1792, its structure otherwise unchanged. Protective tariffs would not be introduced until 1816.

Attempts to collect Hamilton's 1791 whiskey tax led to a rebellion in the Appalachians in 1794, starting out in western Pennsylvania, and stretching all the way down to Georgia. The rebellion was crushed by November, but the Whiskey Tax went largely unenforced thereafter, and was finally abolished in 1803.

Later that same year (November 1794), John Jay was sent to London to negotiate a treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom.  Following Hamilton's instructions, the Jay Treaty settled outstanding matters from the revolutionary war, including the removal of British garrisons from the northwest territories and the referral of other disputes- notably the  restitution of loyalist property and the US-Canadian border - to arbitration. Critical economic clauses of the treaty include opening American access to British colonial trade, in return for a voluntary US export restraint on cotton.  The reaction to the Jay Treaty inside the United States was vociferous.  The attack on the treaty was led by the rabidly anti-British Thomas Jefferson. Despite sometimes violent expressions of popular disapproval, the Jay Treaty was nonetheless ratified by Congress in July 1795. It is around this time that the party terms ""Federalist"" (for Hamilton's supporters) and ""Democratic Republicans"" (for Jefferson's party) began to be used with frequency.

On January 31, 1795, Hamilton resigned as Secretary of the Treasury, returning to his law practice. This was mostly for pecuniary reasons (salary as a civil servant was inadequate), but also partly from exhaustion from the House inquiries into the State of the Treasury.  Before leaving, Hamilton submitted another Report on Public Credit, asking Congress to make earlier taxes permanent, secure their enforcement and calling for new taxes to pay down the public debt.  After his resignation, Hamilton continued involved in politics, trying to play the role of eminence grise, advising his successor in the Treasury Oliver Walcott, Jr, as well as the new Secretary of State Timothy Pickering and Sec of War James McHenry.. Hamilton continued to enjoy a very close personal relationship with Washington, and had grown used to being a dominant advisor, and even drafted Washington's farewell address in 1796.  The ascension of John Adams as president in 1797 dimished Hamilton's political influence. Although both were federalists, Adams had a considerable personal dislike of Hamilton, which only increased with Hamilton's continued political intrigues.  Hamilton had marred Adams's election with a hare-brained scheme to elbow Adams off the top of the ticket.  Hamilton's scheme misfired, and Adams ended up having to cohabit with rival Thomas Jefferson as vice-president.  But Hamilton was unrepentant.  Adams inherited Washington's cabinet wholesale, and Hamiltonian allies Walcott, Pickering, McHenry, etc. were a focal point of opposition to Adams.

The Jay treaty and Washington's neutrality proclamation (both advised by Hamilton) naturally infuriated the French Republic, which had been under the impression until then that the 1778 American-French alliance was still in effect. The French subsequently began to treat the US as an undeclared British ally. After a series of seizures of American ships and notice of French privateers prowling the east American coast in 1797, Hamilton led a call for war against France.  Hamilton returned to military life, assuming the office of major-general in the US army during the undeclared ""quasi-war"" of 1798-1800. But tensions were eventually defused by Adams's diplomatic efforts.. Hamilton's intrigues against president Adams intensified - he published a public Letter in 1800 accusing Adams of misconduct, splitting the federalists. When the election of 1800 came down to a vote in the House, Hamilton held his nose and gave his voting bloc to Jefferson, placing personal spite ahead of party ideology. As a result, Jefferson became president in 1801. Blamed for the denouement, Hamilton's reputation suffered greatly and his influence evaporated

Hamilton's most fateful rivalry was with fellow New Yorker, Aaron Burr, Jefferson's vice-president. Formerly friends, Hamilton and Burr had fallen out over a variety of issues - Burr's setup of a rival Bank of Manhattan, Burr's switch to George Clinton and the Democratic Republicans in New York state politics, etc.  During the 1804 race for governor of New York, Hamilton wrote a screed denouncing Burr's character, which  led Burr to challenge him to a duel with pistols. Burr and Hamilton met at the appointed hour on July 11, 1804, in Weehawken, New Jersey. Hamilton missed, but Burr did not..Fatally wounded, Alexander Hamilton died the next day. (Burr was formally charged with murder, but subsequently acquitted).  Hamilton is buried in the grounds of Trinity Church, in lower Manhattan.

Dag Hammarskjold, 1905-1961.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hammarskjold.htm," Swedish Stockholm School economist and civil servant.  Later better known as Secretary-General of the United Nations organization from 1953 until his death in 1961  Dag Hammarskjöld came from a distinguished Swedish family, his father Hjalmar Hammarskjöld having served as prime minister of Sweden in 1914-17.  Dag Hammarsjkold studied at Uppsala for his undergraduate degree, and then received his doctorate at the University of Stockholm, with a dissertation on economic fluctuations written under Gunnar Myrdal.   Hammarskjold's 1933 article is a classic piece of the Stockholm School, where develops a mathematical model formalizing the incongruity between ex ante plans and ex post results. Hammarskhold taught at the university of Stockholm from 1933 until 1936, when he abandoned academia and transitioned into public service.  Hammarskjold served initially in the Swedish ministry of Finance from 1936 to 1945, and, from 1941 to 1948, as chairman of the board of the Riksbank, the Swedish central bank. Dag Hammarskjold went on to serve on the Swedish delegation to the United Nations. He was elected 1953 as Secretary-General of the UN, succeeded the first holder Tryvie Lie.  Dammarskjold died in a plane crash in 1961 near Ndola, Zambia, while shuttling on a peace mission to end the Congo civil war.  He received the Nobel Peace Prize posthumously in 1961.

Alvin H. Hansen, 1887-1975.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hansen.htm," American economist at Harvard, that began as an American Institutionalist but converted into one of the leading proponents of Keynesianism in the United States. Alvin Harvey Hansen was born in Viborg, South Dakota, the son of Danish immigrants. Hansen got his undergraduate studies from Yankton and went on to pursue his graduate studies at the  Institutionalist citadel of University of Wisconsin, studying under Ely and Commons.  He received in Ph.D in 1918, with a thesis on business cycles.  After a stint as an instructor at Brown,  Hansen joined the faculty of the University of Minnesota in 1919. Alvin Hansen became a professor at  Harvard in 1937.  Hansen famous ""secular stagnation"" thesis came out the next year, in his presidential address to the AEA, with the harrowing vision of an economy trapped permanently in a slump of low population growth and low investment..  At first suspicious of Keynes's General Theory when it first came out, Hansen soon converted c.1938 and became its chief champion.  His 1941 treatise re-articulated American business cycle history in terms of Keynesian theory.   Although never quite in a formal position as a top  government advisor, Hansen had an enormous indirect impact on US government macroeconomic policy.  Hansen served on several government advisory posts, e.g. research director at the Committee on Policy in International Relations (1933-34), advisor to the Committee on Social Security (1940-41), and advisor to the Federal Reserve Board (1940-45), but his bigger impact was through his books, articles and reports.  An advocate of active fiscal policy, Hansen was a moving figure behind the  Employment Act of 1946, making full employment (restated as ""maximum employment"" by nervous congressmen) an explicit goal of the US federal government policy, and helped explain its logic and purpose to the public. Arguably, Hansen's longer impact was a teacher of the ""golden generation"" of Harvard students and his slim 1953 Guide to Keynes, which helped spread the Neo-Keynesian synthesis in an understandable form.  Hansen retired from Harvard in 1962.      Major works of Alvin H. Hansen   Resources on Alvin Hansen   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Bent Hansen's studies at the University of Copenhagen were interrupted by the Nazi invasion of Denmark in 1940, and he fled across the sound to Sweden.  He obtained his Ph.D. at the University of Uppsala,. under Erik Lindahl, with his ground-breaking thesis on inflation. He continued as a professor at Uppsala, and in 1955 was appointed director of the Swedish national business cycle center, the Konjukturinstitutet in Stockholm.  A romantic episode induced him to move to Cairo in 1961, working for a while as an Egyptian government advisor, and then as a consultant for the OECD, Hansen moved to the United States, and became a professor of economics UC Berkeley.  He remained there until his retirement in 1987. Bent Hansen brought aspects of the Stockholm School into the modern era.

Harberger earned his B.A. at Johns Hopkins, then went on to received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1950, under Lloyd Metzler, with a thesis on currency devaluation.  After a stint as an instructor at Johns Hopkins,  Harberger returned and joined the Chicago faculty in 1953.  Harberger moved firmly in an applied direction, towards public finance.  His famous 1954 paper introduced the ""Harberger Triangles"", a measure of the deadweight loss from monopoly, or any degree of industrial concentration.  Harberger is also famous for his work on corporate taxation, notably his 1962 thesis that the incidence of corporate taxation also falls on the non-corporate sector. Harberger went on to make several notable contributions on cost-benefit analysis, public finance and trade policy, with particular attention on developing countries.  Harberger is frequently referred as the mentor to the ""Chicago Boys"", the generation of Latin American economists trained under him at Chicago, responsible for introducing free market reforms in many Latin American countries since the 1980s.

Harcourt was trained by Robinson and Kaldor at Cambridge, where he received his doctorate in 1960.  He returned to Australia to teach at the University of Adelaide, but remained a frequent figure at Cambridge, e.g. Harcourt was a lecturer at Trinity Hall in 1964-66, fellow of Clare Hall in 1972-73 and from 1982, fellow and eventually president (1990) of Jesus College, Cambridge. Geoffrey Harcourt is perhaps best known for his elucidatory review of the Cambridge Capital Controversy (1969, 1972).  Harcourt's own contributions encompass the Neo-Ricardian and Post Keynesian schools - as exemplified by his Cantabrigian two-sector model (1965) and his investment model (1976). No mere theorist, however, Harcourt has stressed the need to apply real world economics (esp. accounting techniques) to deal with real world problems - which he views as the Post Keynesian signature. He apparently still splits his time between Adelaide and Jesus College, Cambridge.      Major works of Geoffrey C. Harcourt     Resources on G.C. Harcourt   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Harris was associated with Harvard for much of his life - earning his BA in 1920 and his Ph.D  in 1926.  Harris joined the Harvard faculty in 1922 as an instructor, remaining there for much of his career.  Harris started off as a relative conservative economist, and in his early tracts (e.g. 1934) was suspicious of the New Deal and advocated deflation. Seymour E. Harris was one of the chief post-war propagators of Keynesian theory and policy in the United States.  Editor of the Review of Economics and Statistics from 1943.  He was a frequent advisor to the U.S. government and held numerous official posts.  A prolific writer, Harris wrote numerous books not only on macroeconomics, but on a myriad of other subjects, notably education and health care. Allegedly as a result of Harvard's unsavory quota policy, Seymour E. Harris was the only Jewish member of the Harvard's department and had to wait eighteen years before earning tenure, becoming full professor only in 1945.

Roy F. Harrod, 1900-1978.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/harrod.htm," Roy Forbes Harrod taught economics, and produced his original contributions to the subject, at Oxford between 1924 and his retirement in 1967. Elected to a Lectureship at Christ Church Oxford in 1922, he then spent a few months at Cambridge with J.M. Keynes, with whom he remained in close touch for the rest of Keynes' life, and whose official biography he published in 1951.

With Hicks and Meade he was among the Oxford economists included in Keynes' circle of correspondents. A founder of the Oxford Economics Research Group along with Hubert Henderson and others, his unique contribution in urging a ""dynamic"" rather than ""static"" approach to economic issues was an Oxford contribution, accepted only later among the Cambridge economists.

A delay of two years, (1928 to 1930) in the publication by Keynes, then editor of the Economic Journal of Harrod's original ""marginal revenue curve"" denied the Oxford economist the primacy in this field.  This sad turn of circumstance was to repeat itself several times in Harrod's career. Another independent discovery by Harrod (1931), effectively the long-run envelope of short-run average cost curves, also went unrecognized - the credit being awarded to Viner. In that same article, he laid out the analytical foundations for the theory of imperfect competition - but Joan Robinson took the prize. The laurels for his remarkable multiplier-accelerator model, developed in his Trade Cycle (1936), were given to the mathematically-expressed versions by Samuelson and Hicks.  The equations of the IS-LM model were written down by Harrod (1937), but the (later) drawing of the diagram by Hicks robbed him of his claims to precedence. His 1939 paper on entrepreneurial behavior - one of the first statements of the idea that there are natural selection or ""evolutionary"" mechanisms towards profit-maximizing behavior - was largely ignored and left for Alchian (1950) to propose.

Finally, another discovery gave him some name recognition: Harrod's (1939) ""Essay in Dynamic Theory"". The idea, which marked the beginning of the modern theory of growth, had been followed up by Evsey Domar, but at least he got his name on the model this time: the ""Harrod-Domar Model"".  In his 1948 book, Towards a Dynamic Economics, as well as in a series of essays (1960, 1963, 1975) he developed this further, highlighting the  instability problem of this model and launching the entire post-war research program on economic growth - and, indeed, reviving business cycle theory as well.  His contributions to international trade (1933, 1958) and imperfect competition (1933, 1934, 1952) have also been given latter-day recognition. His less rigorous pieces on economic policy (1963, 1965, 1968, 1969) were also remarkable. He was appointed a Reader in Economics at Nuffield College, Oxford in 1952, and is remembered in a Fellowship in Applied Economics at that College.

Outside economic theory Harrod's claim to prominence was his work on inductive logic (1956), his role on the Statistical Staff and as personal adviser to Winston Churchill during WW II, and his unofficial advice to Harold MacMillan as Prime Minister.  He also devoted great energy to the life of his Oxford college.      Major works of Roy F. Harrod   Resources on Roy Harrod   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
John C. Harsanyi, 1920-2000,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/harsanyi.htm," Hungarian-American game theorist and  utilitarian philosopher at Berkeley. John C. Harsanyi was born in Budapest, the son of Jewish pharmacists. He studied pharmacology at the University of Budapest.  He evaded much of war, but in 1944 Harsanyi was arrested by Nazi authorities and deported to a concentration camp.  Harsanyi managed to escape, and was hidden in the basement a Jesuit chapter house.  After the war, Harsanyi completed his doctorate in philosophy and sociology at Budapest in 1946, but departed Hungary in 1948 after the ascent of the communist regime.  Harsanyi moved first to Australia, and enrolled at the University of Sydney to study economics, receiving his M.A. in 1953, from which emerged his first works on uncertainty and utilitarianism.  In 1956, Harsanyi went to the United States on a Rockefeller fellowship, receiving his Ph.D from Stanford under Kenneth J. Arrow in 1959, with a thesis on game theory. After a brief stints at Australian National University and Wayne State University in Detroit, Harsanyi joined the faculty at UC Berkeley in 1964. In utilitarian philosophy, Harsanyi's 1953 article derives social preferences from individual preferences using the argument of rational decision making under uncertainty with von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility.  Harsanyi anticipates John Rawls's ""veil of ignorance"" argument - specifically, Harsanyi identified ""social preferences"" as the preferences an individual would have if he thought there was an equal chance of being anyone in society.  He followed this up in 1955, and a series of other articles.  Harsanyi concludes that the social welfare criteria should be maximizing the average utility of society, rather than Bentham's total utility or Rawls's minimum utility.  His 1977 article puts Harsanyi as one of the more prominent advocates of a ""rule utilitarianism"" (as opposed to ""act utilitarianism"") conception of utilitarian ethics.      Harsanyi's 1967 papers introduced the concept of Bayesian games (games under uncertainty) in game theory. Harsanyi shared the Nobel memorial prize in 1994 with John Nash and Reinhard Selten.

Ralph G. Hawtrey, 1879-1971.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hawtrey.htm," British civil servant and monetary theorist. Ralph G. Hawtrey was educated Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, with a B.A. in mathematics in 1901.  Although he never attended any of Marshall's lectures at Cambridge, Ralph Hawtrey has been considered a Marshallian economist. This might be right. Although Hawtrey worked at the Treasury most of his life, entering in 1904, Hawtrey's numerous writings on economics have a unmistakable Cambridge hue.  Most notable is Hawtrey's contributions to the Cambridge cash-balance approach to money.  An early friend of John Maynard Keynes, Hawtrey was also an early critic of the Treatise. In his most famous work, Hawtrey adopted Wicksell's cumulative process to derive his famous 1919 overconsumptionist monetary theory of business cycles.      Major Works of Ralph G.

Friedrich A. Hayek, 1899-1992. ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hayek.htm,"  Among the most masterful and insightful of 20th Century economists, the Austrian economist Friedrich A. von Hayek alone could have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with his great rival, J.M. Keynes. Trained by Wieser and Böhm-Bawerk in the Austrian tradition at Vienna, F.A. Hayek nonetheless carved a distinct spot in the economic pantheon - in some ways more different from the Austrian School than that of his friend and intellectual companion, Ludwig von Mises. After some fundamental early contributions (e.g. his 1928 article is often credited with having introduced the concept of a fully intertemporal equilibrium), Hayek's early work was primarily in monetary cycle theory (1929, 1931, 1939). Drawing upon the ""cumulative process"" of Knut Wicksell and a Continental tradition of multi-sectoral overinvestment models, Hayek argued that when finance permitted investment to be greater than savings, then both desired investment and consumption demand cannot be met by actual output - thus there will be ""forced saving"" and changing degrees of ""capital intensity"" (with capital conceived in a very Austrian sense) changing output and employment. However, forced savings are not sustainable as capital goods demand will not be maintained if consumer goods producers are being dried of consumption demand. Thus, there is a contraction in output and a subsequent fall in capital intensity. Hayek argued that this ""concertina"" process was the main motor behind business cycles. Hayek presented his main treatise on monetary cycle theory in a slim book, Prices and Production (1931), in England and was immediately drafted by Lord Robbins to join the L.S.E. - where he would serve as that institution's answer to Cambridge's John Maynard Keynes who was then working on similar issues. Keynes did not take lightly the criticisms Hayek made of his Treatise on Money (1930), and thus Keynes and Sraffa joined forces to bury Hayek and his cycle theory in the Economic Journal in 1932. At the L.S.E., Hayek was instrumental in furthering its then-novel ""continental"" bent and he was highly influential on his junior colleagues (such as Hicks) and students (which included Lerner and Kaldor). However, following the appearance of the General Theory by J.M. Keynes in 1936, Lerner and Kaldor, like the rest of the economics profession, were drawn away from Hayek's orbit. Kaldor's departure was particularly stinging - since his subsequent criticisms of the ""Ricardo Effect"" upon which Hayek was hanging the remnants of a shredded cycle theory, led Hayek to abandon his cycle theory entirely. Hayek's attempted to work a new system in his Pure Theory of Capital (1941), which he originally envisioned as a part of a larger work.  In it, he attempted to develop a joint theory of investment and capital.  Inexplicably, his 1941 book fell dead-born from the press and proved to be his last substantial effort in the area of theoretical Neoclassical economics.   Nonetheless, many of the Hayekian capital themes would emerge later in the theory of investment by his students, notably Friedrich and Vera Lutz and Abba Lerner and, more distantly, Trygve Haavelmo. Hayek turned in 1944 to the political arena with his Road to Serfdom, a polemical defense of laissez-faire - the work for which he is best known outside academia. His subsequent political activities include the foundation of the libertarian ""Mont Pelerin Society"" in the 1940s. In 1935, Hayek had edited a book on the Socialist Calcuation debate in which Mises had been engaged. In resurrecting Barone's 1908 article, Hayek realized that the Mises attack on the socialist position was untenable. As a result, in several famous articles - notably, ""Economics and Knowledge"" (1937) and ""On the Use of Knowledge in Society"" (1945) - Hayek composed a response which advanced the ""Socialist Calculation"" debate to a new level. Succinctly, he claimed, countering Lange and the Paretians, that prices are not merely ""rates of exchange between goods"", but rather ""a mechanism for communicating information"" (Hayek, 1945). Hayek argued that people have little knowledge of the world beyond their immediate surroundings and this is what forces them to be price-takers - the crucial ingredient that makes the price system work. If, on the other hand, a particular agent's knowledge were greater, agents would then refuse to act as price-takers but rather make decisions in a way which would manipulate their environment to their advantage thereby destroying the price system. In a complex, uncertain environment, Hayek argument, agents are not able to predict the consequences of their actions, and only this way could the price system work. In Hayek's words, the ""fatal conceit"" of the Oskar Lange and other ""Socialists"" in the calculation debate was that they believed this order could be ""designed"" by a planner who just gets the prices right, without realising that a price system evolved spontaneously as a result of lack of knowledge. The same limited knowledge which afflicts the agent's predictive power must necessarily constrain the planner's as well. Hayek enhanced this argument with considerations of ""spontaneous order"" - the idea that a harmonious, evolving order arises from the interaction of a decentralized, heterogeneous group of self-seeking agents with limited knowledge. This order, he claimed, was not ""designed"" nor could be ""designed"" by a social planner, even a very wise one, but merely ""emerged"" or evolved spontaneously from a seemingly complex network of interaction among agents with limited knowledge. Hayek's elaborations on this complex, evolving spontaneous order are found in various places (e.g. 1952, 1964). Hayek continued with his work on ""evolving order"", linking it with his work on political and legal theory (e.g. 1960, 1973). In tackling the evolution of political, social, legal and economic institutions, Hayek is rightly conceived as one of the founding fathers of ""evolutionary economics"". In many ways, one can see how the work of the social ""evolutionist"" and skeptic philosopher, David Hume was particularly influential on Hayek. Indeed, Hayek's scholarly work on the history of economic thought - e.g. on John Stuart Mill, Richard Cantillon and the Bullionist Debates - often echoed his search for bedfellows in the past, those who had resisted the ""rational"", calculable worldviews and simplistic solutions ever-so-present within intellectual circles. In his work on the philosophy of science (1952), Hayek traces the intellectual roots of the rational-socialist tendencies of economics to the French tradition of  Saint-Simon and Comte in the 19th Century. Hayek's efforts were nonetheless ignored in the Keynesian mainstream which then dominated economics. Finding a deaf ear in economics, he looked elsewhere. In an apparently bizarre interlude, Hayek turned his attention to psychology - turning out an anti-behaviorist (and Hume-drenched) tract, The Sensory Order (1952), which fit into his ""group selection"" type of evolution he had applied to his ""spontaneous order"" in economics. All this led to one of his most famous works, the Constitution of Liberty (1960) bringing all his previous work on political theory together into one magnificent defense of ""Old Whig"" political doctrine and a return attack on the Saint-Simon-Comte collectivism. Having seen his old idea of a ""commodity reserve currency"" (1943) fail to generate much interest, Hayek turned in the 1970s to champion the cause of a ""free banking system"" originally proposed by Vera Smith Lutz and the devolution of monetary control away from the central banks and into the hands of private banks (1978). This drew upon him the opposition of Milton Friedman and the Chicago Monetarists. After spending many fruitful years at the L.S.E., Hayek joined the Committee on Social Thought (not the economics department) of the University of Chicago in 1950. In 1962, Hayek left for the University of Freiburg in Germany and subsequently Salzburg, where he spent his remaining years. Hayek shared the Nobel Prize with Gunnar Myrdal in 1974 in one of the more controversial and surprising awards ever made (controversial because Myrdal had called for the abolition of the Nobel prize as a result of it having been awarded to Hayek and Friedman, and surprising for, at that time, Hayek was virtually forgotten in the economics profession). Interest in Hayek and his work increased after the 1974 award (his Nobel speech being a reiteration of his Counterrevolution thesis) and has kept on that track until today - his stock being enormously boosted by the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe.

Future heavyweights Cairnes and Cliffe-Leslie were Hearn's classmates and the slightly older J.K. Ingram was still around.  Hearn graduated in 1847, and went on to become professor of Greek at Queen's College Galway.  Hearn emigrated to Australia in 1854, to become professor at the University of Melbourne, teaching economics among other subjects. William E. Hearn's 1863 economics treatise Plutology was drawn in part from his reading of the work of John Rae and the Oxford-Dublin school (esp. Longfield).  Hearn vigorously disputed the Classical school doctrines and stressed the role of demand side of price-determination.  Although used as a textbook in Australia, Hearn apparently made only one disciple (the inventor Wordsworth Donisthorpe) back in England.

Georg W.F. Hegel, 1770-1831.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hegel.htm," German philosopher of the post-Enlightenment Romantic era. Highly influential on both the Marxian School. and the German Historical School.  Originally from Stuttgart, Duchy of Württemberg, the son of a bureaucrat. Originally aiming for a Protestant clerical career, Georg W.F. Hegel studied theology at the University of Tübingen, where he came into contact with Kantian philosophy and the budding German Romantic movement, principally through his classmates F.W.J. Schelling and Friedrich Hölderlin.  After a period as a private tutor in Bern and Frankfurt, Hegel became a lecturer at the University of Jena in 1801, near the Romanticist citadel of Weimar, then at its height under Goethe and Schiller.  Hegel composed his philosophical masterpiece, the Phenomenology of the Mind while at Jena in 1807, but was forced to move on by the travails of the Napoleonic wars. After a period as editor of a Bamberg newspaper, Hegel became  a schoolteacher in Nuremberg. During this time, Hegel wrote his works on objective and subjective logic (1812-13, 1816). After the war, Hegel returned to academia, taking up a post at the University of Heidelberg in 1816. Finding his works on logic were too advanced for his Heidelberg students, Hegel composed a briefer outline (Encyclopaedia, 1817).  Hegel then moved on to the University of Berlin in 1818, where he would remain the rest of his life. Hegel's lectures on law (1821) were published in his lifetime.  His lectures on the philosophy of religion (1832), history of philosophy (1833-36), aesthetics (1835-37) and philosophy of history (1837) would be published posthumously, organized by his students. Hegel emphasized the primacy of human ideas in determining the course of history. Hegel articulated a complex metaphysics, which explained the evolution of history in terms of the separation of ""subject"" (roughly man's consciousness) from ""object"" (e.g. the human condition). These had once been united in what Hegel called a primordial ""Absolute Spirit"", but had since become separated, thus man's understanding of his world was imperfect. But it was not static. Hegel had posited that man's understanding of reality is a matter of ideas and concepts.  But these ideas are constantly changing and being re-interpreted by a process Hegel called ""dialectic"", where an idea (thesis) is proposed, then criticized by an opposite idea (antithesis), yielding a new idea (synthesis), which then becomes the basis of the next thesis.  And the process repeats itself.  Hegel viewed history as the progress of civilization in terms of changing human consciousness, accelerated by increasing human freedom, towards achieving a final reunion (""totality"") of human consciousness and the world around him. Hegel's confidence in teleological progress included the suggestion in his 1821 Philosophy of Right tract that the current Prussian state was the culmination of political perfection. Earlier in his life, Hegel had been an enthusiast of the French Revolution, but had grown disenchanted with age.  Hegel found that it had resolved nothing, that the revolution had not cleared the way to the common good or the ""general will"" of the Enlightenment philosophers, but merely opened a new chapter of conflict between social classes.  Notably, Hegel saw that the new post-revolutionary bourgeois society was riven with strife between employers (capital) and the employed (labor).  As their perspectives and moral views tended to be specific to their particular interests, Hegel saw that only the State could serve as a disinterested, impartial party. Hegel characterized the State civil service as the class having a 'universal' point of view, that transcended the particular interests of other social groups, and could serve as the agent of the common good.  But Hegel's exaltation of the Prussian bureaucracy seemed much too conservative for his students, many of whom were lured by ideas of liberalism and even radical socialism.  They looked abroad, to Britain and, particularly after the 1830 July Revolution, to France, which seemed to offer freer alternatives to Prussian authoritarianism.  They began raising doubts whether Hegel's idealized state was really embodied in the Prussian state around them, and became critical of the established order. Shortly after Hegel's death in 1831, his students in Berlin would form the ""Young Hegelian"" movement, using Hegelian logic to argue for political reform in the Prussian state, arguing for more liberalism, democratization and secularism.  If it is ideas that determine history, then deliberately changing ideas is a way to change society. They were initially encouraged by the ascension of King Frederick William IV to the Prussian throne in 1840, promising a new era of liberalism, but were to be sharply disappointed. . But some went even deeper, and questioned the direction of causality in his philosophy.  Young Hegelians, like Bruno Bauer and Ludwig Feuerbach,  adopted Hegel's methods, but turned it against Hegel's relentless idealism. The Young Hegelians began to reverse Hegel's theory, and suggesting that it was the society and the course of history that determined human ideas (what Feuerbach called ""naturalism""), rather than the other way around.  The Young Hegelian reversal reached its apex with the ""historical materialism"" of Karl Marx, which emphasized material economic basis as the prime determinant of ideas, that changes in society were brought not by changing ideas, but only by changing economic conditions. The German Historical School was less directly connected to Hegel and the Young Hegelians, but certainly drew on them for inspiration.      Major Works of Georg W.F.

Eduard Heimann, 1889-1967,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/heimann.htm," German economist from Hamburg, and Christian Socialist. Eduard Magnus Mortier Heimann was born in Berlin, Germany, to a prosperous family of Jewish descent.  His father, Hugo Heimann, was a publisher and Social Democratic politician.  After finishing high school in 1908, Eduard Heimann studied economics at Heidelberg, Vienna and Berlin, absorbing a variety of economic schools - Marxist, Neoclassical, Historicist - at each location.  He obtained his doctorate under Alfred Weber.at Heidelberg, although he would later cite Franz Oppenheimer as his biggest influence.  For medical reasons, Heeimann was exempted from military service during WWI, and worked instead in the private sector plants for a few years.  In 1919, Hemann was elected general secretary of the first socialization committee, that pushed for the nationalization of coal and steel, and also participated in the second committee of 1920.  Returning to academia, he submitted his habilitation thesis at the University of Freiburg in 1922, and lectured there until 1925, when he was appointed to the University of Hamburg.  Heimann continued to be an active public intellectual, participating in nationwide debates on social policy.  It was already early in this period that Heimann grew dissatisfied with the materialism of Marxism, and was drawn into the Christian Socialist circle of Paul Tillich and Martin Buber. Heimann departed sufficiently from Marxian theory to provide it with a ""idealistic"" edge, almost to the extreme of Manchester School liberalism. After the Nazis took power in 1933, Eduard Heimann was promptly dismissed from his post.  Heimann emigrated to New York, joining ""University in Exile"" at the New School for Social Research, where he taught until 1958.  His History of Economic Doctrines is a classic in the HET.

Claude-Adrien Helvétius, 1715-1771 ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/helvetius.htm," French tax farmer, philanthropist and Enlightenment philosopher, Claude-Adrien Helvétius is widely regarded as a father of utilitarianism.   Born in Paris, Helvétius's name suggests a Swiss origin, but in fact his family, surnamed Schweitzer (later latinized to Helvétius), originated from the German Palatinate of the Rhine.  They had  fled to Holland during the wars of religion.  His grandfather had been a famous alchemist and a doctor in the Dutch army,  and subsequently emigrated to France to serve in the medical corps of the armies of Louis XIV.  His own father had risen to the position of royal physician to the French queen, and written several notable medical tracts.   His father's fortunes had, however, suffered from the machinations of the Cardinal Fleury, and he determined to set his son to rebuild the family fortune, and apprenticed him to a wealthy relative, a director of tax-farms in Caen. . By his father's connections to the queen, Claude-Adrien Helvétius obtained the position of tax farmer in the lucrative ferme générale by the age of twenty-three, and soon accumulated a vast fortune (substantial parts of which he gave away to charitable causes).   Never much given to business or court life,  Helvétius dedicated much of his spare time to speculative philosophy, poetry and mathematics.  Helvétius read John Locke in his youth, and considered himself an ardent Lockean disciple.  The success of his friend Montesquieu's  L'ésprit des lois in 1748 inspired him to try to change career and join the fledgling ""republic of letters"".   Helvétius resigned his tax-farming position in 1751 to retreated to his estates in Perche and dedicated himself to studying philosophy. After years of solitary study, Helvétius's finally published (anonymously) his grand treatise, De l'ésprit in 1758  It was an immediate succès de scandale..  The book was widely-read and promptly condemned by the Sorbonne, the Pope and the Parlement of Paris and burnt by the public executioner.  The tidal wave of indignation overturned other boats. Although Helvétius did not contribute to the famous Encyclopédie, and Diderot even directed a polemical tract against him, the French authorities believed his dangerous ideas were fostered by it and thus the Encyclopédie was suppressed.  Like Condillac, Helvétius took a radical empiricist position, that man was born a tabula rasa and formed his knowledge from the senses and association of ideas.  A radical hedonist, Helvétius argued that actions and judgments are generated by the natural desire (common to man and animals) to maximize pleasure and minimize pain.   Consequently, human  behavior is completely determined by education and social environment.  He was condemned precisely because this deterministic theory of man seemed to exonerate immoral behavior.   However, Helvétius believed that human behavior could be made virtuous and socially beneficial just by setting up the appropriate pleasure/pain incentives and thereby channeling it in the right direction.  His emphasis on education (particularly the importance of providing motivation to students) was particularly well-regarded. ""Men are born ignorant, not stupid"", Helvétius argued, but ""they are made stupid by education"".  Rousseau, however, dedicated several passages of his Emile (which enjoyed its own succès de scandale) against him. Helvétius was perhaps the first to articulate the utilitarian formula of defining social welfare as the ""greatest happiness of the greatest number"".  His ideas were highly influential on Pietro Verri, Cesare Beccaria and, through them, the British utilitarians.  With scandal surrounding him, Helvétius did not publish again in his lifetime. The remainder of his works, including De l'homme, an explication of his earlier treatise which was even more uncompromising (it contained a denunciation of all religion), were published only after his death.  Some final notes of family curiosa: his wife, Anne Catherine ""Minette"" de Ligniville, was a renowned beauty in her day and very well-connected -- she was related not only to Voltaire's mistress, the Marquise du Chatelet, but also Queen Marie Antoinette herself (thus ensuring Helvétius's appointment as the queen's tutor).  After his death, she famously became the object of old Benjamin Franklin's amorous attentions.        Resources on Helvétius   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Friedrich B.W. Hermann, 1795-1868.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hermann.htm," Bavarian teacher, Cameralist economist, statistician and proto-marginalist. Born in Dinkelsbühl (Bavarian Franconia),  Friedrich Benedict Wilhelm von Hermann studied at the Universities of Erlangen and Würzburg. He became a mathematics teacher at private school in Erlangen in 1817, transferring to its high school in 1821.  In 1823, he took a secondary appointment as a lecturer in Cameralist economics at the University of  Würzburg, submitting a thesis on the ancient Roman economy. In 1825, Hermann was appointed professor of mathematics at a newly-founded Polytechnic School of Nuremberg, producing a popular  mathematics textbook. Two years later, in 1827, Hermann became an associate professor of Kameralwissenschaft (political economy) at the University of Munich. Hermann's principal claim to fame is his 1832 economics textbook, Staatswirtschaftliche Untersuchungen. Here, Hermann introduced perhaps the earliest statement of economic theory wholly in demand-and-supply form.  He is thus regarded as one of the leading proto-marginalists in Germany.   Purportedly, Hermann was highly influential upon Carl Menger. Hermann's 1832 treatise enabled his promotion to ordinary professorship at Munich in 1833.  From 1836 he was employed by the Bavarian government as an inspector of technical schools and, from 1839, a member of the Bavarian statistical bureau.   Hermann was appointed consultant to the Bavarian ministry of the interior from 1845. Politically liberal, Hermann represented Munich at the Frankfurt Assembly in 1848. He was a founding member of the ""Greater Germany"" Party (Grossdeutsche Partei), which promoted inclusion of Austria in a unitary German nation-state, as a counter-balance to Prussia. Nominated councilor of state in 1855,  Herman left politics and focused almost entirely on his work for the statistical bureau.  He finished revisions for a second edition of his economics text just weeks before his death in November 1868.      Major Works of F.B.W.

Sir John R.Hicks, 1904-1989.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hicks.htm," One of the most important and influential economists of the twentieth century, the trail of the eternally eclectic John Richard Hicks is found all over economic theory.   Although trained at Balliol College, Oxford, his ""real"" education began in the late 1920s, after he appointed to the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1926.   Under the encouragement of Lionel Robbins and others, he used his magnificent proficiency in many European tongues to absorb the economics treatises of Continental Europe.  Thus seeped in the Lausanne, Austrian, and Swedish tradition, John Hicks began to break the Marshallian hold on Anglo-Saxon economics in the 1930s --  what we have called the great Paretian tide that consolidated the Marginalist Revolution begun over fifty years beforehand. John Hicks's classic Value and Capital (1939) was a battering ram of that movement.  The precepts of that book had already been announced elsewhere. On the microeconomic side, Hicks's 1930 article and 1932 book, Theory of Wages was an attempt at a careful and complete restatement of the marginal productivity theory (it was there that he introduced his famous ""elasticity of substitution"").  In his famous 1934 paper with R.G.D.Allen, Hicks introduced the Slutsky decomposition of demand into substitution and income effects, defined substitution and complementarity clearly and reacquainted English-speaking economists with the derivation of demand curves with the use of indifference curves and budget constraints and the equation between marginal rates of substition and relative prices. His review article on ""Monopoly"" (1935) introduced the concept of ""conjectural variations"" as a way of uniting various theories of imperfect competition, but it was really his first and last stab at this subject. His paper on ""Léon Walras"" (1934) was an attempt at a resurrection of the then-forgotten Lausanne School. His review of Myrdal's work (1934) was a similar attempt to draw attention to the Stockholm School. On the macroeconomics side, his 1931 article on Knightian theory and his 1933 article on the business cycle under the influence of Hayek were his first macroeconomic ventures - both exhibiting the L.S.E. stamp. His 1935 ""Suggestion for Simplifying the Theory of Money"" was a bold call for the integration of money and value theory - away from the simplistic Quantity Theory and towards a more choice- theoretic version along Walrasian lines. It was parallel to Keynes's ""liquidity preference"" and indeed, later portfolio theory.   It is notable that his work on money was independent of his work on the business cycle: throughout his life, despite his magnificent contributions to monetary theory, Hicks maintained that the source of macrofluctuations must be found in ""real"" phenomena. This faith was tested upon the appearance of J.M. Keynes's General Theory.  Hicks's 1936 review was remarkably good, but it was his 1937 paper, ""Mr. Keynes and the Classics"", where Hicks introduced the IS-LM model (and that diagram) that provided the launching pad for the Neo-Keynesian synthesis. It was in that same 1937 paper that the concept of a ""liquidity trap"" was introduced. Hicks happened to be Cambridge at this time - newly-married to fellow economist Ursula Webb, Hicks had left the LSE in 1935, and become a fellow at at Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge,  But he soon moved on, leaving Cambridge in 1938 to take the Jevons Chair in political economy at the University of Manchester. It was Manchester that Hicks put the final touches to his magnum opus. Hicks wove his different strands of thought into Value and Capital (1939). Much of modern microeconomics and general equilibrium theory has its roots in this book. The concept of ""composite commodity"" and the conditions for stability of general equilibrium were laid out there, as well as a more complete reworking of the theory of  utility-based demand. His 1935 ""Suggestion"" and his work on Keynes (1936, 1937) found their way into the macroeconomic section - particularly in the discussion on liquidity preference and loanable funds theories of interest. He also developed the concept of ""temporary equilibrium"" (defined by a sequence of Hicksian ""weeks"" with expectations dividing them) that had been employed by the Stockholm School. He attempted a formulation of capital along Swedish-Austrian lines, but with less success. A 1939 article announced Hicks's move into the ""New Welfare Economics"" in earnest . In it, he introduced what has now become known as the ""Hicks Compensation Criteria"" of ordering allocations. In a series of other articles (1940, 1941, 1942, 1944, 1946, 1958), which come together in his Revision of Demand Theory (1956), Hicks resurrected Marshall's concept of consumer's surplus and introduced and expanded upon the idea of ""compensating variations"" and ""equivalent variations"" as measures of welfare change. Hicks left Manchester in 1946 and returned to Oxford, initially as a fellow of the graduate-oriented Nuffield College, but from 1952 as Drummond Professor of Political Economy (succeeding H.D. Henderson) and the associated fellow of All Souls (Hicks took early retirement in 1965, in exchange for a research fellowship at All Souls, yielding the Drummond Chair to R.C.O. Matthews).  Hicks was knighted in 1964. Although having produced a popular textbook (Social Framwork, 1942) and been engaged in all sorts of policy-oriented endeavours, Hicks continued his advance in macroeconomics through the 1950s, turning this time to growth and cycle theory. Roy Harrod's work (which he reviewed in 1949) caught his attention and led him to give unto the world his Contribution to the Theory of the Trade Cycle (1950), which developed a Harrodian multiplier- accelerator mechanism with ceilings and floors, thereby constraining Harrod's instability problem and yielding cyclical behavior. Still intrigued, he continued to concentrate on issue of equilibrium and disequilibrium growth paths. His encounter with the von Neumann growth model and the related work by Samuelson and Solow, yielded his remarkably clear 1960 article exposition of ""Linear Theory"" and, most importantly, his 1961 article on the von Neumann turnpike. In an attempt to clarify his thinking on growth and capital, which was then coming under fire in the Cambridge Capital Controversy, (for Hicks's thoughts on the subject, see 1960, 1961), John Hicks gave us his Capital and Growth in 1965. In this second magnum opus, Hicks hammered together his previous work on Keynesian, Harrodian, von Neumann and capital theory, with a good sprinkling of Lindahl, into an attempt at a comprehensive re-examination of growth theory. His taxonomy - dividing models into fix-price and flex-price models - led him to further concerns, particularly the issue of the ""traverse"" (the movement from one growth equilibrium to another). The first part of Capital and Growth was reworked and republished as Methods of Economic Dynamics in 1985. Hicks's concern with capital and growth throughout this time had left money out of the picture (his 1962 article being an exception). He addressed this in 1967 with his Critical Essays on Monetary Theory. There Hicks attempted a similar clarificiation and reworking of different theories of money. Sensing that these theories were not all quite right, he decided to fish for a better concept of money in economic history, giving us his remarkable Theory of Economic History (1969) and his posthumous Market Theory of Money (1989), which stressed the then-novel concept of a credit theory of exchange. Nonetheless, capital and growth were still Hicks's primary concern. After a 1970 foray, Hicks turned to Austrian economics and single-handedly attempted a resurrection of Austrian capital theory in his 1973 book, Capital and Time. It was an attempt at formalizing an Austrian theory of capital which included both fixed and circulating capital. He then changed tack again and turned to exploring some important methodological issues which had been gathering during his work on growth and capital. The first was time - and notably, the concept of irreversibility of time and causality in time. This was the body of his 1976 contribution to the Georgescu-Roegen festschrift and also his 1979 book, Causality in Economics. Here, in his 1974 Crisis in Keynesian Economics, in his 1980 paper ""IS-LM: An explanation"" and elsewhere (1981-3, 1984, 1988), Hicks denounced the pretence, method and theory of the very Neoclassical-Keynesian Synthesis he had helped create and pointed the way to new developments along more Post Keynesian lines. These and other works on methodology and the history of economics dominated the rest of his life. How is one to assess an economist whose legacy runs as wide and deep as that of John Hicks? The quintessential ""economist's economist"", Hicks cannot be said to have founded a ""school"" - unless one were to count the generation of eclectic and critical Neo-Walrasian theorists inspired by his visionary but careful work, such as Morishima, Hahn and Negishi. But Hicks was for the most part a lone thinker, part of every school and thus part of no school. If any, his school was ""economics"". Hicks himself claimed to have created no new economics but simply to have spent his life understanding, formulating and channeling the ideas of the Continental and Keynesian schools and his own historical, philosophical and practical reflections. In a sense, he may have been right - but he analyzed and extended them in a meaningful and challenging way and thus transformed economics in the process. In many ways, Hicks's scholarly output is a perfect demonstration of how economics should be done: without partisanship for pet theories, without ideological quibbling, his own strictest critic, learning from all and everywhere, constantly searching for new ideas and staying glued to none. Hicks's approach to economics was informed by all the best qualities of the scientist, poet, philosopher and practical man, and he let none of these tendencies overreach themselves and overwhelm any other. In this sense, no economist before or since Hicks, has achieved such ""Olympian"" scholarship. John Hicks was a professor at Oxford for most of his life and shared the Nobel prize in 1972 with another rare and valuable specimen, Kenneth J.Arrow.  The Nobel Committee could not have chosen a better pair.       Major Works of John Hicks     Resources on John Hicks All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Bruno Hildebrand, 1812-1878.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/brunohildebrand.htm,"  German Historicist of the ""older"" school.  Bruno Hildebrand was trained in history in the University of Breslau.  He moved on to a teaching position at the University of Marburg, where he crossed paths with younger historicist, Karl Knies.   In 1848, Hildebrand published his famous radical methodological treatise.  Hildebrand relentlessly attacked Classical Ricardian economic theory for being materialistic, universalistic and cosmopolitan.  Not only did he not believe in natural ""economic laws"", as advocated by the Ricardians, he also rejected all ""laws"" of historical development that had been put forth by his fellow historicist, Wilhelm Roscher.   Instead, Hildebrand wanted a general ""theory of everything"", a holistic but relativistic Staatswissenschaften.   Nonetheless, Hildebrand later contradicted his own precepts, developing a quite distinct ""linear stages"" theory of economic history.   It was Hildebrand who was primarily responsible for the stages theory of money, whereby exchange economies pass linearly from Naturalwirtschaft (barter economy) to Geldwirtschaft (gold/commodity money economy) and finally Kreditwirtschaft (credit economy).  Despite historical evidence to the contrary, Hildebrand's theory has found its way into economic folklore.  During 1848, the year of revolutions, Hildebrand served as a liberal deputy in the famous Frankfurt constitutional assembly. When that ill-fated political adventure collapsed, Hildebrand was forced to resign his academic chair and went into a decade-long exile in Switzerland.  There, he taught at the universities of Zurich and Bern, and worked for the local statistical bureaus.    In 1861, Hildebrand returned to Germany to take up a post as professor at the University of Jena.  He concentrated primarily on contemporary empirics and statistics, thereby not making much use of the Historicist method.  Nonetheless, Hildebrand became the primary link between the ""Older"" and ""Younger"" strands of the German Historical School.  His famous ""Jena Seminar"" was the breeding ground for the next generation.   In 1863, Hildebrand launched the Jährbucher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik (JNS) which was to become one of the leading Historicist journals, which he would pass on to his son-in-law Johannes Conrad in 1878.  Hildebrand also helped found the Verein für Sozialpolitik in 1872.      Major Works of Bruno Hildebrand   Resources on Bruno Hildebrand   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Popularizer and propounder of the ""economic"" reading of Karl Marx, Hilferding was one of the leading Marxian theorists of his day, identified with the ""Austro-Marxian"" group. He was the main responder (1904) to the challenge to Marx by fellow Viennese, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk.   Hilferding also participated in the Crises Debate - disputing Marx's theory of the instability and eventual breakdown of capitalism on the basis that the concentration of capital is actually stabilizing (1910). Hilferding served with Kautsky in the German Socialization Committee in 1918. He was a member of parliament for the Social Democratic Party in Germany and also served as the German Minister of Finance in 1923 and 1928-9.

Albert O. Hirschman, 1915-2012,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hirschman.htm," Maverick economist, Albert O. Hirschman, was a world traveler: born in Berlin, educated in Paris, London and Trieste (from where he obtained his Ph.D.), fought in the French Army in 1940, emigrated to the United States in 1941, stayed two years at Berkeley, joined the US Army, joined the Federal Reserve in Washington in 1946, lived in Bogota, Colombia from 1952 to 1956, and then onto Yale, Columbia and Harvard before finally settling at Princeton in 1974. Albert O. Hirschman lived in the grey zone between economic and political theory. His first book (1945) outlined how economic power is often the handmaiden of political power between states. This helped engender a good degree of skepticism about the manner in which the Marshall Plan was conducted in Europe in the 1940s. It was in Colombia, however, that Hirschman began to formulate his better known theories of development. As outlined in his 1958 Strategy of Development, Hirschman revolted against the importation and application of conventional economic doctrinal prescriptions for economic development. Rather, he insisted that economic development should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, exploiting indigenous resources and structures to achieve the desired results. Imposing a unifrom doctrinal structure, regardless of local circumstances, Hirschman argued, was a sure-fire recipe for disasterous development. Developed and underdeveloped economies, Hirschman argued, had ""hidden rationalities"" and it is the job of the development economist to exploit these and harness development planning to them. Hirschman's ""forward and backward linkages"" concept has been one of the most used terms in economic development theory since. In a sense, then, Hirschman anticipates (or follows) the doctrinal imperialism of economic theory in the Chicago vein. Hirschman's study of the interaction of consumer sovereignty and competitive structure led to his other famous book, Exit, Voice and Loyalty (1970).      Major Works of Albert O.

Thomas Hobbes, 1588-1679.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hobbes.htm," The English natural law philosopher Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury lived during some of the most tumultuous times in European history -- consequently, it should be no surprise that his theories were thoroughly pessimistic regarding human nature.  Born near Malmesbury, the early death of his father, an impoverished local vicar, brought young Thomas Hobbes under the care of his wealthy uncle.  At the age of fourteen, he entered Magdalen College, Oxford, and took his B.A. five years later.  In 1608, he acquired a post as a tutor to the son of William Cavendish, Earl of Devonshire.  This gave him time to devote himself to the Classics.  Disenchanted by Aristotlean acrobatics, Hobbes eagerly embraced the historian Thucydides (whose book he translated and published in 1628).  After his first tour of Europe in 1610, he made the acquaintance of Francis Bacon. However, he only became converted to the scientific outlook in the 1630s, after being seduced by Euclid's Geometry and hobnobbing with European scientists (particularly, the circle of Abbé Mersenne) during a tour of the continent.   Hobbes was particularly entranced by Galileo's reverse vision of dynamics.  Contrary to Buridan, Galileo claimed that the natural state of objects was one of motion, rather than rest.  Things, he argued always moved unless something stopped them. After meeting Galileo in 1636, Hobbes sought to apply this idea to a comprehensive social philosophy.  He envisioned this in three parts.  In the first part, of Body, he would relate the general laws of motion; in the second, of Man, he would show how humans can be considered bodies in motion (motivated by sensations, desires, appetites, etc.) and how they are impacted by external motions; in the third part, of the Citizen, he would give the results of these dynamic human interactions on the body politic.   Given the escalation of events between King and Parliament in England, Hobbes decided to reverse the order of appearance of the books.  In 1640, he published his Elements (1640), containing a sketch of the second and third parts.  As his book seemed to support the King against the claims of Parliament, Hobbes began fearing for his welfare, and so, later that same year, departed for Paris, where he would remain in hiding for the next eleven years.  Hobbes came into the orbit of Mersenne's circle once again and, for some of time, served as the mathematics tutor of a young, fugitive prince who would later become King Charles II.   In 1642, Hobbes's De Cive came out, a more detailed and formal analysis of the third part of his scheme.  Seeing that it had little impact in England, Hobbes set out writing a new treatise which would explain his theory in a more down-to-earth manner.  The result was Leviathan (1651). Leviathan (1651) was clearly Hobbes's masterpiece.  Man is not naturally good, Hobbes claimed, but naturally a selfish hedonist -- ""of the voluntary acts of every man, the object is some good to himself"".  As human motives were, in their natural state, guided by unenlightened self-interest, these could, if left unchecked, have highly destructive consequences.  Left unrestrained, humans, propelled by their internal dynamics, would crash against each other.  Hobbes tried to envision what society would be like in a ""state of nature"" -- before any civil state or rule of law.  His conclusion was despiriting: life would be ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short"", a ""war of every man against every man"".   Nonetheless, as all people are equal (in a physical not a moral sense),  possessing a passionate love of survival (right of nature) and some degree of rationality (law of nature), Hobbes concluded that a viable, working society would arise as an equilibrium between these competing forces.  The logic is simple.  Any person's right of nature justifies violence against everybody else. Consequently, in the interests of personal survival, people will come around to agreeing that they should renounce their right to use violence.  However, this yields up a tense and unstable equilibrium.  The moment one party deviates from their promise, all will deviate and war restarts.   To keep society going with peace and confidence, then an artifice -- a Leviathan --  must be worked into the social contract.  This Leviathan is the State -- whether in the form of an absolute monarch or a democratic parliament, it does not matter.  The important point is that the State will be given a monopoly on violence and absolute authority.  In return, the State promises to exercise its absolute power to maintain a state of peace (by punishing deviants, etc.)  Realizing that its power depends wholly on the willingness of the citizenry to surrender theirs, the State itself will have an incentive not to abuse it.  Of course, there is no guarantee that it won't.  But when it does, it must brace itself for the consequences.    One of the interesting elements of Hobbes's story is that concepts like morality, liberty, justice, property, etc. have no natural, intrinsic or eternal meaning.  They are pure social constructions.  They are generated and imposed by the Leviathan, through his laws and institutions, to keep war and social disorder at bay. As history has shown, no set of values will last forever but will evolve as circumstances change.  Hobbes is particularly keen to note that law itself is completely dependent on power.  A law without a credible and powerful authority behind it is just simply not a law in any meaningful sense.  Hobbes is thus one of the progenitors of ""legal positivism"", i.e. that justice is whatever the law says it is.  An ""unjust law"" is simply an oxymoron.    In the context of the age, Hobbes's theory seemed to argue that Parliament's rebellion was illegitimate as long as Charles was king.  But once the head of King Charles I fell, then all rebellion against the Parliament becomes illegitimate.  For Hobbes, power legitimates, power is justice. The State -- whatever its form -- is always, by definition, right, as long as it is capable of maintaining civil peace.  Accused of being a turncoat by royalist exiles in France, Hobbes returned to England soon after the publication of Leviathan and presented himself before the Council of State.  Soon after, he published his other two other volumes of his philosophical trilogy -- De corpore (1655) and De homine (1657).      For the most part, Hobbes tried to live inconspicuously in London, but he was quickly drawn into a series of rather long-winded debates.  His first was with John Bramall, bishop of Derry, on the issue of free will (see 1654, 1658, 1682).  In 1655, Hobbes had claimed to be able to deduce the area of a circle by integration.  The mathematician John Wallis repudiation his claims and Hobbes went on the counteract, publishing a series of tracts (1656, 1657) denouncing Wallis and the ""new"" methods of mathematical analysis.  In 1661, he widened his attack to include Robert Boyle and the fledgling Royal Society.  Hobbes called a truce with his Mr. Hobbes Considered (1662). After the Restoration of 1660, King Charles II made Hobbes an intimate and granted him an pension.  In the confusion after the Great Fire of 1666, the House of Commons placed Hobbes's Leviathian on a bill of proscribed books.  Through the intervention of the king, the bill didn't pass through the Lords, but henceforth, the king asked that Hobbes vet his publications with him first.  Hobbes complied and most of his remaining political works were published after his death.  Two of them deserve special mention: his 1681 Dialogue attacking Common Law and defending royal prerogative and his 1682 Behemoth, a controversial history of the Long Parliament and the Civil War.  His final years were spent in writing his autobiography and translating the Iliad and Odyssey of Homer. Generally regarded as one of the most prominent ""natural law"" philosophers of the 17th Century, Hobbes had an enormous impact on subsequent British political, social and economic theory.   Bentham's utilitarianism has elements of Hobbesian hedonism.  Naturally, his idea of a social equilibrium between contradictory self-interests is strikingly obvious in the various aspects of Adam Smith (although Smith was less willing to grant the hedonistic motivation bit) and the rest of economics to the modern day. The last part about the endogenous emergence and evolution of morals and social norms was pinched by both Hume and Hayek. The counterpoint to Hobbes was John Locke and the more optimistic French tradition, particularly Jean-Jacques Rousseau and his English alter-ego, William Godwin.

John A. Hobson, 1858-1940.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hobson.htm," English historicist economist, underconsumption theorist and apostle of the ""New Liberal"" movement. The son of a Liberal newspaper publisher in Derby, John A. Hobson was educated in the classics at Lincoln College, Oxford.  After graduating, he became a schoolteacher and a journalist. After moving to London in 1887, Hobson came into the circle of the Fabian socialists in London.  Although he contributed a couple of volumes (e.g. 1891, 1896) to the Fabians, he was too unenthused by Marxian theory and socialist schemes to remain a subscribing member.    John A. Hobson, like his friend L.T. Hobhouse, was part of the ""New Liberal"" generation that recognized the deficiencies of laissez faire in addressing social problems.  At root, Hobson was still a liberal, to the end still a believer in free markets, a solid defender of free trade and highly suspicious of governments, but recognized that markets could not solve problems like poverty, education, and, most pertinently, general overproduction.  Hobson was thus a strange concoction, a market liberal associated to socialist schools, who managed to be simultaneously fond of both Richard Cobden and John Ruskin.  Hobson articulated an ""organic"" view of society, which saw free and realized individuals as essential to a healthy social organism.  In his memoirs, Hobson recalls reading Herbert Spencer's works in his youth as being the formative influence on his outlook. Hobson was an accomplished author, journalist, historian, economist and critic of the materialist methodology of both Classical and Neoclassical economics.  In some ways, he is the closest thing to the American iconoclast Thorstein Veblen that the British Isles produced (Hobson would later write a panegyric volume on Veblen).  Professionally speaking, however, Hobson was ostracized.  Hounded by the Classical and then the Marshallian orthodoxy, Hobson never attained an academic post, living perennially on the margins of journalism and extension lecturing, and was basically barred from the Political Economy Club and ceaselessly ridiculed in that bastion of Marshallian thought, the Economic Journal.  Reputedly, the editor F.Y. Edgeworth regarded Hobson's works as on the same level as flat earth babble. Hobson's fame today rests n his development of a theory of underconsumption (1889, with the businessman and mountaineer A.F. Mummery). Hobson rejected Say's Law - to an extent; he recognized that savings translated into investment, but investment spending itself contributed to future overproduction, so that capitalism would be gripped by chronic overproduction.   Hobson was one of the first economists since Malthus to articulate and defend an undercomponsumption theory of the trade cycle. John Maynard Keynes would later acknowledge Hobson as a precursor.  Hobson expanded upon this in his 1909 treatise on the Industrial System, probably his best economic treatise, where Hobson advocated practical schemes like redistributive taxation, welfare spending and nationalization of industry to deal with the problem.  Hobson's tract was reputedly influential upon Lloyd George's ""people's budget"" of 1909 - or certainly helped sell it.   His principal economic ideas were distilled in his slimmer Science of Wealth (1911). Other significant economic contributions include Hobson's famous 1891 critique of the Classical theory of rent in the QJE.  His proposed generalization anticipated the Neoclassical ""Marginal Productivity"" theory of distribution by a couple of years. However, Hobson later (1909) disputed the ""product exhaustion"" thesis of that theory, a criticism which several contemporaries (such as Marshall) answered with difficulty.  Hobson's work on social welfare (e.g. 1901) was slightly better received in his day.  Hobson's stock has since risen, not only for the afore-mentioned contributions, but also for his ""evolutionist"" outlook on economy and society, from its early statements (e.g. 1894) to its later elaborations (esp. his 1914  Work and Wealth 1914 and its 1929 ""update""). Hobson also extended his underconsumption thesis to his theory of imperialism.  . Hobson had worked as a journalist in South Africa for the Manchester Guardian on the eve of the Boer War, and upon his return published several a series of articles and books on imperialism and militarism.  Imperialism (1902) is perhaps his most famous book.  Its economic thesis on capitalism's search for new markets for overproduction (anticipating Rosa Luxemburg and Vladimir Lenin) is only part of it.  The bulk of it deals with the politics of it - in particular, to tackle the apparent anomaly that any produced surpluses can be easier gotten rid of by free trade than by the expense of imperialism.  Hobson concludes the impetus comes not from business as a whole, but more narrowly from the financial sector, from the managers of the oversaved fortunes.  They're not looking for markets for goods, but for outlets for speculative investment overseas, and that is facilitated by extending the political jurisdiction on the ground.  It is the financiers, Hobson accuses, by direct control of the press and indirect control of government, that whip up nations into jingoism and imperialist adventures.  Hobson opposed World War I, but also opposed the post-war settlement, and was critical of both the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations.  Like many of the New Liberal generation, Hobson eventually abandoned the Liberals (over their abandonment of free trade principles), and, holding his nose, joined the Labour Party in 1919. After this period, that Hobson's reputation had a lift. Although his general underconsumptionist thesis remained unchanged, his audience has had changed their opinions in the post-war years and his works were reviewed more favorably than before. John A. Hobson lived long enough to see the advent of the Keynesian Revolution, and wrote his memoirs (1938) with some satisfaction in vindication.      Major Works of John A. Hobson   Resources on John A.

Thomas Hodgskin, 1787-1869,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hodgskin.htm,"One of its brightest and most eloquent of Ricardian Socialists, who peculiarly doubled as a free trade liberal anarchist and defender of natural rights individualism. Son of a storekeeper on the Chatham shipyards in Kent, Thomas Hodgskin left home at the age of twelve and enlisted in the Royal Navy.  He served during the Napoleonic Wars and retired as a naval officer on half-pay in 1812.  Fresh off the boat, he put out his polemical Essay on Naval Discipline (1813), a blistering attack on the press-gang, conscription and the lash, decrying the brutality and despotism of the navy as inconsistent with a free society and calling for far-reaching reforms in naval structure and operations. Hodgskin subsequently left for the continent and traveled through northern Germany.  He returned around 1818, publishing his travelogue soon after. Around 1820, Hodgskin read David Ricardo and fell in with the Benthamites for a while, notably James Mill and Francis Place.  It was through their intercession that Hodgskin secured a position as a reporter for the Morning Chronicle in 1822.  He also became involved in education, participating with Place and Birkbeck in founding the London Mechanics Institute in 1823.  Hodgskin would remain associated with the institute and lecture there for the next decade.  Hodgskin covered the parliamentary debate on the combination laws in 1824-25.  The state of the debate on the parliamentary floor prompted Hodgskin to publish his famous pamphlet,  Labour Defended, anonymously in 1825.  Here he took the Ricardian labor theory of value to its exploitation logic, arguing that labor was not only underpaid, but by being the source of capital itself, labor was also the best guarantor of private property and the prosperity of Britain.   His 1829 Natural and Artificial Rights of Property were originally published as newspaper letters Henry Brougham. His 1828 textbook, derived from his lectures at LMI, was perhaps the best English-language textbook in socialist economics at the time - even though he later became involved with the The Economist      Major Works of Thomas Hodgskin   Resources on Thomas Hodgskin   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Francis Horner, 1778-1817.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/horner.htm," Scottish journalist, liberal reformer and Whig statesman.  Francis Horner was born in Edinburgh, the son of linen-manufacturer.   After being educated at the city's High School, Francis Horner enrolled in 1792 at the University of Edinburgh under Dugald Stewart, in the waning years of the Scottish Enlightenment.  In 1797, Horner joined the ""Speculative Society"", a student association in Edinburgh formed back in 1764, that would carry on the spirit of the Scottish Enlightenment and transmit it nationally.  Initially set upon a legal career in Scotland, Francis Horner joined the Scottish Society of Advocates in 1800.  But finding Scottish courts stuffy, Horner decided to pursue a legal career in England, and enrolled at Lincoln's Inn in April 1802 and finally moved the London in July 1803 to study for the bar.  While still in Edinburgh, Horner, together with like-minded youngsters of society days Sidney Smith, Francis Jeffrey,  and Henry Brougham, founded The Edinburgh Review in 1802.  Staunchly liberal, ardently reformist, more Whig than the Whigs, the Edinburgh Review would be instrumental in the advance and popularization laissez-faire doctrine and Classical economics in the first half of the century. Horner contributed many of the economics articles to the early editions of the Edinburgh Review.  Horner was responsible for a brave and insightful review of Henry Thornton's Inquiry in the very first issue (Oct 1802). He went on to review Lord Peter King's tract, setting early phases of the Bullionist debate on track.  Horner was probably the person most responsible for giving the Review its economics-orientation, although Horner would later leave the bulk of the economics field largely to Brougham.  The success of his old society comrade Henry Petty FitzMaurice (Marquess of Lansdowne) in the new ""all-talents"" government of Grenville's Whigs in 1806 lured him to try his hand at politics.  With the help of the Whig patronage machine, Francis Horner was elected to Parliament in November1806. (Horner passed the English bar only in 1807, when already an MP).  Motivated by David Ricardo's articles in the Morning Chronicle, Francis Horner pushed the motion for the resumption of specie payment in parliament.  Horner chaired Bullion Committee formed in February 1810, which included luminaries such as  Thornton, Parnell, Baring and Huskisson, and the prime minister Spencer Perceval himself.  Horner was the primary author of its famous Bullion Report delivered in June 1810, recommending the resumption of convertibility within two years.  Submitted too late in the parliamentary session to be acted upon, debate was postponed until 1811.  In the interval, the Bullionist debate raged with a myriad of articles and pamphlets attacking and defending the report.  In May 1811, Horner finally submitted Bullion Resumption Bill, consisting of fourteen resolutions suggested by the report.  Horner valiantly defended the report from the withering criticism of opponents like Sir George Rose and Nicholas Vanisttart, but to no avail. Horner's resolutions were defeated. Horner joined forces with Rose to defeat the first attempt to introduce the Corn Laws in 1814, but was unable to prevent it from passing in 1815. Sickly through his life, Horner suffered from a chronic pulmonary disease.  Traveling to Italy at the recommendation of his doctor, Horner finally succumbed and died in Livorno, Italy on February 8, 1817, at the age of thirty-eight. Francis Horner's brother, Leonard Horner, was one of the founders of the Edinburgh School of Arts in 1821 which set the Mechanics Institutes movement in motion.

Philip Wilhelm von Hornick, 1638-1712.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hornick.htm," Austrian Cameralist, Philip Wilhelm von Hornick (or Hörnigk or Horneck) studied law at Ingolstadt, receiving his degree in 1661 and setting himself up as a lawyer and civil servant in Vienna.  He was the brother in law of the influential Cameralist theorist, J.J. Becher. A German nationalist,  Hornick was roused to indignation by Louis XIV of France's ""chambers of reunions"" policy, aggressively laying claims to German border territories.  Hornick's first pamphlet (1682) argued for the consolidation of the German states to raise a single army to resist the French encroachments. In 1684, Hornick published his principle Cameralist work, Austria above all, where he famously articulated his 'nine principal rules' of national economy, roughly: (1) utilize all the soil of a country;
(2) utilize raw materials to build up manufacturing within a country;
(3) encourage a large population
(4) prohibit the export of gold and silver;
(5) discourage importation of foreign consumer goods;
(6) that if you must import, match that with exports rather than cash.
(7) import only raw materials to be finished at home.
(8) try to export as much as possible, in return for gold and silver.
(9) prohibit importation of any good available domestically. Hornick's nine principles serve as a neat summary of the 17th C. Mercantilism.  Hornick's pamphlet gained wide circulation and was reprinted numerous times. Hornick served on occasional embassies, and, from 1690, was appointed Privy Counselor to the Prince-Bishop of Passau.

Henry of Susa (Hostiensis), c.1190-1271,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hostiensis.htm,"Henry of Susa (or Henricus Segusio or Hostiensis) was Italian Scholastic canonist. A native of Susa (""Segusio"") in Piedmont,  Henry of Susa studied Roman and Ecclesiastical law at the university of Bologna.  He went on to lecture on canon law at Paris.    Despite his reputation as a great canonist, Henry moved out of his academic career and took up some plum positions in the Church hierarchy.  In 1244, he became Bishop of Sisteron, in 1250 Archbishop of Embrun, and in 1261 became Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia, a suburbarican diocese of Rome, one of the highest positions in the church hierarchy (from whence his nickname (H)Ostiensis). Henry of Susa was still in Paris when he began his most famous work, the Summa aurea, an exposition of the Decretals (papal and councilar decisions, the last eight years of which had recently appeared in 1234 under the editorship of Raymond of Peñafort).  Henry completed his Summa in 1253, when he was already in Embrun (a fire had destroyed the first original draft).  It was written as a manual for practitioners, incorporating the latest court practice, both Roman and Ecclesiastical, to bear on canon law.  It become a popular text in the study of canon law for several centuries.  Henry's more original work was probably his Lectura (or Commentaria) on the Decretals, which he finished in the early 1260s. In his discussion on usury,  Henry of Susa considered several cases of  ""exceptions"" to the general ban on usury or increase on capital lent.  Twelve exceptions are given in a easily memorized verse form: feuda, fidejussor, pro dote, stipendia cleri,
Venditio fructus, cui velle jure noceri
Vendens sub dubio, pretium post tepora solvens,
Poena nec in fraudem, lex commissaria, gratis
Dans, socii pompa: plus forte modis datur istis (Summa aurea: Lib. 5,  ch. 19, sec. 7 1448-49) The list of exceptions include various modes of temporary transfer of property, with the fruits of the property, the effective interest, being acceptable interest.  Under this title come ""feuda"" (return of a fief to the church as security), ""pro dote"" (property given to a bridegroom as security on unpaid dowry), ""stipendia cleri"" (revenue from pedges placed with clerics in view to recovering ecclesiastical benefices), ""venditio fructus"" (land revenues sold in advance, fruits in excess of payment reaped by the buyer, justified in light of uncertainty) and ""lex commissoria"" (clause allowing a seller to regain possession of property by refunding original price, fruits accruing to the buyer).  Also included under the exceptions are interest as compensation for damage, which includes  ""fidejussor"" (compensation to those who put up security for clerics in debt to merchants), ""pretium post tempora solvens"" (late payment charge to cover possible damages), ""poena nec in fraudum"" (penalty charge for not executing contract) Other exceptions include selling at higher price now in anticipation of higher value acquired later (""vendens sub dubio""), gifts by the debtor (""gratia dans""), property leased for purposes of display (""socii pompa""),  and charging usury to heretics and infidels (""cui velle jure noceri"").  A thirteenth exception compensation for labor) is added in the text. In his Lectura, Henry goes beyond these well-known cases and is the first to introduce the justification of lucrum cessans, that is, the charging of interest on a loan from the outset, on  the basis of foregone profit by the lender, provided that loan was made with charitable intent:. Ideo puto ex mente praemissorum iurium, quod si aliquis sit mercator , qui conseueuit sequi mercata et nundianas, et ibi multa lucrari, mihi multum indigenti, ex charitate mutuaret pecuniam, cum qua negotiaturus erat, quod ego exinde sibi ad suum in eo quo notatur supra eo. Tuas in fin. Et dummondo dictus mercator non consueuerit pecuniam suam taliter tradere at vsuram.""  (Commentario Lib. 5.19.16. n.4) ""if some merchant, who is accustomed to pursue trade and the commerce of the fairs and there profit much, has, out of charity to me, who needs it badly, lent money with which he would have done business, I remain obliged from this to his interesse, provided that nothing is done in fraud of usury ... and provided that said merchant will not have been accustomed to give his money in such a way to usury"". Henry of Susa's lucrum cessans argument would be rejected by Thomas Aquinas, but accepted by Duns Scotus      Major Works of Hostiensis Resources on Hostiensis All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Harold Hotelling, 1895-1973.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hotelling.htm," Harold Hotelling's articles on econoimcs were few, but his contributions were profound enough to make him one of the ""leaders"" of the Paretian revival, the ""resurrectors"" the Marginalist Revolution in the 1930s. Born in Minnesota, and raised in Seattle, Harold Hotelling studied journalism at the University of Washington, before going on to take a master's in mathematics.  He obtained his  Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton in 1924, and obtained his first appointment at Stanford in 1924.  Hotelling's first ventures into economics and statistics started almost immediately. Harold Hotelling was appointed as a professor of economics at Columbia  in 1931 (then a stronghold of the American Institutionalist school) to replace Henry L. Moore. Hotelling's 1929 paper on the stability of competition introduced the notion of spatial competition in a duopoly situation. The solution to this problem was in fact an early statement of a very well-known game-theoretic solution concept: the subgame-perfect equilibrium (as later defined by Selten.).   His 1929 paper on depreciation provided its modern definition as the decline in discounted future values.   In 1931, he advanced another technique into economics, the calculus of variations, into a now famous analysis of resource exhaustion.    Hotelling's 1932 piece reworked the theory of production into a choice-theoretic framework based on profit-maximization, setting the foundations of the modern Neoclassical approach.  His 1935 derivation of demand was actually simultaneous with that of Hicks and Allen.   His famous 1938 presidential address to the Econometric Society introduced the ""marginal cost pricing"" equilibrium as a general welfare proposition: roughly, that economic efficiency is achieved if every good is produced and priced at marginal cost.  This would be the foundation of the Fundamental Welfare Theorems of Paretian general equilibrium theory.  It was also here that he introduced his famous ""two-part"" tariff as an alternative solution in situations of natural monopoly. One can argue that Harold Hotelling was a statistician first, economist second.  He spent the second half of 1929 working under R.A. Fisher in England. Hotelling's work in mathematical statistics included his famous 1931 paper on the Student's t distribution for hypothesis testing, in which he laid out what has since been called ""confidence intervals"".  At Columbia, he ensured that the economics students under him were well immersed in statistical theory.  He trained both Kenneth Arrow and Milton Friedman, and was instrumental in the appointment of Abraham Wald. Hotelling left Columbia in 1946, and became professor of economics and statistics at the University of North Carolina.

David Hume, 1711-1776.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hume.htm,"  Scottish philosopher, historian and economist, sociologist. David Hume was one of the greatest philosophers in Western history, as well as an accomplished historian and economist.  Although the perennial skeptic, David Hume was, by all accounts, a rather good-natured fellow too. Despite lacking an academic perch, David Hume was arguably the most prominent figure of the Scottish Enlightenment (roughly dated 1740 to 1790) and a close friend of Adam Smith.  Hume's contributions to economics are found mostly in his Political Discourses (1752), which were incorporated in 1758 as part of his Essays Moral, Literary and Political.    In his memoir of David Hume, Adam Smith would write:  ""I have always considered him, both in lifetime and since his death, as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man, as perhaps the nature of human frailty will admit"" (Smith, 1776)Hume was certainly gifted - indeed, most of his ideas had been worked out by the time he was nineteen - but what Fortune bestows with one hand, it often takes away with the other. Born on April 26, 1711 in Edinburgh, Scotland, the second son of the lawyer Joseph Home and Katherine Falconer of Ninewells (an estate near Berwick-upon- Tweed). His father, a lawyer, died in 1713 and his mother raised him singlehandedly (Hume changed his name from ""Home"" to ""Hume""  in 1731, when he perceived Englishmen having complications with the pronunciation of the Scottish ""Home""). Hume enrolled at the university of Edinburgh in 1723 to study law (enrolling at twelve was not too astonishing in that century). In 1727, Hume met his distant relative Henry Home (future Lord Kames) who would become a life-long friend and mentor. However, philosophy and literature called and Hume withdrew from the university in 1729 and dedicated the next eight, long years, marred by illness, depression, frustration and mental breakdown, to the solitary study of that discipline and the construction of his formidable thesis - eventually laid out in his masterpiece A Treatise of Human Nature. Hume's project was complex enough: as the subtitle of his Treatise indicates, he sought to ""introduce the experimental method of reasoning into moral subjects"" - or, more simply, to introduce the scientific methods of the Enlightenment, of Newton and Bacon, to bear on five human subjects. These subjects were to be laid out in five volumes - I (Of the Understanding), II (Of the Passions), III (Of Morals), IV (Of Politics) and V (Of Criticism).  In 1734, seeking respite and restoration (and a bit of money), David Hume went to Bristol, England, to learn the art of commerce.  He found work for a few months with a sugar merchant, but soon disappeared to France in the summer of 1734, settling down first at Rheims and then at La Flèche (near the celebrated Jesuit College of Anjou which Descartes had attended), where he set about writing the Treatise. Hume returned to London in the Fall of 1737 to finalize and oversee its publication. Of the envisaged five volumes of the Treatise of Human Nature, only the first three were published: in 1739 (Volumes I and II) and 1740 (Volume III). Hume was then twenty-nine years old. In 1739, while the book was being published, he returned to Scotland, staying with family in Ninewells and Edinburgh. According to Hume, the anonymously-published Treatise ""fell deadborn from the press, without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots"" (Hume, 1776). This was not exactly true: the zealots disliked it even although he had, in a fit of fright, pulled out his more contentious parts of his Treatise (such as the notorious essay on ""Miracles"") before publication.  Hume concluded that the tepid, if not hostile, reception to the Treatise was due merely to his mode of presentation as opposed to its content.  He re-worked the presentation of the arguments in the Treatise into more digestible forms  via two ""explanatory"" tracts: an Abstract lately published (1740) and A Letter from a Gentleman (1745), both directed to refuting the charges of the ""zealots"". (However, Hume would not put out another edition of the Treatise in his lifetime - indeed, there would be no reprints of it at all until 1818). Hume had originally envisaged the Treatise as a five-volume work.  The first three, I (Of the Understanding), II (Of the Passions) and III (Of Morals), had appeared in 1739-40. The next two volumes, IV (Of Politics) and V (Of Criticism), never saw the light of day However, much of what he sought to write on these topics ended up in two collections of essays on various topics: Essays Moral and Political (1741-42) to which he later added Three Essays (1748).  These were, incidentally, the first publications to which Hume explicitly attached his name. In February 1744, the chair in moral philosophy at the University of Edinburgh fell vacant with the resignation of John Pringle.  The university offered the chair to Frances Hutcheson (then at Glasgow), but Hutcheson declined.  So David Hume submitted his candidacy.  Appointments to the university were controlled by the Town Council of Edinburgh, which decided to consult several clergymen on Hume's credentials.  Conservative Presbyterian clerics found Hume ""subversive"" and suspiciously irreligious and objected.  William Wishart, the Principal of Edinburgh University, circulated a set of ""dangerous"" propositions found in the Treatise, to which Hume would reply point by point in his A Letter from a Gentleman (Mar 1745, addressed to Kames). But after months of wrangling, Hume's candidacy failed (the position went instead to Pringle's deputy and cleric, William Cleghorn). In the aftermath of his defeat at the Edinburgh chair, in April, 1745, Hume found employment as the private tutor to the Marquis de Annandale.  Hume stayed at the marquis's estate of Weld Hall (near St. Alban's) for a year, but realizing the marquis was half-mad, and his estate manager a crook, Hume managed to eventually extricate himself from that situation.  In May 1746, Hume found new employment as assistant to the restless General James St. Clair. With St. Clair, Hume ended up in Brittany, France as Judge Advocate, the bizarre outcome of a hare-brained military expedition originally intended for Canada.  They returned to London in June, 1747.  The next year, Hume followed St. Clair on embassies to Vienna and Turin in February 1748. Hume returned to Britain by 1749, living in his brother's home in Ninewells, Dundee, for the next two years. Hume had found time for his philosophical labors while under St. Clair, and during this period wrote two formidable enquiries, An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, (published Apr, 1748) and an Enquiry into the Principles of Morals (published Nov, 1751). The first clarified his epistemological theory, originally presented in Vol. I of the Treatise, in a clear and accessible manner (and took this opportunity to incorporate his essay ""Of Miracles"").  The second enquiry did the same for his theory of ethics (which had been Vol. III of the Treatise).  He considered this second work ""incomparably the best"" of all the works he had written. The Treatise (1739-40) and the both of the Enquiry (1748 & 1751) exposited Hume's basic outlook and his main contributions to the Scottish Enlightenment.  He section on morals disputed Hutcheson's theory of morals, which posited that man was endowed with an ""innate moral sense"" The publication of Hume's essay ""Of Miracles"" in his 1748 Enquiry touched off a firestorm.  Hume posited that ancient miracles reported in the Holy Bible were as incredulous as miracles more recently reported by superstitious Catholic populations in Europe  At first it went largely unnoticed, but his old mentor Henry Home (Lord Kames) had been roused to write his own Essays on Morality in early 1751 disputing some points in Hume's theses on morals, religion and philosophy, that ended up giving Hume's works further publicity.   Conservative Presbyterian ministers were particularly incensed by the essay on miracles, and a flurry of articles and pamphlets began to appear in the Spring of 1751 attacking both Hume and  ""Sopho"" (Kames's pseudonym). In the summer of 1751, Hume left England and finally moved permanently to Edinburgh.  At this time, Hume made another attempt at a university post - this time for the chair in moral philosophy at the University of Glasgow, which was coming vacant in November 1751 with the sudden fatal illness of John Craigie (Hutcheson's successor since 1746).   But this was at the height of the miracles controversy, so a confluence of clerical and conservative forces roused to thwart him again.   The publication of Hume's Enquiry on Morals in November 1751 did little to calm fears (although wisely Hume refrained from publishing his Dialogues on Natural Religion, which he had largely completed by this time).  Hume's good friend Adam Smith (then professor of logic at Glasgow) failed to support his candidacy, apparently out of timidity (""I should prefer David Hume to any man for a colleague; but I am afraid the public would not be of my opinion; and the interest of the society will oblige us to have some regard to the opinion of the public"", Smith's letter to Cullen, Nov 1751). The  chair would ultimately be offered to Smith himself - or more precisely, Smith was transferred from logic to moral philosophy in early 1752, and Hume's bid was re-oriented to succeeding Smith in the vacated logic chair.  But it failed regardless (the logic chair ended up going to John Clow). As consolation, in January, 1752, David Hume secured a position as librarian to the College of Advocates in Edinburgh. Although its emolument was relatively modest (£40 a year), the Library of Advocates was one of the larger libraries in Britain, boasting over thirty thousand volumes, and a gathering point for researchers and scholars of the Scottish Enlightenment.  That same year, Hume put another volume of essays, Political Discourses (Feb, 1752) which contain most of his contributions to economics.  The three collections of essays were eventually placed together in a single volume,  Essays: Moral, Political and Literary in 1758.  As it turns out, this was perhaps his best-received work.  Hume's conjectures on population were disputed by Robert Wallace in 1753. As a librarian, Hume had much time and resources around him, so he set about writing his monumental six-volume History of England (1754-1762), initially published in reverse chronological order. This work was not a new and independent interest of Hume's - rather, he saw it as a continuation of his other work, a ""practical application"" of his theses on politics. The Essays and the History of England restored much of the reputation he had lost with the Treatise and its aftermath. The controversy on miracles continued in the meantime, and conservative ministers launched an attempt to get both Hume and ""Sopho"" proscribed and excommunicated by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Kirk of Scotland in 1755.  But Kames and Hume had sufficient allies among the ""Moderate"" faction of the Kirk (led by William Robertson and other friends from the ""Select Society"") and the attempt failed by 1756. But perhaps Hume got too cocky. In  February 1757, Hume published his Four Dissertations, which included the famous essay on ""the Natural History of Religion"", lambasting Deistic ""natural religion"" (i.e. the then-popular idea that religion can be based on reason and not revelation), arguing instead that religious belief was very much a child of vulgar ""superstition and enthusiasm"". Hume was toying with fire now.  He pressed on nonetheless, completing his highly atheistic Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion and two essays, ""Of Suicide"" and ""Of the Immortality of the Soul"".  But sensing the trouble he was getting into, he suppressed these from publication. Nonetheless, he was pressured to resign his position in the Edinburgh library in 1757. In October, 1763, Hume left the world of books and returned to the world of men, accompanying the British ambassador to France, Lord Hertford, as personal secretary. Hume's reputation preceded him and he was the toast of Enlightenment France.  Hume stayed two and a half years in Paris, in connection with the British embassy, even serving as charge d'affaires for several months in 1765.  In January, 1766, Hume returned to London  bringing along with him the much-persecuted Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Rousseau benefited tremendously from Hume's hospitality and protection in England, writing his famous Letters from the Mountain against his critics from Hume's home. But Rousseau's paranoia and bitterness eventually tried even the eternal patience of the good-natured Hume. When they broke in 1767, Hume felt compelled by the swirling rumor-mills to write a tract explaining exactly the cause of his quarrel with Rousseau.   In February 1767, Hume was appointed Under-Secretary of State for the Northern Department (proto-foreign office), which he holds until 1768.  In 1769, rewarded with a state pension, Hume left London for Edinburgh where he would remain until his death. There he lived in philosophical semi-retirement, correcting his earlier works, entertaining his fellow intellectuals of the Scottish Enlightenment and Mrs. Anne Ord. Hume fell ill in 1775.  After a brief sojourn for a cure in Bath, Hume knew the end was coming, and wrote a short autobiographical notice, My Own Life in 1776, wherein he acknowledged, for the first time, his authorship of the Treatise. Despite a rather prolonged, painful illness, David Hume died on April 26, 1776, at the age of sixty-five, a happy, confirmed atheist until the end (for an account of Hume's last days, see Adam Smith's Letter to Strahan and James Boswell's Journal).  Before his death, Hume instructed Adam Smith to arrange for the publication of his long- suppressed two essays, ""Of Suicide"" and ""Of the Immortality of the Soul"" and his Dialogues concerning Natural Religion. The ever-timid Smith refused to go through with it and so did his publisher William Strahan. Finally, his nephew published them  in 1777,  the Two Essays and the Dialogues appearing without the author's name nor even the publisher's. In his economic contributions, David Hume was an avowed liberal and a virulent anti-Mercantilist.  He was adamant that wealth was measured by the stock of commodities of a nation, not its stock of money.  He was also one of the better articulators of the Quantity Theory and the neutrality of money (""It is none of the wheels of trade: it is the oil which renders the motion of the wheels more smooth and easy"", Of Money, 1752).  Contrary to the Mercantilists, Hume related low interest rates not to abundant money, but to booming commerce.  He was one of the first to spell out the ""loanable funds"" theory of interest, arguing that interest rates are determined by the demand for loans and the supply of saving.  Low interest rates are thus symptoms of a booming, commercial economy, where thrift and the desire for gain and accumulation take hold.  However, Hume admitted that in the short-run (and only the short-run), a rising supply of money could have a beneficial effect on industry. Hume's most famous contributions are in international trade.  Contrary to the Mercantilists, he did not conceive of foreign trade as a zero-sum game but argued that there are mutual gains from trade.  Hume argued that the total volume of international trade is directly related to the diversity and wealth of all nations.  As he concludes, ""I shall therefore venture to acknowledge that not only as a man, but as a British subject I pray for the flourishing commerce of Germany, Spain, Italy and even France itself."" (Of the Jealousy of Trade, 1758).    Hume also introduced the automatic ""price-specie flow"" mechanism and the ""reflux principle"".  Its basic argument was to deny the old Mercantilist policy proposition that the inflow of gold specie into a nation could be accomplished by manipulating the external trade balance.  Hume argued that the inflow of specie would, by his Quantity Theory, lead to a rise in domestic prices, thereby changing the terms of trade against the recipient nation.  The demand for its exports abroad would consequently decline, and its own demand for foreign imports would increase, thereby reversing the external trade balance so that specie now would flow back out.  Hume also used this logic to deny the idea that rises in prices can be blamed on rising wages. Specifically, if there was a wage-induced rise in the price level in England, the terms of trade between England and other nations would change in a manner detrimental to English exports and favorable to the imports from other nations.  This would thereby induce an outflow of money from England , and thus a reduction in England's money stock which would bring the price level in England back down.  Hume's automatic flow mechanism of international trade lent credence to the idea that there was a ""natural balance"" of trade between nations which deliberate policy moves could not contradict. But Hume was not a believer of the ""natural law"" or ""social contract"" theories popular with contemporary political and social philosophers.  He was a thorough empiricist in both his political and philosophical work.  His hedonistic theory of morals served as a foundation of utilitarianism.  His theories of ""evolution"" of ethics, institutions and social conventions and were highly influential upon the Hayek and later evolutionary theories.  Hume's essay on miracle would provoke William Paley's 1794 Views of the Evidences.

William Huskisson, 1770-1830.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/huskisson.htm,"  British financier and statesman, sometime economist, a fellow-traveler of the Classical Ricardians..  Born the son of a well-connected physician, William Huskisson spent a good part of his teenage years in Paris in the 1780s, where his father served the British Ambassador and witnessed the French Revolution first-hand.  Huskisson's interest in finance was sparked by the chaos surrounding the revolutionary assignats.  After returning to Britain in 1792, his impressions of France sought, Huskisson fell into the political circle of Pitt the Younger, and shared similar liberal laissez-faire instincts..  In 1796, Huskisson successfully stood for parliament, where he would remain for much of the rest of his life, switching seats every once in a while.  In 1804, Pitt appointed Huskisson Secretary of the Treasury.  After Pitt's death in 1806, his growing reputation as an expert in finance allowed him to return as Secretary in the 1807 coalition government of the Duke of Portland, although he would resign along with the rest of his faction of liberal Tories (now led by George Canning) in 1809.  For much of the next decade, Huskisson would be one of the principle opponents of the Liverpool government. In 1809, Huskisson jumped into the  Bullionist controversy, publishing a pamphlet backing Ricardo's call for the restoration of specie convertibility.  Huskisson was one of the more active figures on the famous Bullion Committee of 1810-11 and again in the Peel Committee of 1819. A liberal, Huskisson was a guiding force behind the relaxation of the Corn Laws in 1821 and the resumption of specie act. The economic crisis and repression of the turn of the 1820s had turned the old Tory government of  Robert Jenkinson (Lord Liverpool) quite unpopular.  In order to shake things up, Liverpool invited four members of the liberal Tories faction (George Canning, Robert Peel,  Frederick Robinson and Huskisson) to join his government.   Huskisson was appointed president of the Board of Trade in 1823, and immediately set about instituting many of the liberal reforms he had previously urged from the floor. Huskisson relaxed the Navigation Acts (allowing the principle of reciprocity to govern colonial trade), simplified and cut as many extraneous tariffs as he could, helped the new chancellor, Frederick J. Robinson, put an end to the miserable Sinking Fund, and, in his most famous act, lifted the laws restricting the movement of labor and organized the repeal of the Combination Acts in 1824, allowing workers at long last to unionize. The sharp financial Crisis of 1825 - in part brought about by the speculative excesses of the ""prosperous"" new ministry - renewed labor unrest and forced the restoration of some restrictions on union activity.  The crisis settled, Huskisson turned his guns on the hated Corn Laws.  He was in the process of pushing a weakening amendment when Liverpool suddenly got a stroke and was forced to retire.  Liberal George Canning took over as PM, but the old Tories (now led by Wellington) would not serve under him, particularly when Canning felt bold enough to demand Catholic emancipation and Parliamentary reform.. Although, at Huskisson's push, the Corn Laws were reformed in 1827-28, with a sliding scale of import duties rather than outright prohibition, all other business of government ground to a halt in the acrimony.  When Canning himself died later that year, the mantle of leadership of the liberal Tory faction fell upon Huskisson (albeit with Robinson as figurehead PM),  but there was hardly any liberal Tories left - the more liberal ones had defected to the Whigs, the more Tory ones to Wellington.  The Robinson government collapsed in January 1928, and the Duke of Wellington formed a conservative Tory government.  Huskisson stayed on for a few months, but resigned by May, soon followed by other liberal Tories. That same year, 1828, William Huskisson tried to endow a chair in political economy at Cambridge University (on much the same terms as Drummond had endowed his at Oxford), on the condition that someone other than George Pryme (long-time lecturer at Cambridge since 1816) take the chair.  But Cambridge refused. Huskisson's death made history as the world's first fatal railway casualty.  On September 15, 1830, Huskisson was among the dignitaries invited to the opening of the Liverpool & Manchester Railway, the first proper railroad dedicated to steam locomotives.  Having dallied on the rails during a stop, Huskisson was run over and killed by the train.  News of Huskisson's death, written up in newspapers everywhere, actually helped popularize news about the L&MR, and the novelty of the no-horse railway.

Francis Hutcheson, 1694-1746.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hutcheson.htm,"  Francis Hutcheson was a professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow, arguably the father of the Scottish Enlightenment and an early utilitarian thinker.  Francis (or Frances) Hutcheson was born in Armagh, northern Ireland, to a family of Scottish Presbyterian ministers.  In 1710, Hutcheson went to study at the University of Glasgow, receiving his degree in 1712 and obtaining his license to preach in 1716. However, there were widespread suspicions about about his ""Irish"" roots and his association with Glasgow theologian John Simson (then under investigation by Scottish ecclesiastical courts).  Hutcheson realized  that any ministry he held in Scotland would not likely be a success, so he decided to return to Northern Ireland.  About to settle into a small ministry, Hutcheson was induced to try his luck in a new dissenting academy in Dublin.  Hutcheson taught for several years there, studying philosophy on the side and marrying into a landed Williamite family.  Roused to indignation by Mandeville's Fable on private vices and public benefits, in 1725, Hutcheson produced his famous Inquiry on our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue.  In it, Hutcheson opposed Thomas Hobbes's old thesis that human conceptions of ""right"" and ""wrong"", ""virtue"" and ""vice"", were rooted not in any theological or natural conceptions but purely in selfish hedonic pleasure and pain calculations.  Hutcheson accepted that virtue is associated with pleasure and vice with pain, but tried to avoid Hobbes's conclusion that it all boils down to self-interest.  Instead, like Shaftesbury before him, Hutcheson argued that humans have natural and disinterested feelings of benevolence which guide their moral acts and an innate ""moral sense"" which informs their moral judgments.  Inverting Hobbes's thesis, Hutcheson argued that virtue/vice comes first, pleasure/pain afterwards.  We experience pleasurable sensations in doing or observing ""virtuous"" things because anything which complies with our natural benevolence or moral sense automatically yields pleasure.   As benevolence involves giving pleasure to others, Hutcheson reaches the famous utilitarian ""greatest happiness"" formula as a natural moral commandment: ""In comparing the moral Qualitys of Actions, in order to regulate our Election among various Actions propos'd, or to find which of them has the greatest moral Excellency, we are led by our moral Sense of Virtue to judge thus; that in equal Degrees of Happiness, expected to proceed from the Action, the Virtue is in proportion to the Number of Persons to whom the Happiness shall extend; ... so that, that Action is best, which procures the greatest Happiness for the greatest numbers; and that, worst, which, in like manner, occasions Misery."" (Hutcheson, 1725: Sect. 3.8) Hutcheson's theory of aesthetics was set along similar lines to his ethics, e.g.  beauty was not a property of the object but arises from an innate ""aesthetic sense"", and drew parallels for comparison.  In a series of articles in James Arbunckle's Dublin journal, Hibernicus's Letters in 1725 and 1726.  Hutcheson assaulted Hobbes's theory of ""laughter"" (which Hobbes asserted to be induced by selfish feelings of superiority to objects of derision) and Mandeville's disturbing Fable directly.  This was quickly followed by a duel with Gilbert Burnet ('Philaretus') in the London Journal, which prompted his second great treatise, Essay on the Passions and Affections (1728). As his fame spread, Hutcheson was invited back to Scotland to take a Chair of Moral Philosophy at the University of Glasgow in 1729, succeeding Gershom Carmichael, his old professor.   Hutcheson would remain there until his death in 1746.  Hutcheson made Glasgow one of the principal seats of activity during the Scottish Enlightenment, counting Adam Smith and Thomas Reid among his students.  He was one of the first academics to lecture in English rather than Latin.   Hutcheson's later works are based on the Moral Philosophy course he taught at Glasgow - a Latin summary of the ethics section Philosphia Moralis (1742), and a more extensive System of Moral Philosophy (published posthumously in 1755 but already circulating before).   The System (like the course) was split into four parts: Natural Religion, Ethics, Jurisprudence and Government. Hutcheson's initial lectures on moral philosophy were based on Carmichael's, which drew much from the natural law philosophers Grotius and Pufendorf, but the course eventually evolved distinctly into Hutcheson's own.  In the ethics part, Hutcheson articulated his moral philosophy thesis more explicitly and more directly in opposition to Hobbesian hedonism and Hume's modifications. Adam Smith's TMS tried to reconcile the Hutcheson's ""innateness"" thesis with Hume's hedonistic doctrine. The latter sections of Hutcheson's System include extensive discussion of economic topics.   Hutcheson was not very enthusiastic about the fledgling capitalist system, being highly suspicious of its implications for traditional virtues like benevolence and generosity.  Besides the 'public' moral philosophy course at Glasgow, Hutcheson also taught a 'private' course on ancient theories of ethics and a Sunday evening lecture on evidences of Christianity. Hutcheson was highly influential upon Adam Smith. When Smith took over Hutcheson's old Moral Philosophy chair at Glasgow in 1752, he kept the same four-part structure and initially used Hutcheson's lecture notes-textbook as the basis of his own course.

Terence W. Hutchison, 1912-2007,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/twhutchison.htm,"English economist Terence Wilmot Hutchison has arguably been the official curmudgeon of the economics world - irritating everyone from the powerful to the meek. Hutchison's famous 1938 treatise, Significance and Basic Postulates of Economic Theory, was an early attempt at bringing logical positivism into economics - claiming that as long as economics rested on a hypothetical-deductive edifice, it remained a body of empty tautologies. In short, Hutchison called for the formulation of testable empirical hypothesis. It was precisely this tome that prompted F.H. Knight to essay his famous ruminating (and fiercely critical) response, ""`What is Truth' in Economics"" (1940) (which might explain, at least in part, Hutchison's laudatory treatment of Knight's rival, Jacob Viner). Hutchison entered another famous duel with Fritz Machlup in 1956 when Machlup attempted to reconcile economic practice with logical positivism - a reconciliation Hutchison refused to acknowledge and for which he earned the label of ""Ultra-Empiricist"". Nonetheless, Hutchison has served as one of the most consistent and careful recorders of the history of economic thought and his incisive and often provocative insights in economic methodology have long accompanied the development of the discipline. Time has not yet mellowed him and his repeated fights with the Austrians and Ricardians have not worn away his sharp wit, but his sometimes bitter tone can obscure many valuable contributions.  Educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge,  T.W. Hutchison taught at the University of Birmingham in the UK for most of his career.      Major Works of Terence W. Hutchison   Resources on T.W.

John K. Ingram, 1823-1907.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/ingram.htm," Irish ballad-writer, pedagogue and economist, John K. Ingram was one of the prominent figures of the ""English"" Historical School.  Born in Donegal, Ireland, to an (Episcopalian) Church of Ireland family. John Kells Ingram attended Trinity College Dublin.  Graduating in 1843, Ingram was elected fellow in 1846.  He would remain as a teacher and/or administrator at Trinity for much of the rest of his life.  Ingram had an early brush of celebrity when his youthful 1843 poem, ""The Memory of the Dead"" (referring to the 1798 rebellion), became a popular Irish ballad -- indeed, that is perhaps Ingram's most enduring claim to fame.    The breadth of Ingram's scholarship was interesting -- according to Richard Ely, Ingram was ""probably the most learned man in the world"". Soon after graduating, he was employed by Trinity as a lecturer in oratory (from 1852), English literature (from 1855) and Greek (from 1866).  But he dabbled in economics and statistics as well, being a founder of the Dublin Statistical Society in 1847. Like his comrade-in-arms, Thomas Cliffe-Leslie (who was also at Trinity), Ingram was seduced by the sociological vision of Auguste Comte and suspicious of the claims of the Ricardian School.  In his celebrated 1878 address to Section F of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS), Ingram went on the offensive, dismissing the Classical School and the deductive method of economic reasoning as incomplete and speculative, advocating the Historicist  approach as much more ""scientific"".  He deplored the materialism, ideology, abstractionism and scientism of Classical theory, arguing instead for a institutional and historical treatment of economics under the Comtian umbrella of ""sociology"". In 1879, Ingram was appointed Librarian at Trinity College Dublin.  In 1886, he took up the more leisurely post of Senior Lecturer.  It was around this time that he wrote his numerous entries into the Encyclopedia Britannica on the more famous economists, including a thumbnail sketch of the history of economic thought (1885).  This latter entry Ingram expanded and transformed into a separate book, History of Political Economy (1888).  It employs the ""historicist"" method to intellectual history, grounding the evolution of economic thought in the actual economic, political and social conditions of the time.  It helped knock the Ricardians down a peg or two, and catapulted Ingram into international renown.   Ingram's address and treatise was celebrated by the Historicists in America and Germany.  But Ingram was, in many ways, less interested in furthering the Historicist research program as it existed then and more interested in harnessing it to the Comtian vision and impressing it with a duty for social melioration.  Ingram, after all, was also a scholar of religion and morals.      Major Works of John K. Ingram   Resources on John Ingram   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Irnerius of Bologna, c.1050-c.1130.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/irnerius.htm," Medieval Italian jurist, nicknamed the ""lamp of the law"" (lucerna juris), Irnerius helped recover Roman law in the late 11th Century.  Irnerius is widely regarded as founder of the University of Bologna  and the father of modern Civil Law.   Up until Irnerius, the Medieval understanding of law depended primarily on the whim of the feudal lord, weakly backed up by a hodge-podge of  legal traditions - customary, ordeal, Germanic, Roman, Ecclesiastical - much of it from faint memory, with only scraps and no substantive texts.  Around 1070, a nearly-intact copy of Justinian's Institutes was discovered in Bologna.  The Institutes was one of four books of the Corpus Juris Civilis,  the compendium of Roman law assembled on order of Emperor Justinian in the 530s, but which had been lost since the Lombard conquest in the late 6th C.  The other three parts of the Justinian Corpus were soon recovered - the Codex and Novellae (compilation of old and new imperial laws, which may have been known to exist before) and, most importantly, the Digest (a compilation of decisions by Roman jurists, notably the 3rd C. jurists Papian, Ulpian, Paulus and  Modestinus,  setting out the principles of jurisprudence, a full Greek copy of which was brought to Italy by Burgundio of Pisa).  The Institutes was a commentary on the Digest, explaining these decisions, an elementary textbook for law students in Justinian's time. . The discovery of the Institutes immediately fed into a contemporary Papal-Imperial quarrel.  Countess Mathilda of Tuscany, owner of vast estates across central and northern Italy, had intended to endow her dominions to the Pope.  But the Emperor, who sought those lands for himself, challenged her right to do so, citing vague Germanic custom that curtailed women's rights of inheritance and disposal.  Mathilda dispatched young Irnerius, at the time probably just a clerk attached to her chancellary in Tuscany,  to Bologna to study the books, to find out exactly what rights she did have.  But the Justinian texts contained a swirl of legal terms and concepts, most of them unfamiliar to contemporaries.  Setting himself up at Saint Stefano in Bologna (tentatively dated 1088), Irnerius dedicated himself to systematically deciphering them, and providing their definitions by glossing - i.e. writing notes in the margins.   Irnerius was not the first to comment or teach Roman law in Bologna - that honor belongs slightly earlier to a certain Pepo.   But Irnerius's glossing and exposition of  Roman law books was instrumental in transforming how law was understood and taught.   Irnerius firmly separated law from rhetoric, and articulated it in the manner of the old Roman jurists, as a scientific discipline, related to rigorous principles and high concepts such as Justice, and not merely as a guidebook for practitioners.   Students flocked to Bologna to be taught by Irnerius, forming the nucleus of what would become the Studium Generale or University of Bologna. From Bologna, emanated the first generation of trained professional jurists and administrators in Europe, that would gradually take over the jobs long performed by feudal amateurs.   Irnerius was succeeded by what has been called the Four Doctors of Bologna - Bulgarus, Martinus Gosius, Jacopus de Boragine and Hugh of Porta Ravennate.  The surviving glosses of Irnerius and his successors were compiled by Accursius (Accorso di Bagnolo) in 1230.      Major Works of Irnerius Resources on Irnerius All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Isaak Iselin, 1728-1782,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/iselin.htm," German Swiss Enlightenment philosopher and Physiocrat. Isaak Iselin studied law and philosophy at Basel and Göttingen, and went on to became a secretary of state of the republic of Basel in 1756. An ardent republican, his early efforts were dedicated to Enlightenment political philosophy (1755), largely an effort to extol the republican ideal, revised several times (1760) in light of the works of Montesquieu and Rousseau, and culminating in his 1764 exercise in conjectural history.   Iselin became enchanted with the Physiocrats, reviewing their doctrines in his 1772 Versuch (which contains a detailed description of Quesnay's Tableau).  Iselin went on to compose a  long, roaming treatise (1776), effectively a complete revision of his own philosophy in light of his new Physiocratic embrace. In 1776, Iselin established and edited the monthly journal Ephemeriden der Menschheit, in imitation of the Physiocratic Ephémérides du citoyen, which ran out of Basel until 1778, then relocated to Leipzig in 1780 until Iselin's death in 1782 (it was carried on by W.G. Becker for three more years).      Major Works of Isaak Iselin     Resources on Isaak Iselin   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Isidore of Seville, c.560-636.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/isidore.htm,"  Isidore of Seville was the brother and successor of Leander of Seville, who converted the Visigothic rulers of Spain from Arian to Catholic Christianity in 589.  Isidore became Bishop of Seville in 600 and helped guide the fledgling Spanish Church in the decades of upheaval that followed.  Isidore promoted a hard line on latent Arians, insisting on the insertion of the controversial filioque clause in the Nicene creed to that effect. Isidore also notoriously advocated a hard line against the Jews, which the Visigoths, up to that point, had left relatively unmolested.  Isidore of Seville's principal work is undoubtedly his Etymologies, a massive encyclopedia, attempting to encompass all Classical Greek and Roman knowledge available before the Dark Ages buried it completely. Organized in 'etymological' fashion (by definitions), many of which are quite conjectural and often absurd, it nonetheless open the way to Isidore's summaries of the Classical wisdom, either directly from the works of Classical authors he has available - Plato, Aristotle, Ptolemy, etc - or as transmitted the summaries of Boethius, Cassiodorus and other Dark Age writers. This encyclopaedic work will remain one of the few reference for Classical learning for centuries to come.  Among the more amusing definitions, in his entries on money (Etymologies xvi: 18), Isidore suggests that the term moneta (coinage) comes from monet (third person of ""monere"", ""to warn"")  ""because it warns lest any fraud should enter into its composition or weight"", that nomisma (a coin) comes from nomen (meaning ""name"") ""because it bears the imprint of the name and likeness of a prince"" and that nummus (coin pieces) are so called because Numa Pompilus, an early King of Rome, ""was the first among the Latins to mark them with the imprint of his image and name."" Isidore founded his own school at Seville and was the leading figure at the Fourth Council of Toledo, promulgating the establishment of seminaries in all the cathedrals of Spain, under the special responsibility of the bishops, and the promotion of the study of Greek, Hebrew, the seven liberal arts, law and medicine. Isidore is also commonly credited for introduced the famous flat T-O 'disc-shaped' earth hypothesis that will be adhered to in nearly all Christian mappa mundi until the 16th C.

Achylle-Nicolas Isnard, 1749-1803.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/isnard.htm,"   Achylle-Nicolas Isnard was one of the first of a long string of French engineers who dedicated their spare time to economics.  Born in Paris, Isnard was a graduate of the  École des Ponts et Chaussées and worked as an engineer on roads and canals in the Besançon region. Isnard was aware of the economic debates of the Enlightenment era and was particularly critical of the Physiocratic doctrine.  In his Traité des richesses (published anonymously in 1781), Isnard sought to show arithmetically that industry, and not only agriculture, could produce a produit net.  He also showed that the surplus accrues not to landlords as such, but to all owners of scarce factors of production.  More originally, Isnard addressed the determination of prices in an exchange economy.  He set the problem out mathematically in a multi-good scenario as a system of equations,  counting equations and unknowns, determining the numeraire, etc.  Isnard's work was highly influential upon Léon Walras. Isnard's Traité was not well-received at the time - indeed he got upbraided by Jean-Rodolphe Peronnet, the director of the EPC, for not having sought permission to publish it. At the outset of the 1789 Revolution, Isnard unwisely published a pro-monarchy pamphlet.  In spite of this, he was nonetheless appointed chief engineer in Lyons and participated in post-revolutionary politics and administration.  From December 1799 to March 1802, Isnard was a member of Napoleon's Tribunat, with special charge of public finances.  He died in Lyons in 1803.

Edmund J. James, 1855-1925,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/james.htm," American historicist economist and the first professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania.. A native of Jackson, Illinois.  After obtaining his undergraduate education at Northwestern and Harvard, Edmund J. James pursued graduate studies at the University of Halle in Germany in 1875, where he came under the influence of Johannes Conrad and the German Historical School.  After obtaining his Ph.D at Halle in in 1877, James returned to the US.  Like many of the ""new generation"", James found the old American universities were uninterested in the German-trained crop.  James ended up teaching high school in Illinois for a while.  In 1883, James was appointed professor of public finance and administration at the newly-opened Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, the first business school in the United States. He doubled the appointment with professor of political and social science in Penn's Department of Philosophy.  James threw himself into developing Wharton as a professional school, a task in which he was assisted by his old Halle classmate Simon Nelson Patten (who arrived at Penn in 1888).  James developed a four-year curriculum for Wharton in 1894. E. J. James was a founding member of the American Economic Association, but soon balked at its dominance by Hopkins.

Jean Jaurès, 1859-1914,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/jaures.htm," Reformist French socialist leader, supporter of the Marxist revisionist, Eduard Bernstein. A former teacher, Jean Jaurès started out as a republican when first elected to the French chamber of deputies in 1885.  In the 1890s, Jean Jaurès gravitated left, and cut a notable public figure as an independent socialist and theorist of social democracy. He stressed the humanitarian aspects of Marxian socialism and its compatibility with French republican values. One of the first to draw attention to the Socialist Calculation problem. Jean Jaurès was a founder of the reformist French Socialist Party (Parti socialiste français, PSF) in 1902, which merged various older gradualist parties, in contradistinction with the revolutionary Socialist Party of France (Parti socialiste de France, PSdF) led by Marxists Jules Guesde, Paul Lafargue and Blanquist Édouard Vaillant.  The two socialist parties would merge in 1905 to form a single large French socialist party, the Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière (SFIO).  Jaurès assumed a leading role in the SFIO. For his opposition to militarism and war, Jean Jaurès was assassinated in a Parisian cafe by a nationalist on the eve of World War I.

Richard Jennings, 1814-1891,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/jennings.htm,"Obscure British proto-Marginalist economist.   Very little is known about Richard Jennings, save that he was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and subsequently became a lawyer and landowner in Carmarthernshire (South Wales) Richard Jennings published two tracts in 1855 on 1856, which may have been influenced by his Cambridge master Whewell, and possibly the Oxford-Dublin school of Whately and Senior (although Jennings's argument most resembles their successor W.F. Lloyd, the latter is nowhere cited)..  Jennings denounced the Ricardian labour theory of value, calling it ""the great fundamental fallacy"" (1856: p.12).  But, more than his contemporaries, Jennings emphasized reduction of economics to human psychology and drew particularly on the hedonistic psychological theory of James Mill.  He saw the usefulness of mathematics in bringing these two together (e.g. 1855: p.35). Jennings had a clear notion of diminishing marginal utility to consumption, e.g.  ""With respect to all Commodities, our feelings show that the degrees of satisfaction do not proceed pari passu with the quantities consumed -- they do not advance equally with each instalment of the Commodity offered to the senses, and then suddenly stop, -- but diminish gradually, until they ultimately disappear and instalments can produce no further satisfaction.  In this progressive scale the increments of sensation resulting from equal increments of the Commodity are obviously less and less at each step."" (Jennings, 1855: p.98-9). He also described the notion of increasing distutility of labor (p.116) and noted how the combination of these two laws could explain economic behavior (p.142).   Jennings failed to proceed systematically along this route to a fully-fledged Marginalist theory of value, but he came quite close to it: ""...no Value can be attached to a limited amount of such objects as exist in unlimited quantities, for the obvious reason that if such an amount were to be withheld, others of equal magnitude could be substituted for it, and this until all the wants of human nature should be satiated.  We further observed, that when a moderate quantity of a Commodity has reached the senses of the consumer, each successive addition of the Commodity produces sensations progressively less and less satisfactory, and vice versa; hence we concluded that, in proportion as objects are less abundant, any limited quantity must be held more valuable, and in proportion as they are more abundant, it must be held less valuable, the Value of every Commodity being dissipated as it increases in quantity, like a circle in the wager, till ""by broad spreading it disperse to naught."""" (Jennings, 1855: p.208-9). Jennings's work was denounced by J.E. Cairnes (1857), who saw his attempt to marry economics and phsyico-psychology as being completely off-the-wall.  But W. Stanley Jevons was much impressed by Jennings and quoted him extensively in his 1871 treatise.

Jeremiah W. Jenks, 1856-1929,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/jenks.htm,"American Institutionalist economist and political scientist at Cornell. Born and raised in St. Clair, to a devout Congrgationalist family in rural Michigan, Jeremiah Whipple Jenks obtained his B.A. from the University of Michigan in 1878.  Jenks subsequently became a classics literature teacher at Mount Morris College in Illinois.  Jenks was soon saddled with teaching political economy classes at Mount Morris, which he had never studied, but his interest in the topic was piqued.  Jenks spent several years teaching at Mount Morris, interrupted only by a brief period studying law in Port Huron.  Eventually, like many of the  ""new generation"", Jenks proceeded abroad for graduate study in Germany.  He obtained his doctorate at the University of Halle under the German Historicist Johannes Conrad in 1885, with a dissertation on the American economist Henry C. Carey.

After returning to the United States, Jenks moved to Illinois, and taught high school in Peoria, before being picked up by Knox College in 1886. In 1889, Jenks became professor of economics and social science at Indiana University in Bloomington. In 1891, Jenks was appointed professor of ""political, municipal and social institutions"" at Cornell University, bringing along his former Indiana student, Frank A. Fetter as instructor.  Jenks presided at Cornell for the next twenty years, with frequent interruption to serve on a variety of official US commissions in Washington, DC. Interested in the political side of economic issues, Jeremiah Jenks wrote many studies and reports on trusts, currency, labor and immigration.  A Progressive by political stripe and a friend of Theodore Roosevelt, Jenks was placed as an expert on trusts and industrial combinations in the celebrated Industrial Commission in 1899 which produced a massive multi-volume report on the state of US industry and business (1900-02).  He also wrote a report on trusts for the US department of labor in 1900.  Jenks's reports would serve as the backdrop for Roosevelt's campaign of trust-busting.  In 1901, Jenks was appointed to serve as a special US commissioner for the Far East, going on to travel around Asia and investigate the economic institutions in British and Dutch colonies, so as to advise the new American colonial policy in the Philippines.  In 1903, Jenks was appointed by Roosevelt to head a commission of international exchange to establish a gold exchange system for silver-using Mexico and China and the Philippines. In 1907, Roosevelt appointed Jenks to head the commission on immigration. In 1912, Jenks left Cornell to become head of the Alexander Hamilton Institute in New York, and subsequently took an appointment in the department of government at New York University.

Jerome of Antioch, 347-420,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/jerome.htm," Eusebius Sophronius Hieronymus, better known as St. Jerome of Antioch (or Stridonium) is regarded as one of the four ""Great Doctors"" of the Christian Church. Originally a Latin-speaking Roman of Illyrian origin, raised as a pagan, Jerome converted to Christianity c.366 while a student in Rome.   Around 374, Jerome moved east, and pursued a monastic vocation as a hermit in the desert of Chalcis (Qinnasrin, Syria).  He gave up after three years, and moved to Antioch, where he was ordained a priest in 378.  Having learned Hebrew and Greek, Jerome dedicated himself to scriptural studies, and quickly made a name for himself as a scholar. He translated Origen's homilies and Eusebius's history from Greek to Latin.  During this period, Jerome came under the influence of the Cappadocian fathers  (esp. Gregory of Nazianzus, but also Gregory of Nyssa and John Chrysostom).  Jerome was in Constantinople at the time of the Second Ecumenical Council (381)  that restored Nicene (Orthodox Catholic) Christianity in the Roman Empire In 382, Jerome attended the Council of Rome convened by Pope Damasus and Archbishop Ambrose of Milan.  It was this council  that first set down the canonical books of the Christian Bible (""Gelasian Decree"").  St. Jerome was commissioned by the Council to provide a new Latin translation of the New Testament - what became known as the ""Latin Vulgate"" version.  Jerome's prefaces and commentaries on the books of the Bible contain some of his most accessible theological ideas.  Jerome's reflections on usury can be found in his commentaries on Ezekiel 18.   After Pope Damasus's death, Jerome left Rome in 385, and wandered in the east for a while.  He eventually settled down as a monk in Bethlehem, Palestine, where he deepened his knowledge of Hebrew to undertake the translation of Old Testament.  It was also there that Jerome engaged in polemics against the free-will theologian Pelagius and his followers (whom had fled to Palestine after being hounded out of Carthage in 412).  Jerome struck up an important correspondence with Augustine over the Pelagian controversy.      Major Works of St. Jerome Resources on St. Jerome All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
William Stanley Jevons , 1835-1882.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/jevons.htm,"  English economist and logician whom, simultaneously with Carl Menger and Léon Walras, launched the Marginalist Revolution of 1871-4 that gave birth to Neoclassical economics. Stanley Jevons (as he preferred to be called) was born in Liverpool on September 1, 1835, the ninth child of a family of prosperous iron merchants.   However, the death of his mother in 1845 and the collapse of the family firm in 1848 circumscribed Jevons's opportunities.  His early education was acquired at home, the Liverpool Mechanics Institute and finally at a preparatory school in London.   As a Unitarian (a liberal non-conformist Protestant sect), Jevons was legally barred from taking the traditional educational route through Oxford, Cambridge, etc.   So, in 1852, Jevons entered University College London (UCL), a Benthamite institution that accepted non-conformists, to study chemistry, mathematics and logic.  It was here that he came under the influence of the logician Augustus De Morgan.  However, financial circumstance forced him to withdraw in his second year and accept a post as Assayer at the new Royal Mint in Sydney, Australia.  After arriving in Sydney in 1854, Jevons spent his spare time (and there was plenty of it, as the mint was still not ready) studying the climate, geography, geology and flora of Australia.  He took daily meteorological observations (routinely forwarded to the Sydney newspaper Empire) and hobnobbed with the local scientific community.  A local dispute over railway funding led Jevons to study up on economics. It was in connection with this that Jevons acquired a copy Dionysus Lardner's 1850 book, Railway Economy, which, significantly, contained a geometric treatment of demand and supply.  After his father's death in 1855 and a bit of soul-searching, Jevons returned to London in 1859 and earned his B.A. in at UCL in 1860.  His M.A. in Logic, Philosophy and Political Economy was acquired in 1862.  In that same year, Jevons sent two papers to the British Association meetings at Oxford. The first discussed his ideas about how to introduce mathematical methods and subjective utility into economics (a version was later published in 1866).  The second paper was a study of seasonal fluctuations in economic activity. In 1863, Jevons published a monograph computing the impact of the Australian and Canadian gold rushes on the general price level (here, he introduced a novel method of constructing price indexes using the geometric mean).  None of these early economic publications garnered much response, so he moved back to philosophy and logic.  In 1863,  Jevons published his Pure Logic, wherein he improved the symbolic logic schema pioneered by George Boole and his teacher Augustus De Morgan.  Jevons also introduced his own system of logic, the ""substitution of similars"" (restated in 1869).  In essence, Jevons forwarded the idea that logical problems can be resolved exactly like algebraic equations just by stating the statements symbolically and then substituting elements with similar properties.  For instance, ""All men are mortal"" and ""Socrates is man"" is resolved quickly by the algebra-like substitution of the common element in both statements (""man""), to yield the conclusion ""Socrates is mortal"".  This may seem self-evident for simple syllogisms, but Jevons was convinced that more complex logical problems could be solved in this manner.    Jevons spent the next few years working as a tutor and part-time lecturer at Owens College in Manchester and Queen's College in Liverpool, which translated into professorships in political economy in 1865.  It was during this time that he wrote his 1865 Coal Question, an alarmist treatise drawing attention to the imminent exhaustion of energy supplies.  It was in here that the so-called ""Jevons Paradox"" was first posited, i.e. that an improvement in the efficiency of resource-use leads to an increase (rather than a decrease) in the use of that resource.  The book sold well and was widely discussed in government circles.  It brought a small degree of fame to the young Jevons. In 1866, Jevons returned to his study of periodic fluctuations outlined earlier in 1862, noting how 'breaches in credit' in the crises of 1836-37, 1847 and 1857 seemed to be concentrated in the months of October and November and speculating on the possible causes of high pressure during those months.  Following the cycle data of fellow Mancunian John Mills, Jevons unveiled his climate theory of cycles more fully in 1867-8. He followed this up with a series of insightful papers on currency and coinage (later collected in his Investigations (1884)).  In 1866, Jevons was appointed Professor of Logic and Philosophy at Owens College and, soon after, he married Harriet Ann Taylor (no, not that one; this one was the daughter of a newspaper baron, the founder of the Manchester Guardian).  Jevons returned to logic around this time, further developing the ""logical alphabets"" of Boolean schemata.  Due to his power as a popularizer (e.g. 1870, 1876), many of Jevons's innovations continue today (e.g. the removal of subtraction and division, the inclusion of ""both"" in the disjunctive ""either...or"", etc.).  As he hammered the symbolic method into shape, Jevons became particularly entranced by the way logical problems could be resolved by just repeatedly applying simple, mechanical rules.  In 1870, he unveiled his famous ""logical piano"" at a Royal Society meeting -- a primitive, three-foot computer which solved logical calculations at superhuman speed via keys, pulleys and switches (see image).  As he wrote: ""To the reader of the preceding paper it will be evident that mechanism is capable of replacing for the most part the action of thought required in the performance of logical deduction. Mental agency is required only in interpreting correctly the grammatical structure of the premises, and in gathering the purport of the reply... The machine is thus the embodiment of a true symbolic method or Calculus"" (Jevons, 1870: p.517). His research on logic was interrupted in 1870 when Fleeming Jenkin sent him a copy of his pamphlet on mathematical economics.  Fearful of being upstaged, Jevons dashed off his Theory of Political Economy in 1871, expanding on the themes of his earlier 1866 paper and launching the Marginalist Revolution in the process.  Jevons's TPE begins by outlining the principle of diminishing marginal utility and showed how it governed individual choice via the equimarginal principle.  Proceeding on to the context of a pure exchange economy, Jevons showed how this principle served as a foundation for a new and comprehensive theory of value.  By combining two ""laws"" of exchange -- that every exchange must be mutually beneficial and that every portion must be exchanged at the same rate (his famous ""Law of Indifference"") -- Jevons came to the conclusion that a higgledy-piggledy exchange process (without price-taking behavior) will work its way necessarily to the market equilibrium.  Several reviewers, most notably Francis Ysidro Edgeworth (1881), disputed this conclusion, arguing that the point at which exchange would cease was indeterminate.  Although  Jevons acknowledged that indeterminacy would arise if indivisible commodities were involved, he did not see the connection Edgeworth was trying to make between indeterminacy and the ""degree of competition"". In his attempt to extend his theory to a production economy, Jevons introduced his disutility theory of labor supply (which later precipitated a debate over cost theory) and his time-dependent theory of capital (anticipating the Austrians).  Although these ideas were individually groundbreaking, they were not very well-integrated with each other or the remainder of his theory.  Unbeknownst to Jevons, Carl Menger (1871) had just published a book expounding the same theory and, a little while later, Léon Walras (1874) presented his own version.  The Marginalist Revolution had taken hold independently at three axes.  Jevons got in contact with Walras in 1874 -- the latter recognized the former's claim to precedence, while the former recognized the latter's claim of independent discovery.  They promised to join forces to perpetuate the new gospel but, for reasons not altogether clear, Jevons did a bit less than he promised to do.  Despite the fact that both men traveled to each other's countries on several occasions, they never succeeding in meeting. Soon after the publication of the Theory, Jevons grew gradually aware that, in fact, many other earlier writers -- such as Cournot and Gossen -- had anticipated many of his economic ideas.  He was half-disappointed by this, but, at the same time, it confirmed his conviction that his theory was probably right.  In his revolutionary zeal, Jevons had not withheld his punches, bitterly accusing the reigning (but moribund) Ricardian School -- particularly John Stuart Mill -- of seriously retarding the development of economics through ""the noxious influence of authority"" (Jevons, 1871: p.275).  Contemporary Classical economists realized that Jevons was calling for subversion and responded accordingly, thereby inadvertently make his theory better known.  In 1874, Jevons published his masterpiece of scientific methodology, Principles of Science, wherein he presented his theory of scientific inference.  Following up on De Morgan and Whewell, Jevons took aim at the empirical approach of  John Stuart Mill.  Induction, Jevons claimed, ""is simply an inverse employment of deduction."" (1874: p.viii).  While championing the hypothetico-deductive method, Jevons recognized that it yielded, at best, only partial knowledge. In order to make a ""perfect"" induction, Jevons argued, it is necessary to list in the premises all the possible cases or instances from which the empirical conclusion can be derived.  But, in most matters, such a complete enumeration cannot be done in practice.  As a result, Jevons's argued,  ""general laws"" are at best only ""probable"".  He introduced, in the process, an epistemological theory of probability, arguing that probabilities are mere ""measures of ignorance"" or, as he liked to call it, measures of ""rational expectation"" (i.e. reasonable belief).   Jevons's ""inverse probability"" theory of induction argues that we can deduce the ""most probable"" cause of an event by examining all possible hypotheses (all equally likely), deducing all possible consequences from them, comparing these consequences with the facts and then picking the hypothesis which is most likely to yield that event: ""If an event can be produced by any one of a certain number of different causes, all equally probable a priori, the probabilities of the existence of these causes as inferred from the event, are proportional to the probabilities of the event as derived from these causes. (Jevons, 1874: p. 242-243). Jevons's method is merely an application of Bayes's Theorem, e.g. suppose P(x | A) = p, P(x | B) = q and P(x | C) = r are the conditional probabilities of consequence x from hypothetical causes A, B and C. So, we can evaluate the hypotheses by calculating P(A | x) = p/(p + q + r), P(B | x) = q/(p+q+r) and P(C | x) = r/(p+q+r) and choosing the one with the greatest probability.  This seems straightforward enough. However, the idea that inductive knowledge was mere probability -- David Hume's old saw -- flew in the face of the scientific consensus of the time and caused a bit of an uproar.   In 1875 and 1878, Jevons read two papers before the British Association which expounded his famous ""sunspot theory"" of the business cycle.  Digging through mountains of statistics of economic and meteorological data, Jevons argued that there was a connection between the timing of commercial crises and the solar cycle.  The basic chain of events was that variations in sunspots affect the power of the sun's rays, influencing the bountifulness of harvests and thus the price of corn which, in turn, affected business confidence and gave rise to commercial crises.  Jevons changed his story several times (e.g. he replaced his European harvest-price-crisis logic with an Indian harvest-imports-crisis channel).  However flimsy his explanations, Jevons believed that the periodicity of the solar cycle and commercial crises -- approximately 10.5 years, by his calculations -- was too coincidental to be dismissed.  Needless to say, all this was a bit on the cranky end and, ultimately, the statistics did not bear him out.  Nonetheless, it remains a significant piece of work as this was perhaps the first time that the phenomenon of the business cycle was identified.  Economists had long been aware that business activity had its ups and downs, but not that they necessarily followed any regular pattern.  They generally believed that ""crises"" arrived haphazardly, punctuating the smooth advance of the economy at irregular intervals. Jevons was perhaps the first economist to argue that the phases of business activity had a regular, measurable and predictable periodicity. Although Jevons had renounced Benthamite utilitaranism as a workable political or ethical philosophy in his 1871 Theory (as distinct from the use of the utility concept to illustrate the ""simple and restricted"" problem of economic exchange), his work on social philosophy and public policy (1879, 1882, 1883) resurrected the theme.  Once again, he targeted John Stuart Mill -- particularly his distinction between ""higher"" and ""lower"" pleasures.  Jevons did not deny, to use his famous example, that a public library increased ""social utility"" more than a race-track, but he denied that its superiority lay in Mill's distinction between a ""high quality"" pleasure (reading) and a ""low quality"" pleasure (betting).  Instead, Jevons argued, libraries yield a higher quantity of social utility than racetracks.  Races yield intense but momentary pleasure.  Reading is longer-lasting and more fruitful.  Thus, measured over a lifetime, reading yields a greater quantity of pleasure than betting.  Jevons also denounced Mill for failing to incorporate Spencer's evolutionism into utilitarian doctrine.   Jevons's economic policy positions, although broadly in line with a laissez-faire attitude, fall short of being doctrinaire.  Where government policy can increase happiness in one segment of the population without diminishing that of another, it should be pursued -- albeit with caution to ensure that all indirect effects are accounted for.  Trade unions, to take his famous example, fail on this criteria as their gains often come at the ""expense"" of consumers and non-union workers.  In 1872, Jevons was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and, in 1876, he was appointed Professor of Political Economy at University College London.  Disliking lecturing and plagued by ill-health, he retired in 1880.  Against his doctor's warnings, Jevons continued swimming regularly, his favorite recreational activity.  In 1882, he drowned at sea off Devon.  An avid book-collector, Jevons left behind a library of several thousand volumes and (anticipating a future world-wide shortage), an enormous stock of blank writing paper. The impact of Jevons on economics can hardly be exaggerated.  As the father of Neoclassical economics, his legacy is secure.  However, in some ways, he stopped short of the mark.  Jevons could have gone further by connecting his insights in pure exchange into a wider theory incorporating production, capital, money and the business cycle in a more systematic and consistent manner that would have knocked the Ricardian School completely out of the picture.  Had he not died so young, Jevons might yet have done so, but the next economics treatise he was working on (published posthumously in 1905), did not really seem to go in that ambitious direction.  As such, by the time of his death, the Marginalist Revolution was still in its insurrectionist phase.  It was still a tentative proposition rather than a firmly-set and integrated system, a scientific hypothesis but not quite yet a science. Strangely enough, the task of completion was taken up by Alfred Marshall, whom Jevons initially thought a disciple but ultimately turned out to be a rival.  Marshall's Neoclassical system, a woolly compromise between the Ricardian and Jevonian theories, was to rule Anglo-Saxon economics for the next half-century.  Jevons's considerably more radical vision was carried on by a small group of followers -- notably Francis Ysidro Edgeworth and Philip H. Wicksteed.   In the 1930s, as the Marshallian consensus collapsed, Jevonian radicalism re-emerged in Britain (esp. at the L.S.E.), this time hand-in-hand with the Austrian and Lausanne theories.

Alvin S. Johnson, 1874-1971,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/asjohnson.htm,"  Nebraska-born economist, Alvin Saunders Johnson was trained under E.R.A. Seligman and John Bates Clark at Columbia, acquiring his doctorate in 1901.  Johnson was, for a while, Clark's personal secretary and heir apparent at Columbia.  Although Johnson had been trained as a thorough Neoclassical, he was not opposed to the Institutionalist approach.  Nonetheless, Jacob Viner would comment that ""For England, Wicksteed, and for the United States, Alvin Johnson (and Fetter?) appear to be the sole surviving upholders of the original Austrian position."" (Viner, 1925: p.371).  After teaching at Columbia for a number of years, Johnson moved to the University of Nebraska in 1906, then on to the University of Texas at Austin in 1907, the University of Chicago in 1909, Stanford in 1911 and then Cornell in 1912 (where he was Frank Knight's teacher).  After taking leave from academia to work as editor of the New Republic, Johnson took up another appointment at Stanford, only to leave again in 1917 to work on the wartime Council of National Defense in Washington D.C.   In 1918, Alvin S. Johnson helped found the New School for Social Research in New York.  He took over as director in 1922 and guided the fledgling institution for the next few decades.   In the 1920s, Alvin Johnson worked with E.R.A. Seligman on editing the massive Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences.  In the 1930s and 1940s, as the Fascist and Nazi specter cast its darkness over Europe, Johnson worked overtime to saving numerous Central European scholars from persecution, bringing them to the  ""University in Exile"", an especially-created division of the New School.

The son of a schoolmaster, W.E. Johnson was born, raised, educated and made his career in Cambridge.  Attending King's College on a mathematical scholarship, Johnson grew particularly inclined towards logic and took his degree through the Moral Sciences tripos.  After a brief spell earning a living as a mathematics tutor, from 1887 to 1900, Johnson taught logic, psychology and education at various Cambridge colleges.  In 1902, Johnson was elected a fellow of King's and obtained the Sidgwick Lectureship in moral sciences, positions he would maintain for the remainder of his life.  He was a teacher of John Maynard Keynes. Scarely publishing, W.E. Johnson maintained an interest in economics.  His reputation rests largely on his famous 1913 paper, which independently derived demand functions from indifference curves (and placed them in the form we use today). Showed ""paradox"" that convex indifference curves could yield upward-sloping demand. Defined substitutes and complements in terms of rates of change of marginal rates of substitution.

Richard Jones, 1790-1855.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/jones.htm," Often regarded as the founder of the English Historical School, Richard Jones was a Cambridge-trained Anglican clergyman.  The son of a lawyer from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, of Welsh descent, Richard Jones was initially groomed to become a lawyer.  But health considerations led to a reassessment and he decided on a clerical career.  Jones entered Caius College, Cambridge in 1812, at an age older than most students.  While at Cambridge, he fell in with the scientific circle around Charles Babbage, William Hershel and William Whewell and proposed to apply its inductivist methodology to political economy.   Jones received his degree in 1816 and, in 1817, Jones was ordained into the Church of England.  He was assigned to various ministries in Sussex, but kept up his wider interests and contacts with the Cantabrigians (Whewell dedicated his famous History to Jones). In 1831, Richard Jones published his Essay, the first volume (""Rent"") of a never-completed multi-volume treatise, in which Jones attacked the Ricardian theory of rent. Drawing on a much larger span of historical data, Jones showed that rising rents were not correlated with the extension of cultivation on to ever-worse soils, as the Ricardians asserted.  He did not deny that it could happen that way, but that it was perhaps the least important of causes.  The primary cause of rises in rent, Jones argued, came from rising surplus on already-cultivated fields -- due primarily to the sheer increase in capital applied to existing lands and improvements in the techniques of production.   As for the Ricardian explanation of the fact of rent -- i.e. as a ""mechanism"" to equalize differing fertilities of land -- Jones has only contempt.  Instead, Jones notes that ""in the actual progress of human society, rent has usually originated in the appropriation of the soil, at a time when the bulk of the people must cultivate it on such terms as they can, or starve; and ... are chained ... to the land by an overpowering necessity; the necessity then which compels them to pay a rent .. is wholly independent of any difference in the quality of the ground they occupy, and would not be removed were the soil all equalised."" (Jones, 1851: p.11).   It is in passages such as these that Jones reveals his historicist credentials.  Jones derided the Ricardians for their lack of empirical content and sensitivity to historical fact, their pretensions to a mechanical ""scientific"" universalism and the political-apologistic tones of their wages-fund and rent doctrines.  Karl Marx would adopt several of Jones's more pregnant ideas. In 1833, Richard Jones was appointed to succeed the scandal-ridden Nassau William Senior as professor of political economy at King's College (London).  His introductory lecture at KCL (delivered February, 1833) was a methodological piece, a manifesto of the inductive-empirical method.   In 1835, he left King's to take up Malthus's old chair as Professor of Political Economy and Modern History at the East India College of Haileybury, which he held until his death.  (After Jones's departure, the KCL chair was left vacant for decades thereafter; the Tooke Professorship was not created until 1859). Richard Jones had a large part in forging the 1836 Commutation of Tithes Act (6 & 7 Will IV c.71), converting tithes-in-kind with cash payments (""corn rent"") and served as one of the three commissioners charged with implementing the conversion, undertaking the survey and identifying the affected properties.  His position on the tithe commission took up most of his time in the 1840s, although Jones still retained his chair at Haileybury.  The tithe commission was dissolved in 1851, upon which Jones joined the Charity Commission.      Major Works of Richard Jones     Resources on Richard Jones All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Thomas Joplin, 1790-1847.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/joplin.htm,"Newcastle timber merchant and banker.  Thomas Joplin exploded into print with his 1822 essay on banking, forwarding reform of the Bank of England charter to expand banking in Britain.  Following the crisis of 1826-27, Parliament, in an effort to revive Britain's banking system, initiated a series of reforms, notably repealing the old prohibition on the formation of joint-stock banks - albeit limiting their area of operation to a outside of London.  But Joplin, already in the supplement to the third edition of the essay (1823), had noticed that the Bank of England's charter prevented only the formation of other note-issuing but not deposit-taking banks within the London radius.  Although the government's counsel admitted Joplin's interpretation of the clause was legally correct, private banks were reluctant to embrace the scheme so long as doubts lingered.  As the Bank of England's charter was up for renewal, Joplin went on the pamphleteering offensive, urging the government to reform.  Overruling the Bank's protests, in 1833, the government assented to Joplin, and inserted a declaratory clause, making it explicitly legal for deposit-taking joint-stock banks to establish themselves inside of London.  Joplin's campaign led to an explosion of the creation of joint-stock banks within the London radius in the 1830s.  Joplin himself was a founder of the National Provincial Bank. But the Bank of England did not admit defeat, and pushed for the creation of a new Parliamentary Commission in 1836 to examine the ""danger"" of the new joint-stock banks.  Joplin went on a propaganda offensive, not only in pamphlets but also founded a magazine in 1837, The Economist, to popularize his program, making sure to forward a copy to each member of parliament (Joplin's short-lived rag should not be confused with the namesake publication, founded by James Wilson in 1843, that continues to this day.) However, Joplin's reforms got a serious setback in the Panic of 1837, where the easy credit and speculative excesses of the new joint-stock banks were blamed.  This would pave the way for the heavy-handed Bank Acts of 1844. Joplin is commonly credited as developer of the ""currency principle"" - effectively, 100% gold reserve currency - behind the Currency School's position in the debate leading up to the 1844 Bank Reform Act.

Clément Juglar, 1819-1905.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/juglar.htm," French physician, statistician and business cycle pioneer.  Son of a Parisian doctor, Clément Juglar was trained as a physician, obtaining his doctorate in Paris in 1846 with a thesis on pulmonary ailments. Despite a promising start in medicine, Juglar was drawn to economic questions following the events of 1848. By 1851, Juglar was writing on tariff reform (a policy quarrel) and attempting a statistical analysis of patterns of births, deaths and marriages in the French population. In 1856, Juglar published his celebrated first article on economic crises, followed in 1857 by articles around the Panic of 1857.  In 1860, Juglar presented his famous study of business cycles, before the Académie des sciences morales et politiques, which was subsequently crowned by the academy and published in 1862 as Des crises commerciales.  Juglar rejected most 'exogenous' theories of the cycle (e.g. climate, note issue, monopolies etc.), and was one of the earliest proponents for the development of a proper ""economic"" theory of the business cycle, and thus can be called the father of business cycle theory,  He pinned the explanation on the self-perpetuating psychology of speculation, built up during a boom, and excessive use of credit, leading to mismatch between bills and bullion in bank reserves, that can accentuate the crisis by forcing banks to raise interest rates and provoke a credit crunch.. His findings on credit cycles spurred the subsequent efforts of overinvestment theorists such as Tugan-Baranovsky. Juglar believed this pattern was inevitable, and identified a 8.7 year pattern of boom and bust not only in France, but also in the UK and the USA.  Decades later, Schumpeter baptized the 7-11 industrial cycle as 'the Juglar Cycle'. Juglar suggested the bullion reserves of banks as the prime indicator of the cycle phase, and spent much of the remainder of his career focusing on this.  In 1865, Juglar directed the compilation and translation of English articles on British banking and money debates (e.g. Bullion debate).  In 1868, Juglar won another contest at the academy with his study on private banknote issue, noting that it had little or nothing to do with economic crisis.  Juglar produced articles on credit cycles for Leon Say's dictionary and in 1882 a new expanded edition of his 1862 treatise and several more inquires into monetary and credit crisis questions.

Johannes Heinrich von Justi, 1717-1771.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/justi.htm,"One of the giants of German Neo-Cameralism  the details of the peripatic Justi's life are obscure.  After early schooling at Quedlinburg, Justi enlisted in the army and served in the War of Austrian Succession.  There he became the private secretary of a certain Lt. Col von Gersdorff, who instilled in the young Justi a passion for further learning.  Justi enrolled at the University of Wittenberg in Saxony in 1742, followed up by studies at Jena and Leipzig, obtaining his degree with a thesis on military desertion (1744).   After the death of his mentor, Justi remained in Dresden and got married.  In 1745, Justi published a feeble Swift-like satire, Der Dichterinsel and began publishing a monthly magazine, Ergetzungen.  Justi moved to Sangerhausen and entered into the service of the Duchess of Saxe-Eisenach in 1747.  There, he published a monograph calling for a review of Leibniz's theory of monads.  Justi's essay was crowned in a competition by the Berlin Academy of Sciences.  But Justi's siding with Newton in this debate outraged many German academics. In 1750, leaving both philosophy and Germany behind, Justi moved to Vienna and took up an appointment at the Collegium Theresianum, an academy recently set up to train young aristocrats bound for the civil service.  Lecturing in economics was expected, and Justi duly delved into Cameralist literature.  In 1752, he composed a prospectus to the Austrian Empress Maria Theresa outlining a course of Cameralistic study. Justi's outline would be used as the basis of a course of study by later Austrian professors, like Sonnenfels. But just as soon as he arrived, he left.  In 1753, for unknown reasons (possibly friction with ecclesiastical authorities), Justi left Austria and returned to Saxony.  In Mansfeld, he founded a new journal and then proceeded to Leipzig in 1755, long enough to publish his first three tracts in economics -- the Erkenntinis, the Staatswirtshaft (his major work), and an anonymous pamphlet on monetary reform (Entdeckte, etc.).  Before the end of 1755, Justi left Leipzig for Göttingen, where he had the opportunity to lecture on Cameralism at the local university, while taking an administrative post. He wrote his Policeywissenschaft during this time. But just as Justi's life seemed about to settle, things quickly unravelled.  The Seven Years' War broke out in 1756 and Justi leaped into the fray as a propagandist, aiming peculiar ruminations about Jesuit plots, claiming they had hoarded a treasure earmarked for the conversion of Protestant Germans. That same year, Justi's marriage broke down, ending in a spectacular public divorce (Justi duly published a book on marriage law). Justi was forced to sell his library to pay for the alimony.  His subsequent books on mining and manufacturing (1757) were written basically without it. Hoping to put it all behind him, Justi left Göttingen in 1757 to take up a post with the King of Denmark.  Justi's sojourn in Denmark lasted less than a year, and he was soon found in Altona in 1759, where he published a series of books on the political issues of the day. His criticism of the conduct of the Austrian and Russian armies landed him in trouble.  To prevent further controversy, at least two of his books had to be published abroad, in the United States.   After Altona, Justi set off for Hamburg and thereafter to Berlin in 1760.  Little is known as bout his activities during this time. His finances precarious, he is said to have been hounded by legions of creditors.  Despite all this, Justi managed to publish several monthly magazines and a head-swirling number of monographs and books, increasingly concentrated on politics and economics, if carelessly-written and bordering on plagiarism..  But he also resumed his studies in other subjects -- on chemistry, history and the natural sciences (usually with an eye on prize competitions). In 1765, Justi entered in the service of the Prussian monarch Frederick II the Great as Berghauptmann in Landsberg, a prominent post. His financial troubles seemed to be behind him.  But things did not go well.  In 1768, after an investigation into financial improprieties instigated by creditors and rivals, Justi was arrested and confined in Kustrin fortress.  He would remain there until his death in 1771..    The Staatwirthschaft (1755) is easily Justi's first major work in economics, a two-volume digest and synthesis of Cameralist literature, drawing upon the lecture notes of Gasser and Dithmar. It is directed mostly to princes and practitioners, rather than students.  After lamenting the state of Cameralist education in Germany, he proceeds to the subject matter.  Justi identifies three sources of increasing the wealth of a nation -- encouraging population growth, a favorable balance of trade in foreign commerce and a step-up in mining activity (Justi had some expertise in mining, having published two books on the subject, 1756 & 1757).  In all of these objectives, Just stresses the responsibility and role of the State. But why?  Justi outlines his political philosophy in two treatises (the Grundriss 1759 and the Natur 1760).  Essentially,  Justi stresses the conjoined happiness of the ruler and the people. ""No one can rule over reasonable and free beings except with the intention of promoting their welfare and making them happy"" (p.33).  In Justi's perspective, then, Cameralism is not so much the economics of state power, but the economics of public happiness, of which the State is an important and indispensable actor, not only as the provider of security, but also the guarantor of freedom and the promoter of wealth.. In fact, he pursues the conjectural history that people had ""come together"" in a society precisely for that purpose, a collective will to promote their general happiness.  Although he notes that absolutism, rather than republicanism, is the culmination of that effort.  By handing the single ruler that responsibility for the collective happiness, the people became ""free"" of that ""burden"" and were thus able to concentrate on the calmer pursuit of individual happiness.  The ruler, thus trusted, must meet its obligations to public welfare. However, he also stresses the need to keep checks and balances to maintain the king's ""moral virtue"", which he envisages could be maintained via a series of administrative colleges.  A good and efficient civic structure can prevent any abuses of arbitrary power. The design of this civic structure is the aim behind his Policeywissenschaft (1756), followed up in his Grundfeste (1760-1).  This is meant to complement his other works, the details of proper administrative structure to assist the practical internal objectives of cultivation of land, improving the laboring classes and maintaining discipline and order in the community.  Its guiding purpose is that ""the internal institutions of the community must be so arranged that thereby the general means of the state will be preserved and increased and the common happiness constantly promoted"".  In his 1766 Finanzwesens treatise, Justi sets out systematic guidelines for the design of taxation schemes that maximize both state power and general happiness.  Justi's other economic ruminations, particularly his enthusiasm for population growth, are found in his 1760 and 1761-64 collections.

Nicholas Kaldor, 1908-1986.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kaldor.htm," One of the foremost Cambridge economists in the post-war period, Nicholas Kaldor began his professional existence in the Walrasian-Austrian tradition at Robbins's LSE - during which he made important contributions in the theory of equilibrium (1934), the firm (1934, 1935), capital (1939) and particularly, welfare economics, where he developed the famous ""compensation"" criteria for welfare comparisons (1939). After Keynes's General Theory appeared in 1936, Kaldor abandoned his LSE roots and joined the Keynesian Revolution - and even tried to convert Pigou in the process (e.g. 1938)!  His seminal contributions to Keynesian theory include the concept of ""own rates of interest"" and dynamic effects of speculation (1939), the introduction of non-linear dynamics in order to create an endogenous theory of the business cycle (1940). Kaldor was also involved in an intense debate (1939, 1942) with F.A. Hayek, which helped bury the latter's venture into business cycle theory. An outgrowth of this, was his construction of the ""Cambridge"" approach to growth theory (1954, 1956, 1961, 1962) which invoked several Ricardian concepts and was to become central to Neo-Ricardian and Post Keynesian theory. He also adopted and developed Veblen's concept of ""cumulative causation"" and Verdoorn's Law (1966, 1970, 1977, 1981) - an early formulation of endogenous growth theory that also became part of the PK arsenal.   Throughout his life, Kaldor remained a staunch critic of Neoclassical economics as a whole, and Monetarism in particular (1970, 1972, 1975, 1977, 1983, 1985), both in theoretical terms and in policy implications.  In the post-war era, Kaldor applied his skills to development policy. Among his policy advice to developing countries was his famous ""Expenditure Tax"" (1955) scheme (which was implemented in India and Sri Lanka, when Kaldor worked as an advisor to both countries) and his Bancor ""Commodity Reserve Currency"" scheme (1964, with Hart and Tinbergen), is yet to be taken up. Although his contributions to economics have been numerous and in many fields, Kaldor may be best remembered in forging, together with Joan Robinson, the core of the Cambridge School and its offshoots - the Neo-Ricardian and Post Keynesian schools.

Michal Kalecki, 1899-1970.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kalecki.htm," In his lifetime, Polish economist Michal Kalecki was one of the unsung heroes of macroeconomics - and a potent lesson in why, in economics, one should always publish in English. Although Kalecki claimed to have anticipated much of the principles stated in Keynes's General Theory, his articles (1933, 1935) were published in Polish and French and thus went unrecognized. Attempting to rectify this, Kalecki decided to publish a claim of precedence to Keynes in a 1936 article... but in Polish again! Kalecki's work in English, notably on business cycles (1935, 1937, 1939, 1943, 1954) introduced him in his own stead and was notable in its advancement of the use of mathematical dynamics in economics. His work also incorporated several Classical and Marxian concepts, relying to a good extent on ""class conflict"", income distribution and imperfect competition - items which would inspire the Cambridge Keynesians - particularly Robinson, Kaldor and Goodwin - as well as modern ""American"" Post Keynesian economics (e.g. Harris, Steindl). Kalecki worked at the Institute of Business Cycles and Prices in Warsaw for much of the early part of his life.  In 1937, while Kalecki was spending a year abroad, part of it at Cambridge, his old supervisor in Warsaw was fired, and Kalecki resigned in protest, and extended his stay in England. Probably just in the nick of time - as, given his Jewish heritage and socialist leanings, Kalecki was unlikely to survive for long in Nazi-occupied Poland.  Needing a new perch, in 1940, Kalecki was hired by the newly-created Oxford Institute for Statistics, where he remained throughout the war.  Resigning from Oxford in 1945, Kalecki spent a couple of years roaming around, before finally joining the UN Secretariat in New York in 1947.  Disenchanted by the tide of McCarthyism in the US, Kalecki resigned in 1955 and returned to (now communist) Poland, resuming his position at the considerably-transformed Warsaw Institute.

"Henry Home, Lord Kames", 1696-1782,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kames.htm,"   Scottish jurist, legal historian and philosopher, godfather of the Scottish Enlightenment.  Unlike many other Scottish philosophers, Henry Home (pronounced ""Hume"") was not an academic - indeed, Home did not even attend a university.  A son of modest Scottish gentry, Home was spottily educated and initially apprenticed by indenture to a writer (Scottish equivalent of a solicitor) at a law office in Edinburgh, before changing tack and embarking on a legal career as an advocate (Scottish barrister) under the sponsorship of the Dalrymple family.  Home was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1723.  Never the most sparkling of orators, Home made his legal reputation by his quiet reasoning skill and particularly in his writing - beginning with his 1728 collection.  His legal career subsequently flourished.  Kames rose to senior examiner of the Faculty of Advocates and in 1737, became a curator of the Library of Advocates.  Henry Home was made ""Lord Kames"" (sometimes spelled ""Kaims"") in 1752 on becoming a judge (Lord Ordinary) in the Scottish Court of Session.  Kames was one of the judges that presided over the celebrated 1777 case of Joseph Knight, a West Indian slave brought by his master to Scotland, and handed down the decision that outlawed slavery in Scotland. Despite his daily legal business, Henry Home (Lord Kames) mentored many of the leading lights of the early Scottish Enlightenment.   As arguably Scotland's most accomplished jurist, Kames was an outsized figure in Edinburgh, and his offices at the law courts and the library of advocates were a gravitational point for the aspiring young Edinburgh intellectuals of the mid-18th C.  Kames was a relative of David Hume - they first met in 1727, and Kames soon became Hume's mentor, helping guide the latter's writings and career. Kames was instrumental in securing Hume a position as librarian at the Library of Advocates after attempts to land an academic job failed.  Kames also persuaded and arranged for the unemployed young Adam Smith to undertake his famous freelance lectures on rhetoric and jurisprudence in Edinburgh in the 1748-51, launching his academic career. John Millar was employed as tutor to Kames's son.   Other figures in Kames's orbit included Sir James Steuart, John Dalrymple, Adam Ferguson, James Boswell,  etc. Kames was the elder statesman of the ""Select Society"" of Edinburgh in the 1750s, the academy set up by the Enlightenment intelligentsia, that met weekly at the Library of Advocates, and transferred to the Poker Club later in the 1760s.  Kames maintained an active correspondence with most of the Enlightenment figures.    David Hume called Kames the ""best friend I ever possessed"" but also ""the most arrogant man in the world"".  Although Kames was influential in forming Hume's empirical philosophy, he also felt Hume took it too far.  Kames anonymously published a 1751 Essays on Morality, disputing some of the more excessive points of Hume's theory of morals, religion and philosophy.  Kames's essay sparked much commentary and ended up giving Hume further publicity (the anonymous Kames would be referred to as ""Sopho"" in the subsequent controversy).  It culminated in an attempt by conservative ministers to get both ""Sopho"" and Hume proscribed and excommunicated by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Kirk in 1755-56 (the attempt failed). Kames wrote several influential books.  For economists, his most notable performance is his conjectural history of civilization, positing the ""four stage theory"".  It was suggested already in Kames's 1732 Essays in Law, in his 1747 Essays in British antiquities, further elaborated in his 1758 Historical Law Tracts, and finally refined and articulated most extensively in his 1774 Sketches on Man.  Kames had entertained a larger projected history, but now in his seventies, limited himself to just the outlines of it.     Starting from hints from Hobbes, Pufendorf and Montesquieu, Kames set out to construct legal history based on property rights.  Kames posited that the ""desire for property"" and ""thirst for opulence"" (rather than pursuit of pleasure per se) was the principal motivator of human behavior.  The lust for property naturally led to conflict between people, prompting communities to develop social norms and conventions to mediate and regulate property rights. Kames posited that law, culture and the moral order of society adapted to cement these norms into an institutional form.  Kames's principal innovation was to suggest that law was not static, that as changes in the underlying economic mode of subsistence brought up new types of property,  new norms would develop, leading to adaptive changes in social institutions.  Economic change causes social change, and thus change in law, culture and morals - in short, that the evolution of the economy drives the evolution of civilization.  Kames conjectured a historical pattern of civilization in four distinct stages - hunter-gatherer society, nomadic-pastoral society, agrarian society and finally commercial society. Kames's four-stage theory was highly influential and picked up by nearly every member of the Scottish Enlightenment.  It can be seen as an inspiration behind David Hume's own theory of evolution of morals and religion (1739, 1757) and the institutional studies in his Essays (1741-42) and his History of England (1754-64).  Kames's four-stage theory is more explicitly articulated in Sir John Dalrymple's History of Feudal Property (1757), in William Robertson's History of Scotland (1759) and more clearly in his History of Charles V (1759); in Adam Smith's Lectures on jurisprudence (1762), and his Wealth of Nations (1776), in Adam Ferguson's History of Civil Society (1767), in John Millar's Origin of Distinction of Ranks (1771) and in James Dunbar's History of Mankind (1780).  It can also be found in Sir James Steuart's Inquiry (1767) It has been posited (e.g. by Meek) that the four-stage theory was simultaneously and independently discovered elsewhere, notably in France by Jacques Turgot (c.1750) and in Naples by Antonio Genovesi, (in 1758).  But there is little doubt that it flourished most clearly in Scotland, and became a defining hallmark of the Scottish Enlightenment.  Although coming relatively late to print, Kames can and should be credited with coming up with it as early as the 1730s, and spreading it among the Edinburgh clique.

Karl Kautsky, 1854-1938.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kautsky.htm," Karl Kautsky has been rightly considered the successor of Engels in the intellectual leadership of the Marxian School. Born in Prague, of a Czech father and German mother, Karl Kautsky got involved with the socialist movement while a student at the University of Vienna, and went on to become a close disciple and collaborator of Friedrich Engels. Karl Kautksy was the founder (with Engels) of the Marxist journal Die Neue Zeit in 1883, and served as its editor until 1917.  A political leader of the Social Democrats in Germany (legalized 1890), Karl Kautsky (with the assistance of Eduard Bernstein)  drafted the party's Marxist-oriented ""Erfurt Program"" of 1891. In his 1892 explanation, Kautsky outlined an underconsumptionist theory of crises, explaining how increasing lower wage shares stultified demand and would lead to chronic overproduction, crippling the future of capitalism.  After Engels's death in 1895, Karl Kautsky took up the orthodox Marxian mantle in responding to challenges both within and without the  Marxian school.   As such, Kautsky was the principal opponent of Eduard Bernstein during the ""revisionist"" debate over the theory of crises (1899). Kautsky was also a protagonist during the Socialist Calculation debate (1907), as well as an arbitrator during the intra-Marxian debate on imperialism. Kautsky's main individual contribution was the extension of Marx's theory to agriculture (1899) - which provoked a sharp response by Otto Bauer.   In his 1901-02 review of Tugan-Baranovsky, Kautsky extended his crisis theory to explain how lack of domestic demand led to the search for foreign markets, an idea later elaborated in Luxemburg's theory of imperialism.  He remained critical of the revisionists in his 1910-11 review of Hilferding, but began to cede ground in his 1914 article on imperialism and by 1927, effectively accepted that crisis was not inevitable. Kautsky was the compiler and editor of Karl Marx's Theories of Surplus Value (1905-10). Kautsky denounced both Germany's aggression in World War I as well as the conduct of Russian Bolshevists after the 1917 Revolution.

Robert Kayll, ?-?,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kayll.htm," Mysterious Mercantilist author from London, about whom nothing is known.  An author, merely identifying himself as ""J.R., Lond."",  published a controversial tract The Trades Increase in 1615.  Historians of economic thought have puzzled over his identification.  Schumpeter assigns it to ""John Roberts"", but Jacob Viner, following Samuel Johnson's Harleian Miscellany, attributes it to Robert Keale (or Kayll).  Economists since have since customarily preferred to attributed it to ""Robert Kayll"". The title of tract refers ironically to the name of the East India Company's great ship that floundered so spectacularly off Bantam in 1613.  The author provides his two cents to the debate on the ideal method of organizing long-distance trade, as had been previously debated so vociferously between Milles and Wheeler.  The author seems to approve the new (1612) joint-stock corporate organization of the EIC (as opposed to other more traditional systems, like the Society of Merchant Adventurers's single-journey stock and the Staple system).  However, the author is also extremely critical of the EIC's trading activities themselves, deploring the EIC's special right to export bullion, railing against the trading restrictions, the company's near-criminal waste of sailors' lives, ships and investors capital, and accusing the EIC of diminishing, rather than improving, England's naval strength overall.  Kayll opens the tract in a charming manner, claiming to have been so shocked by a recent Mercantilist pamphlet, that ""I resolved to go fishing"". And that is when he realized the poor state of English fishing industry - from English ships, sailors and capital being expended in India, while the profitable herring fisheries and trade nearer to home were neglected, and being taken over by the Dutch. The violence of the author's attack prompted the EIC to seek government action to track down the author and put him on trial for treason in the Star Chamber.  But EIC director Dudley Digges preferred to set out a tract publicly refuting the charges of this ""vknowne busie Person"" directly.

Leon H. Keyserling, 1908-1987,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/keyserling.htm," American Institutionalist economist-lawyer and New Deal mandarin. Leon H. Keyserling was educated at Columbia, receiving his B.A. in 1928, obtained a law degree from Harvard in 1931, and returned to study economics at Columbia. Then a prominent Institutionalist stronghold, Keyserling came under the influence of Rexford Tugwell.  While still a graduate student, Keyserling was appointed instructor at Columbia himself.  After the 1933 ascension of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Keyserling abandoned academia and joined the government as an economic consultant to various New Deal agencies and a legislative assistant to powerful New York senator Robert Wagner.  Keyserling reputedly had a hand in drafting several pieces of notable New Deal legislation. Leon H. Keyserling was appointed  by President Henry Truman to the first Council of Economic Advisors, from 1946 to 1953.  Keyserling was under the chairman Edwin G. Nourse until 1949, and the two reportedly clashed repeatedly over policy, with Keyserling pushing more expansionist goals and programs than the more conservative Nourse could stomach.  Nourse eventually resigned in late 1949, and Keyserling took over as chairman. His main economic writings came after this period, when Keyserling was heading non-profit Conference on Economic Progress.

John Maynard Keynes, 1883-1946. ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/keynes.htm,"  British economist John Maynard Keynes is doubtlessly one the most important figures in the entire history of economics.  Keynes revolutionized economics with his classic book, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936).  This is generally regarded as probably the most influential social science treatise of the 20th Century, in that it quickly and permanently changed the way the world looked at the economy and the role of government in society.  No other single book, before or since, has had quite such an impact. Maynard (as he was commonly called) was the eldest son of the Cambridge economist and logician John Neville Keynes. An enormous influence, Keynes's father would remain a touchstone and frequent consultant during Maynard's future life and career. A sickly child, Maynard was raised in a solidly Victorian household in Cambridge.  W.E. Johnson, Henry Sidgwick and Alfred Marshall were frequent visitors to the Keynes' home.   Young Maynard showed an early aptitude for mathematics, and won a scholarship to the prestigious Eton school in 1897, where he quickly shone.  Keynes won numerous prizes at Eton, both in mathematics and classics, while maintaining a highly active participation in the school's committees and clubs.  Keynes's ability to juggle both high degrees of work and high degrees of extra-curricular play, and make it all seem effortless and easy, would be a feature of his life. Maynard enrolled at King's College Cambridge in 1902, which he took to like a fish in water.  In his second term, Keynes was recruited into the ""Apostles"", a secretive, exclusive student conversation society. Through the Apostles, Keynes formed life-long friendships with future literary men Lytton Strachey and Leonard Woolf, and came to know hefty Cambridge philosophers like Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead and G.E. Moore. In his later 1938 memoir, ""My Early Beliefs"", Keynes would credit the influence of the utilitarian Moore in constructing his philosophical and moral outlook, as well as sparking his interest in probability theory.  Keynes was active in other areas - he became a member of the Cambridge Union debating society, eventually rising to the position of president.  The former president, Edwin Montagu, would become Keynes's life-long political mentor. Montagu introduced him to the political Liberal Club and had Keynes actively campaigning for the Liberal Party during the elections of 1906. Keynes may have had political career in mind when he composed a prize essay on Edmund Burke in 1904. Keynes sat for the (Mathematical) Tripos examination in May, 1905, coming out as twelfth wrangler (a middling score, but better than expected, given his ample distractions).  Uncertain what to do next, Keynes began studying economics in the Summer of 1905, under the tutelage of Alfred Marshall, half in mind to complete an economics degree. Nonetheless, wary of being buried at Cambridge, and lured by London friends, John Maynard Keynes decided to join the British civil service.  Keynes undertook the civil service examination in August 1906, but came only second, missing out on the prime spot at the Treasury, and consoling himself with a position at the India Office, under his old political mentor Edwin Montagu. Keynes moved to London in October 1906 to begin work as a junior clerk in the India Office. Although Marshall had provided him the basic economic tools, it was his practical work at the India Office, much of it examining financial reports, that began to nudge Keynes in that direction. Handling large amounts of data led Keynes to direct some thoughts on the stubborn problem of index numbers.  Nonetheless, the light duties allowed Keynes to focus on writing a dissertation on probability theory, a subject brought out by Moore's philosophy.  Gradually finding Whitehall tiresome, Keynes began looking for opportunities to return to Cambridge and resuming the ""student life"".  Although Keynes failed to win a fellowship to a college, in June 1908, Marshall (then in the process of passing his professorial chair to Arthur Cecil Pigou) secured for Keynes a position as an informal lecturer in economics at Cambridge.  Thus, perhaps aptly, Keynes's entry into economics came not out of any prior passion (he still remained attached to philosophy and probability), but simply because he needed a job.   After a term of preparation, Keynes began lecturing in January 1909. Later that year, Keynes was finally elected fellow of King's College, won the Adam Smith Prize (with an essay on index numbers) and published his first major economics article (on the Indian economy).  Keynes's lectured primarily on money and banking, although in 1910 he would also take on the duties of Pigou's principles class.  A tireless and popular lecturer, Keynes was upgraded to Girdlers lecturer at Cambridge in 1911, and by the end of the year was appointed editor of the RES's The Economic Journal, taking over from the retiring Francis Ysidro Edgeworth on December 31, 1911. At this stage, Keynes's economics was largely conventional Marshallian Neoclassicism.  Politically attached to the Liberal Party since his undergraduate days, Keynes was thoroughly orthodox in his ideas and policy positions - the gold standard (initially), the quantity theory, laissez faire, free trade, etc. - even more conservative than Pigou, who was then pushing economics into the socially activist realm via welfare theory.  On the other hand, Keynes was a bit of a novice - disinterested, Keynes had read very little on the topic outside of Marshall's Principles, before he began teaching it.  Keynes's education as an economist really began while editor of the Economic Journal, when he was forced to read the economics papers falling on his desk, and acquiring in that unique way a deeper and wider knowledge of the field.. Around the same time, Keynes found entry into a new social life in London - the ""Bloomsbury Group"", a set of non-conformist and iconoclastic upper class artists, writers and aesthetes that emerged around this time in London.  It had started back in 1905, with weekly dinners hosted by the children of the late Sir Leslie Stephen in their grand home on Gordon Square, to which Thoby Stephen (the eldest) invited fellow Cambridge students (Clive Bell, Lytton Strachey, Leonard Woolf) visiting London.  Although Thoby died tragically in 1906, the Cambridge men continued visiting, and the dinners continued, centered now around the Stephen sisters (novelist Virginia Woolf and painter Veronica Bell), and gradually evolved into a tight-knit intellectual discussion group.  Despite being in London during this early period and on friendly terms with most of them, Keynes was not one of the original members - his entry into the Bloomsbury group only came later, enabled by the painter Duncan Grant,  Keynes's homosexual partner at the time.  In 1909, Keynes had set up Grant with a studio nearby at Fitzroy Square, and was shortly after drafted into the group. Although their personal relationship was fizzling out, Grant cleared the way for Keynes's acceptance. By the time the Bloosmbury group congealed c.1911, Keynes was one of its core members.  The Bloomsbury group in London formed the center of Keynes's private and social life thereafter. With the exception of Gerald Shove (who overlapped both worlds), Keynes kept his Bloomsbury life strictly separate from his professional life as a Cambridge don or Treasury official.  Social/intellectual life in Cambridge was changing anyway, with the arrival of the Fabians and the eclipse of the Apostles.   Much of the male core of Bloomsbury - Keynes, Strachey, Woolf, Desmond McCarthy and E.M. Foster- had been Cambridge Apostles. In a sense, Bloomsbury was something of a Cambridge-in-exile for the old Apostles, and better reproduced the atmosphere Keynes had relished as a student than current Cambridge did.  At the time, Keynes was working on his probability theory.  But he interrupted this to put out his first book, Indian currency and finance (1913).  This was written in a rush to respond to the ""Indian silver scandal"" that had broken out in late 1912.  In a nutshell, the British government in India was in need of making large silver purchases in 1912, but were afraid speculators might raise the price against it; so they avoided the standard channels for official bullion purchases, and had the private banking firm of Samuel Montagu & Co. discretely buy some £5 million of silver on their behalf.  When this was revealed in late 1912, it smelled of corruption, and the British press had a field day - Sir Stanley Samuel, the leading partner at Samuel Montagu & Co. was the elder brother of Herbert Samuel, a cabinet minister in Lord Asquith's Liberal government, who had been implicated earlier that summer in the separate ""Marconi scandal"", and both were cousins of Edwin Montagu at the India Office.  The press tied the scandals together, with anti-Semitic overtones, insinuating a ""Jewish conspiracy"" was afoot in the circles of government and high finance.  Keynes's 1913 book was designed to show the wisdom of the silver purchase scheme and defend the government (and his old mentor).  Keynes's deployed the intimate practical knowledge of financial matters acquired in the India Office years.  The main outcome of the affair is that Keynes was sought out by a grateful Asquith government.  Keynes was appointed to the Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance, which met over the summer of 1913, to consider whether India should convert to a full gold standard. Keynes was against it, and favored maintaining the current gold-silver exchange system.  The commission dragged on until early 1914.  Its report, delivered in March 1914, contained an annex written by Keynes, recommended the establishment of an India state bank (it did not come to be). On August 2, 1914, two days before World War I broke out, at the pleading of his old commission friends, Keynes rushed to London to advise Lloyd George, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on a mounting banking crisis.  The City had gone into a panic and a credit crunch was developing.  Lloyd George was contemplating suspending convertibility, effectively taking Britain off the gold standard, to maintain the Bank of England's gold reserves.  Keynes quickly apprised that the situation was not a genuine crisis, but a temporary panic, brought about by fear that the outbreak of war might bring the international payments system to a sudden stop, and prevent foreign debtors from remitting payments to London banks.  Keynes dissuaded suspension and advised the Chancellor to allow the Bank of England to use its gold reserves to maintain the international payments, while restricting payments internally. Banks caught temporarily short of funds could be bolstered by a government guarantee, and specially-issued Treasury notes.  The advice was largely followed, the panic subsided.  Keynes brief experience as high government advisor whetted his appetite.  Keynes returned to Cambridge for the fall of 1914, but it was largely depleted of students, many of them having enlisted in the British army.  Keynes offered his services to the government, and in January 6, 1915, Keynes took leave of Cambridge and entered the Treasury, to assist with the financing of the British war economy.  His initial post was as assistant to the economic advisor Sir George Paish.  But Lloyd George was losing confidence in Paish.  Not wishing to be tied to a sinking ship, Keynes ditched Paish and made himself independently available, authoring memoranda and working on committees on his own account, and positioning himself as an indispensable expert on inter-allied finance.  After Lloyd George moved on to the ministry of munitions in May 1915, Keynes became particularly close his successor, Reginald McKenna, and by February 1916, Keynes was appointed head of A Division, basically in charge of anything to do with external finance, and had several fingers in other pies.  The external finance question was a vital one - Britain was not only paying for its own huge war effort, but also financially subsidizing the efforts of allies France, Russia, Italy, Belgium and Serbia. As the war dragged on, this became more acute, and British government had to borrow immense sums from private American banks, like J.P. Morgan, to continue.  But satisfying American lenders meant keeping the pound on the gold standard (for exchange rate stability) at all costs.  That meant British industries had to continue exporting as much as possible to bring in gold and foreign exchange and keep the pound from collapsing.  The McKenna-Keynes position brought them into conflict with Lloyd George (now PM) who wanted more and more resources diverted away from domestic industry and towards the war effort, and dismissed concerns about a pound depreciation, confident that the American banks would continue lending out of their own interest.  Keynes annoyed Lloyd George with his opposition to the new military conscription law (instituted May 1916), on the grounds that it hampered the British export industries. It was enough for Lloyd George to personally strike Keynes name out of the honors list in February 1917 (although Keynes eventually got his Companion of Bath honor three months later, when the Treasury refused to recommend any other name).  The external finance question had reached crisis proportions in late 1916, when the US Federal Reserve instructed banks to curtail foreign lending.  At Keynes's urging, the Treasury came up with all sorts of schemes to keep war spending under control, raise new revenues, and lean on Allies to curb their demands.  The pressure was finally relieved when the United States entered the war in April 1917.  This gave the assurance that funding would now be guaranteed - at least in the long-term.  In the short-term, the British had to contend that private Americans savings were being diverted away from London to fund America's own wartime borrowing.  The US Treasury was also unwilling to release government money to fund Britain's debt to Morgan and private banks, preferring to tie them instead to purchases of US goods, like wheat. By the late summer, the foreign funding crisis was renewed.  Keynes undertook his first trip to the United States in early September 1917, to negotiate directly with the US Treasury on the terms for American loans.  He returned to England in late October.  Although the finance emergency was over, difficulties remained for Keynes to attend to - notably the inter-allied partition of funding.  The US had agreed to subsidize the Allies' purchases of American goods, but the rest of their borrowing needs were still sent to London.  Through early 1918, Keynes tried to negotiate with the Americans to take over a greater share of the funding of Allies, without however losing British control of it.  The other item on the agenda, as the war was approaching its close with the armistice of November 11, 1918, was German reparations.  Keynes's Treasury memoranda insisted that reparations demands should be tailored to Germany's capacity to pay.  In January 1919, Keynes went to France as part of the British delegation to the Versailles Peace Conference.  Keynes was the official representative of the British Treasury at Versailles and sat on the Supreme Economic Council as the deputy of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.   His negotiations with German representatives for food relief in early 1919 is captured in his ""Dr. Melchior"" memoir.   Keynes was appalled at the vindictive nature of the peace settlement, and was particularly opposed to the devastating consequences of the heavy reparations payments imposed on Germany.  Exhausted and disgusted, Keynes resigned from the conference and the Treasury on June 7, 1919.  The treaty was signed a few weeks later (June 28), by which time Keynes was already back in England. Keynes promptly set about writing his famous Economic Consequences of the Peace (Dec, 1919), denouncing the Treaty of Versailles.  It became an international best-seller and catapulted his name into the public spotlight.  Keynes condemned the Versailles terms for knocking out the central mast of the continental European economy - Germany being intimately intertwined by trade as both the major customer and supplier of neighboring countries and beyond, her economic ruin would impoverish Europe altogether.  He blamed the ""Carthaginian peace"" on the short-sightedness of the statesmen and delegates at Versailles, and his book is replete with excoriating sketches of their personalities.  He also articulated his worries about the massive war debt overhang of European governments crimping post-war recovery, and urged a ""general bonfire"" of these ""paper shackles"", i.e. the cancellation of inter-Allied debt.  Keynes ended his book with a prophetic warning that if the Allies insist on the impoverishment of Germany, ""vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp"" (p.268)  and ominously anticipates a future European war ""before which the horrors of the late German war will fade into nothing"". Two years later, in his Revision of the Treaty (1922), Keynes crowed that public opinion had finally come around to him, and proposed a new plan to massively reduce German reparations bill (from 138 billion gold marks to 36 billion, to be paid in installments of 1,260 million per year for thirty years, paid principally to France and Belgium).  Keynes again urged both Britain and the US to waive their share of German reparations, and again went on to urge them to unilaterally cancel the debts owed them by other European governments. In the interlude, Keynes finally got around to publishing his Treatise on Probability (1921).  Although it had been practically finished by 1913, Keynes had set it aside during the Indian commission, and then the war intervened, only allowing him to return to it now.  In the treatise, Keynes dismantled the classical theory of probability and launched what has since become known as the ""logical-relationist"" theory of probability, connecting probability to information.   Keynes's work caused something of a stir in philosophical circles.  It aroused the young Cantabrigian logician, Frank P. Ramsey, to outline his own ""subjective"" theory of probability.  In late 1923, Keynes published his Tract on Monetary Reform, the basis of arguing against Britain's return to the gold standard at pre-war levels, predicting that it would unleash a deflationary spiral.  Keynes recommended focusing on stabilizing price inflation instead, and leaving the exchange rate flexible.  The Tract contains Keynes's contribution to the Cambridge cash-balance theory of money, then being developed by other Cambridge economists, Alfred Marshall, Arthur C. Pigou and Dennis H. Robertson.  It was also in a 1923 newspaper article that he first proposed his ""normal backwardation"" theory of hedging and speculation. Throughout the 1920s, Keynes remained active in public policy debates, channeled mainly through his numerous articles in The Nation & Atheneum, a Liberal weekly magazine which he helped purchase in 1923. Keynes appointed his former Cambridge pupil Hubert D. Henderson as editor of the N&A in 1923. Keynes was on the forefront of the battle against returning Britain to the gold standard at pre-war parity levels, which was being advocated by Treasury guru Otto Niemeyer, Cambridge professor Arthur C. Pigou and practically everyone else.  In late 1923, Keynes published his Tract on Monetary Reform to set the economic case against resumption, predicting it would unleash a deflationary spiral and economic contraction.  Denouncing the gold standard as a ""barbarous relic"", Keynes advocated a managed currency, that the Bank of England and the Treasury should focus on stabilizing price levels and employment, and leave the exchange rate flexible. The Tract contains Keynes's contribution to the Cambridge cash-balance theory of money, then being developed by other Cambridge economists, like Alfred Marshall and Dennis H. Robertson.  It was also in a 1923 newspaper article that he first proposed his ""normal backwardation"" theory of hedging and speculation. Keynes testified before the Macmillan Committee of July 1924, restating his argument against resumption.  As the only other witness agreeing with Keynes was Reginald McKenna, then chairman of Midland Bank,  British Treasury officials dismissed it as the ""Keynes-McKenna view"".   Keynes lost the policy battle, and Britain returned to the Gold Standard in April 1925.  Keynes predicted dire consequences (e.g. ""Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill"", 1925).  Sometime during all this, John Maynard Keynes surprised his Bloomsbury friends by abandoning his homosexual past and striking up a relationship with the Russian ballerina Lydia Lopokova.  Keynes ended up marrying Lydia in 1925, apparently much to their chagrin. In the meantime, a new policy front had opened on the question of unemployment.  The sluggish growth of the British economy in the 1920s, with its persistently high unemployment, puzzled economists and policymakers.  Many dismissed it as a temporary difficulty, part of British economy's ""transition to peace"", that would sort itself out eventually.  But as the situation dragged on, in 1924, Liberal political leader David Lloyd George argued it had different causes, that it was more permanent, and proposed the active policy of government investment in public works as the way to deal with unemployment.  Keynes pondered the question (""Does unemployment need a drastic remedy?"", 1924, N&A) and was soon convinced, and wrote several articles in support of Lloyd George's proposal.  Keynes also authored two famous pieces condemning traditional laissez-faire policy as outdated (1925,1926).  Keynes joined the executive committee of the Liberal Industrial Inquiry, which went on to produce a famous ""Yellow Book"" in early 1928, calling for a  ""National Development Program"" of public capital expenditures as employment policy.  The program became the centerpiece of the Liberal Party platform during the elections of 1929.  The ruling Conservative Party countered with the  ""Treasury view"" that public investment would merely raise interest rates and crowd out private investment, thus leading to no permanent improvement in employment.  On the eve of the election in May 1929, Keynes wrote an election pamphlet with Hubert D. Henderson, Can Lloyd George Do It? setting out the economic case for using public works to reduce unemployment.  The pamphlet articulates a primitive version of the multiplier concept, noting that public works also creates ""indirect employment"" and that giving workers wages and purchasing power would ""give a general stimulus to trade"", that ""greater trade activity would make for further trade activity [and] work with a cumulative effect"" (1929: p.25).  However, at this stage, Keynes still had no proper economic answer to the ""Treasury view"" about crowding out, mumbling speculatively that additional savings would be found elsewhere.   In 1929, Keynes also entered into a small debate with Bertil Ohlin and Jacques Rueff on German reparations problem.  Despite being the only party with exciting new ideas, Lloyd George's Liberal Party was defeated in the elections of May, 1929.  The disappointment soured Keynes on the effectiveness of public policy advocacy.  After three straight defeats - Reparations, the Gold Standard, Public Works - Keynes ceased writing as much in the public press, and eventually wrapped up his association with it.  Keynes's Liberal N&A was merged with the Fabian-founded New Statesman in 1931. Although Keynes remained on the board of the New Statesman & Nation, he became less directly involved, allowing the new editor (Kingsley Martin) to gradually shift the magazine further to the left.  The best of Keynes public policy writings of the 1920s were collected in his Essays in Persuasion (1931).   Keynes had concluded that policy was best pushed internally, inside the corridors of power, rather externally in the press.  Keynes was invited to join the Macmillan Committee in late 1929 So, he persuaded the Ramsay MacDonald, the new Labour prime minister, the establish the Economic Advisory Council (EAC) in early 1930, chaired by Keynes, consisting of two economists (himself and G.D.H. Cole), two business men and one union representative.  He persuaded Hubert D. Henderson to join as senior economist at the EAC (the statistician Colin Clark was on its staff). The EAC was supposed to meet once a month with the prime minister to offer economic policy guidance.  Its impact on actual policy was doubtful.  MacDonald entertained the EAC, seeing its function as merely providing political cover from the criticism of economic illiteracy.  Keynes was quickly frustrated with the EAC - Philip Snowden, the chancellor of the exchequer, limited its range of investigation and Keynes discovered that the economists and businessmen had different outlooks and could not come to agreement on advice.  So, later that same year (July, 1930), Keynes persuaded MacDonald to establish the ""Committee of Economists"" as an offshoot of the EAC, consisting entirely of economists, free to brainstorm on policy, hoping they might provide more consistent guidance on the economic recovery.  On his recommendation, H.D. Henderson, A.C. Pigou, Josiah Stamp and Lionel Robbins joined the Committee.  But it turned out the Committee was no better at coming to one mind.  Keynes tried to get the Committee to approve a tariff championed by the Labour Party as a temporary recovery measure, feeling it was low-hanging fruit, but found Robbins adamantly opposed to it.  Although the 32-year-old Robbins was much junior to Keynes, he was not willing to defer to his elder and compromise his free trade principles.  In 1930, John Maynard Keynes brought out his heavy, two-volume Treatise on Money, which effectively set out his Wicksellian theory of the credit cycle.   In it, the rudiments of a liquidity preference theory of interest are laid out and Keynes believed it would be his magnum opus.   His bubble was soon pricked.   Friedrich von Hayek reviewed the Treatise so harshly that Keynes decided to set Sraffa to review (and condemn no less harshly) Hayek's own competing work.  The Keynes-Hayek conflict was but one battle in the Cambridge-L.S.E. war for supremacy in British economics. The Treatise also led to the formation of a reading group, known as ""the Circus"", composed of the young Cambridge economists Richard Kahn, Joan Robinson, Austin Robinson, James Meade and Piero Sraffa.  Kahn dutifully delivered reports of the Circus's discussions to Keynes, who subsequently began revising his ideas.  One resulting criticism of the Treatise was that it failed to provide a theory of the determination of output and employment as a whole -- a particular pertinent question given the increasing amount of unemployment at the time.    The key was provided to Keynes in a short article by Richard  Kahn (1931) -- the theory of the income-expenditure multiplier -- which was to be the basis of his future revolution.  Already in a few 1933 articles and pamphlets, Keynes began announcing the new idea, and began submitting the drafts of his new book to the Circus and several fellow economists for review and dissection.  His ideas on the marginal efficiency of investment took a little longer to work out. In early 1936, the new book finally came out with the pretentious title of  The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.   Heavily anticipated, cheaply priced and propitiously timed for a world caught in the grips of the Great Depression, the General Theory made a splash in both academic and political circles.  As one American politician put it, everyone always knew that the economic policies recommended by the Neoclassical economists were bad policies; but now they realized it was also bad economics. With the General Theory, as it became known, Keynes sought to develop a theory that could explain the determination of aggregate output - and as a consequence, employment. He posited that the determining factor was aggregate demand.  Among the revolutionary concepts initiated by Keynes was the concept of a demand-determined equilibrium wherein unemployment is possible, the ineffectiveness of price flexibility to cure unemployment, a unique theory of money based on ""liquidity preference"", the introduction of radical uncertainty and expectations, the marginal efficiency of investment schedule breaking Say's Law (and thus reversing the savings-investment causation), the possibility of using government fiscal and monetary policy to help eliminate recessions and control economic booms.  Indeed, with this book, he almost single-handedly constructed the fundamental relationships and ideas behind what became known as ""macroeconomics"". The Keynesian Revolution split the economics world in two generations: the young climbed over themselves to line up behind Keynes; the old rallied to condemn it.  John Maynard Keynes responded to his most able critics -- Jacob Viner, Dennis Robertson and Bertil Ohlin -- in a series of 1937 articles, which helped him to expand upon some key aspects of his theory. A densely-written and difficult book, it was followed up immediately by elucidatory publications by the members of Keynes's Circus, such as Joan Robinson, and young economists elsewhere in Britain, such as Roy Harrod and Abba Lerner.   Of particular importance was the 1937 article by John Hicks which introduced the ""IS-LM"" representation of Keynes's theory that launched the ""Neoclassical-Keynesian Synthesis"" that was to pervade in America (and elsewhere) as the dominant form of macroeconomics in the post-war era, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s.  However, the so-called ""Cambridge Keynesians"" -- which included veterans of Keynes's Circus -- and their American cousins, the Post-Keynesian school, would dispute the ""Synthesis"" twist on the Keynesian Revolution.  They posited up their own versions of the theory, which, they argued, was more faithful to Keynes's original message. Keynes's health collapsed circa 1938, and, consequently, Keynes largely missed out participating in the debate which was then raging on the interpretation of his own grand work.  When World War II broke out in earnest, Keynes re-emerged and published his 1940 pamphlet, How to Pay for the War.  In that small tract, he identified the ""inflationary gap"" created by resource constraints during the war effort, and promoted the device of ""compulsory saving"" and rationing to prevent price inflation, proposals that were adopted in 1941.  The 1940 piece is notable for it provided the seeds of a theory of inflation to complement the ""depression economics"" of the General Theory. During the course of the war, Keynes was at the Treasury and set himself to think about the post-war economic order.   In 1938, Keynes had warmed up to Benjamin Graham's proposals for an international ""commodity-reserve"" currency to replace the defunct Gold Standard.  In 1943, Keynes forged his ideas for ""Bancor"", a proposal for an international clearing union.    In consultation with the Americans, Keynes eventually relented on his idea and accepted the American ""White Plan"" for an international equalization ""fund"" held in the currencies of the participating nations.  However, several essential aspects of Keynes's clearing union idea were incorporated. In 1944, Keynes led the British delegation to the international conference in Bretton Woods where the details of the system were hammered out.  The American ""White Plan"" was accepted, countries would retain fixed exchange rates against the dollar, while the dollar itself would be matched to gold.  Two institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (IBRD), were created to oversee the new international monetary system.    All these exhausting official missions and work taxed Keynes's already precarious health.  The ailing Keynes undertook one last strenuous journey to America on behalf of the Attlee Labour government in September 1945, to negotiate a $5 billion American grant to war-torn Great Britain.  But Keynes met resistance from American officials, and only managed to arrange a guarantee of an American loan of $3.75 billion, but with 2% interest strings attached on trade concessions. He returned to England by sea (his heart unable to withstand the conditions of a return flight) to push for the ratification of the loan's terms by the British parliament. Keynes died on April 22, 1946, two months before the loan was ratified by Congress.

John Neville Keynes, 1852-1949.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/nevillekeynes.htm," Cambridge logician and economist, best known as the father of John Maynard Keynes.  John Neville Keynes was the delicate only son in a wealthy Salisbury manufacturing family.  His father, John Keynes, had inherited a brush-making business, which he soon abandoned to his brother, concentrating on horticulture instead.  A non-conformist (Congregationalist) family, Neville Keynes' education was pursued at local schools and Amersham Hall, a dissenting academy.  Despite a nervous constitution and anxious disposition, which apparently marred his performance in examinations and much of his career, Keynes managed to win the Gilchrist Scholarship in 1869 at University College London and, a few years later, a mathematical scholarship to Pembroke College, Cambridge.  But he didn't stay with mathematics, and switched to the Moral Science Tripos soon after, showing a particularly affinity for logic. It was around this time that he came under the influence of Alfred Marshall. Uncertain about his career prospects, Neville Keynes insured himself by completing degrees at both UCL and Cambridge, and, in 1876, was simultaneously elected a Fellow of both Pembroke College and UCL. Tutoring Cambridge students in both logic and political economy, his old teacher, Alfred Marshall, tried to steer him in the direction of economics and encouraged him to compete for the Cobden prize. But having failed that, and with Marshall gone in 1877, Keynes concentrated on tutoring in logic, leaving political economy to Herbert Foxwell.  In 1880, Keynes got engaged to a Newnham college student, Florence Ada Brown, endangering his Pembroke fellowship (Cambridge fellowships were then reserved for bachelors).  One possibility urged upon him was to apply for Jevons's vacant chair at UCL in 1880, but the anxious Keynes declined, preferring to stay in Cambridge rather than move to London.  So, in 1882, Keynes took up an administrative job with Cambridge's Local Examinations Syndicate (a job he would hold until 1910) and married Florence.  His first son, John Maynard, was born a year later. In 1884, Keynes published his Studies and Exercises in Formal Logic, based on his lessons.  Its pedagogic clarity was a hit with students and went through several editions.  That same year, he was appointed Cambridge University Lecturer in Moral Sciences (a post he held until 1911). At the end of 1884, Alfred Marshall, then at Oxford teaching economics to Indian civil service students, was appointed as professor of Political Economy at Cambridge and persuaded Neville Keynes to fill in for his teaching duties at Oxford.  Marshall also attempted, more strenuously (and with the connivance of Florence), to get Neville Keynes to secure a permanent appointment  at Oxford.  Keynes agreed to teach for one day at week at Oxford, but refused anything more permanent, and declined to submit his candidacy for the Oxford Drummond chair in 1888. Nonetheless, his Oxford experience led to John Neville Keynes's re-encounter with economics, and in 1891, he produced his most famous tract, The Scope and Method of Political Economy (1891).  It was a masterpiece of compromise: Keynes attempted to reconcile the historical and theoretical approaches, the Classical and Neoclassical schools.  In this manner, Keynes set out the methodological approach of the Marshallian school. Keynes wrote the entry on W. Stanley Jevons in Encyclopaedia Brittanica.

Ibn Khaldun, 1332-1406,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/khaldun.htm," Medieval Arab 14th C. historian and social philosopher.  Ibn Khaldun (or Ibn Khaldoun) was arguably the first ""social scientist"" in the strictest meaning of that term.  Ibn Khaldun was born in Tunis (then part of Hafsid Ifriqiya).  His family was of Yemenite Arab origin, and had previously lived for generations in the Andalusian citadel of Seville. Like many other Andalusian Arabs, they had left during the Reconquista and re-established themselves in North Africa. 'In his early life, Ibn Khaldun took on a variety of government posts in Ifriqiya (Tunsia), Fez (Morocco), Granada (Spain) and Biaja (Algeria).  War and political intrigue eventually led him to search for the quiet of  exile in Qalat Ibn Salama, a North African fortress village in 1374.  It was here that he began writing his Kitab al-I'bar, or ""universal history"", which would occupy him for the next few decades. Ibn Khaldun finally settled in Egypt in 1382, where he served as the chief Malakite judge and lectured at the Al-Azhar University in Cairo.  In 1400, he was sent to Damascus to negotiate the capitulation of that city to the conquering Tatars.  It was there had he had his famous encounter with their leader, Tamerlane.  Ibn Khaldun is best known for his monumental Muqaddimah (1377), the first volume and ""prolegomena"" to what eventually became his seven-volume historical treatise.  Therein, he develops a systematic theory of historical political and economic organization.  Rejecting mythical and religious explanations for the origins and laws of human society, Ibn Khaldun adopted, perhaps for the first time, the methodology of the social sciences.   Ibn Khaldun anticipates many of the elements of the political theory of Thomas Hobbes.  ""Aggressiveness is in the nature of every living creature"", Ibn Khaldun claimed.  As a single man was physically unequipped to battle beasts and tame nature, cooperation among humans was necessary.  This cooperation or what he called ""group-feeling"" -- strongest among blood relatives --  formed at the foundation of society.   But with the advance of civilization, via agriculture and settlement, there is relief from the fight against nature and so, gradually, the need for cooperation becomes less urgent,  group-feeling dissolves and the natural aggressiveness of men re-emerges, this time directed against other men and their property.  As a result, ""People need someone to exercise a restraining influence to keep them apart, for aggressiveness and injustice  are in the animal nature of man."" (Khaldun, 1377: p.47) and this device was ""royal authority"" (ibid.), the promulgator and enforcer of laws.  ""People as a rule covet the possessions of other people.  Without the restraining influence of the laws, nobody's property would be safe."" (1377: p.313)).   But who restrains the royal?  Group-feeling, once again.  A tyrant can rule by force alone, but not for very long.  For, once he becomes a tyrant, sets the conditions for the arousal of group-feeling in society against him.  A good part of the Muqaddimah is dedicated to advising princes how to avoid such an outcome.  Among these are numerous cautions on economic matters.   His consideration of the delicate interface between government and private enterprise is rather prescient of the ""modern"" attitude towards economic policy which only really began in Europe after the 18th Century Enlightenment.   Ibn Khaldun introduced an archaic labor theory of value, believing labor to be a necessary and sufficient condition for value -- ""gains and profits, in their entirety or for the most part, are value realized from human labour"" (Khaldun, 1377: p.298).  Although deploring merchants for their ""unmanly"" character, Khaldun regarded commerce and the search for profit -- the activity of merchants -- as a ""natural way to make a living"", at least one consistent with the animal propensities of men.  He recognized the importance of private enterprise in determining the economic welfare of a nation, ""Civilization and its well-being as well as business prosperity depend on productivity and people's efforts in all directions in their own interest and profit."" (1377: 238).  As a result, a prince needs to pay attention to private incentives when making economic policy decisions.   Ibn Khaldun recognized that a prince needs money to rule -- to win allies, corrupt rivals, maintain an army, build fortifications, etc. -- but the question of how to acquire revenue must be approached very carefully.  In a famous passage employing the logic of ""supply-side"" economics, Ibn Khaldun warned rulers not to hamper or engage in commerce themselves as, by twisting the incentives of private enterprise, it is ""harmful to his subjects and ruinous to the tax revenue"" (1377: p.232). Tax revenue, Ibn Khaldun claims, ""can be improved only through the equitable treatment of people with property and regard for them, so that their hopes rise, and they have the incentive to start making their capital bear fruit and grow."" (1377: p.234).  He condemned price-fixing as ""even more dangerous, harmful and ruinous for the subjects."" (ibid.) than direct government competition.   However, the most probable outcome for a king's fall from grace is not an uprising by his own people against tyranny or impoverishment via economic overreach, but rather invasion by outsiders.  In a state of war between nations, a tyrant will hardly be able to raise an effective army among the people he rules and thus his defenses are inevitably weak, regardless of how much money he expends on them.  He makes the observation that, historically, sedentary populations usually fall to invasions by poor nomadic or barbarian tribes.  This is because the harsh way of life of nomadic peoples naturally generates a very intense group-feeling, which, when applied in aggression, turns them into an extraordinarily powerful, united and determined fighting force.   On the whole, despite his recommendations for good rule, Ibn Khaldun was pessimistic about the lasting power of kingdoms. Eventually, drunk on power and forgetful of the past, there will be some royal down the line who will be tempted to tyranny, thereby setting the stage for being overthrown from within or without.   It is unlikely, he claimed, that a dynasty will last more than three or four generations.        Major Works of Ibn Khaldun     Resources on Ibn Khaldun All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Charles P. Kindleberger, 1910-2003,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kindleberger.htm,"American monetary and trade economist and economic historian at M.I.T. Charles Poor Kindleberger originated from a patrician family in New York. He studied as an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, receiving his B.A. in 1932, and subsequently received his Ph.D. from Columbia during its Institutionalist heyday, in 1937 under J.W. Angell..  Kindleberger started his career in the Federal Reserve system, initially at the FRB in New York (1934-1939) then, with a year's interruption at the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, at the  Federal Reserve Board in Washington DC (1940-42).  During World War II, Kindleberger worked at the Office of Strategic Services (ancestral to the CIA), both in Washington and abroad (London, and with the US army in Europe).  After the war, Kindleberger remained with the US government, at the State Department, working on issues related to European reconstruction.. In 1948, Kindleberger left government service and moved into academia, joining the faculty at M.I.T where he would remain for the remainder of his career. From his earliest days at the Fed, Kindleberger carved out a corner as a foremost expert on international conomics, with numerous works on foreign exchange markets, international capital flows, trade multipliers.  Kindleberger authored a highly-successful textbook, International Economics (1953), going through multiple editions, which would remain standard in the field for many decades. Later works take on a  more historical tone, with examinations of the experience of European reconstruction, and monetary and financial history.  Kindleberger is perhaps best known for his popular Manias, Panics and Crashes, which continues to be reprinted with much relevance every few years.      Major Works of Charles P.

Gregory King, 1648-1712,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/king.htm,"English 17th C. political arithmetician Gregory King was a surveyor, mapmaker and herald of Lancaster. King's 1695 survey of taxes and their geographical and demographic distribution in Great Britain include some of the first proper estimates of population in Great Britain.  But it is King's 1696 manuscript, Natural and Political Observations, that is justly celebrated.  It is a comprehensive examination of family income and expenditure, greatly expanding upon and correcting Petty's original estimates of the income and wealth of the UK.  It also contains the comparisons of the statistics with Holland and France. Gregory King's works remained unpublished until George Chalmers unearthed his 1696 manuscript and published it as an appendix to his own 1802 Estimate of the Comparative Strength of Great Britain.   Nonetheless, back in the 1690s, King's friend, Charles D'Avenant. had access to his work and used King's figures throughout his own work.  Most famously, D'Avenant credits King for the source of the data on the relationship between price of wheat and defect in the harvest by which D'Avenant.(1699) famously constructs what can be regarded as the first econometric estimation of a demand curve.  However, the original source in King's work has not been found and some consider the estimate to be D'Avenant's own.  (see King-Davenant Law).

Born in Dundee, Scotland, to a working class family, David Kinley immigrated with his parents to America in 1872, settling in Andover, Massachusetts.  He eventually attended Phillips Academy and Yale University on a scholarship, although it had to be interrupted for health reasons, but Kinley eventually collected his B.A. in 1884.  After serving as a high school teacher in North Andover for six years, Kinley enrolled in the graduate program at the Johns Hopkins University in 1890 to study under Richard T. Ely.  In 1892,  Kinley followed Ely to the University of Wisconsin.  He took on a large teaching role there while finishing up his graduate studies. After acquiring his Ph.D. from Wisconsin in 1893, Kinley joined the faculty of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Kinley took an active role in the development of economics and graduate studies more generally at Illinois.  He was university president from 1920 to 1930.  A specialist in money and banking, David Kinley is perhaps best known for his opposition to the simple ""Quantity Theory"" and his attempts to create a more ""marginalist"" theory of money, along the lines of the encaisse desiree.

Georg F. Knapp, 1842-1926.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/knapp.htm," A heavy-working empiricist of the German Historical School.  After studying at Munich and Berlin, Knapp obtained his doctorate in Göttingen in 1865, in an empirical study of von Thünen's theory of wages.  Knapp was appointed to the statistical research bureau of Prussian Saxony, and lectured on statistics at the local university of Leipzig from 1869.  Knapp moved west to become professor of economics at the University of Strasbourg in 1872, which had just been transformed from a French to a German university.  Knapp and his colleague Gustav Schmoller formed the kernel of the ""younger generation"" of the German Historical School at Strasbourg. Georg Friedrich Knapp applied his statistical tools to many historical and demographic studies of economic arrangements. His work on agricultural systems (1891) and money (1905) are perhaps best known.  Knapp was the champion of the ""Chartalist"" theory of money, i.e. that the value of money is not due to its inherent commodity value, nor even custom, but rather anchored artificially by State acceptance of the payment of taxes in that currency. After the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, Knapp retired from Strasbourg.      Major Works of G.F. Knapp     Resources on G.F. Knapp   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Karl Knies, 1821-1898.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/knies.htm,"  Karl Gustav Adolf Knies (sometimes spelled Carl Knies) was one of the leading members of the ""older generation"" of the German Historical School.  Karl Knies was educated the University of Marburg, graduating in 1846 with a thesis on ancient Roman history, and stayed on as a lecturer, often filling in for Bruno Hildebrand.  Knies was involved in the planning of a Polytechnic School in Cassel, but political denouements after 1848 led to his temporary exile.  Knies spent sometime teaching at the high school of Shaffhausen (Switzerland), before returning to Germany in 1855, taking up the professorship of cameralistics at the University of Freiburg in Baden.  In 1865, Karl Knies moved to the University of Heidelberg, succeeding Karl Heinrich Rau. in that prestigious professorial chair. Knies would remain at Heidelberg for the rest of his career. In his famous 1846 thesis at Marburg, elaborated in his 1853 book, Karl Knies posited a ""linear stages"" theory, which spoke of ""moral progress"" which would render most theories obsolete.   Knies argued that economics straddled the interface between natural forces (Naturwissenschaften) and human action (Geisteswissenschaften).  Contrary to Roscher's aspirations, Knies argued that economic ""laws"" cannot be treated in terms of natural science given the preponderance of the irrational and the subjective in human action (which guides the economy).  Consequently, the so-called ""laws"" of economics are merely ""laws of analogy"".  The historicist method, Knies argued, is the only one available to elucidate this.   Knies's defense of the historical methodology on logical (as opposed to empirical) grounds was severely criticized by Schmoller and Weber. Knies was a relentless critic of Classical economics and a strident opponent of Socialist movements.  In his 1857 work, he was perhaps the first to examine the economic role of commercial ""advertisements"". His 1873 work on money and credit, however, contained little of the historical method in it.   After teaching for a while at Freiburg, Karl Knies became a professor at the University of Heidelberg in 1865, where he would remain until his death.  Numerous young American economists, such as John Bates Clark, E.R.A. Seligman, Richard T. Ely, Herbert Baxter Adams, and Andrew Dexter White, studied under Knies at Heidelberg and regarded him as their ""master"".  Interestingly, both Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and Friedrich von Wieser, who would later form the vanguard of the Austrian School, were briefly students of Knies in 1875. Karl Knies retired in 1896.  His chair at Heidelberg was inherited by the young Max Weber.      Major Works of Karl Knies     Resources on Karl Knies   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Frank H. Knight,1885-1972.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/knight.htm," The ""Grand Old Man"" of Chicago, Frank H. Knight was one of the century's most eclectic economists and perhaps the deepest thinker and scholar American economics has produced.  Jointly with Jacob Viner, Knight presided over the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago from the 1920s to the late 1940s,  and played a central role in setting the character of that department that was perhaps only comparable to Schumpeter's tenure over Harvard or Robbins's at the L.S.E. Originating from rural Illinois, Frank H. Knight was educated at Milligan College and the University of Tennessee, and went on for graduate study in philosophy at Cornell University, where he switched to economics and received his Ph.D.  in 1916, under Alvin S. Johnson and Allyn Young (one of Knight's main influences, Herber J. Davenport, only arrived at Cornell that year).  After a brief period as instructor at Cornell and Chicago, Frank H. Knight joined the faculty at the University of Iowa in 1919 and became a professor at the University of  Chicago  in 1927, where he would remain until his death  in 1972 Frank H. Knights's famous dissertation Risk, Uncertainty and Profit (1921) remains one of the most interesting reads in economics even today. In it, Knight made his famous distinction between ""risk"" (randomness with knowable probabilities) and ""uncertainty"" (randomness with unknowable probabilities), set forth the role of the entrepreneur in a distinctive theory of profit and gave one of the earliest presentations of the the now-famous law of variable proportions in the theory of production. While irreducibly Neoclassical in a general sense, Knight's peculiar economics were a direct inheritance of his Cornell professor, Herbert J. Davenport and what was then called the ""American Psychological School"" which sought to ground the Marginalist high theory of Jevons, Wicksteed and the Austrians in the relativist foundations of Thorstein Veblen's methodology. Like Davenport, the notoriously belligerent Knight criticized other schools on several accounts while also adopting some of their ideas: for instance, from the Walrasians he adopted the idea of theoretical rigor and viewing the economy in terms of multiple markets, but disparaged their mathematical propensities; from the Austrians he adopted their theory of alternative cost, but attacked their theory of capital; from the Marshallians he adopted their literary tone, but attacked their lack of rigor and their ""real"" theory of cost; from the Ricardians, he adopted a concern with the interaction between social structure and theory but attacked the objectivist basis of their theory; from the Marxians, he adopted many of their ideas about the ethical critique of capitalism as well as its tendency towards the concentration of capital, but he abhorred the labor theory of value; from the Institutionalists, he adopted their concern with social impact on behavior and evolution, but he opposed their empirical techniques and conclusions (""history is to be sensed, not plotted"", as Knight put it).   The famously opinionated Knight used his numerous book reviews in Chicago's Journal of Political Economy as a vehicle for his thoughts on many subjects. As a result, he was embroiled in many debates with the most prominent economists of his day ranging over capital theory (versus Hayek, Mises and the Austrians, e.g. 1933, 1935, 1937),  welfare theory (versus Pigou, e.g. 1924),  Keynesian theory (1937) and positivist methodology (versus Hutchison (1940)). Thus, Knight amalgamated much of what was contained all over the spectrum of economic theory - but without once losing the skeptic's dissecting eye. Perhaps because he was endowed with enough of the demeanour and knowledge of a philosopher, sociologist and historian as well as an economist, he was able to appear as a kindred spirit to all schools as well as an opponent at the same time. As noted, Knight was one of the leaders of the inter-war  ""Chicago School"" (although we must keep in mind that during his stay there, the Chicago School had a much different tone than it acquired later).   Yet, even then, he managed to remain an outsider in his own kingdom.  Knight's well-known dislike of quantitative methods and especially empirical techniques brought him into conflict with several colleagues - notably, Henry Schultz, Paul Douglas and Oskar Lange. His opposition to the Marshallian propensities of his co-giant, Jacob Viner, earned him the latter's respect but not necessarily his  friendship. Even Knight's own unlikely protegé Henry Simons, differed substantially from Knight on most matters. Like Schumpeter (whom he both admired and resembled in many ways), Knight was an avid proponent of a cosmopolitan laissez-faire -- but he did so on unique, ""non-consequentialist"" grounds. As is evident in his famous ""Ethics of Competition"" (1923) and in other works on ethics throughout his life, Knight does not regard the capitalist system as ethically defensible. Capitalism, he claims, does not produce what people want but merely creates the wants for what it produces - ""the freest individual...is in large measure a product of the economic environment that has formed his desires and needs, given him whatever marketable productive capacities he has, and which largely controls his opportunities."" (Knight, 1923). Furthermore, he argued that there was a tendency in market systems towards monopoly, that the ""efficiency"" of markets was misleading for there was no sense of ""usefulness"" of its output to society, that the marginal productivity thesis had erroneous ethical implications as ""the income does not go to ""factors"" but to their owners...and ownership of personal or material productive capacity is based upon a complex mixture of inheritance, luck and effort, probably in that order of relative importance"" (Knight, 1923). Knight's peculiar ethical assault on the market system and ""apologetic economics"" did not diminish his penchant for laissez-faire as a policy conclusion. The economy, he argued, is a very complex and unstable thing. Programs of government intervention are too simplistic and do not take into account the complexities of a market economy - thus making interventionism even more dangerous. Laissez-faire is recommended, he argued, not because it ""works"" (for it patently does not) but rather because it holds individual freedom as a absolute good and the alternative may be much worse.   As a result, Knight's position is quite the reverse of the  Second Chicago School economists of the 1960s, (i.e. Friedman, Stigler and company). The Second Chicago School tended to argue the positivist line that  laissez-faire is desirable because it delivers the goods, and not because it is a good in itself.  Indeed, throughout his life, Knight explicitly deplored and attacked many of the assumptions that the Second Chicago School held dear: e.g. the denial of the importance of monopolistic competition, the assumption of consumer sovereignty, stable preferences, efficient outcomes of markets, empirical-intuitive reasoning, interdisciplinary imperialism, etc.   All these items are precisely and directly opposed to virtually every important argument and position of Knight's.   Indeed, the later Chicago School's declared ""positivist"" methodology was wryly characterized by Knight as ""the emotional pronouncement of value judgements condemning emotion and value judgements which seems to [me] a symptom of a defective sense of humor"" (Knight, 1940).  However, we must grant that Knight's theories of capital (Knight viewed all factors as capital to a greater or lesser degree) and his ""public choice"" view of political behavior could be said to have persisted in at least some quarters of the modern Chicago School. In this sense, then, Knight, like Schumpeter, carved a unique path in economics -- being claimed by many schools of thought as one of their own, without really belonging to any.  Unfortunately, also like Schumpeter, although he educated and influenced many students, Knight failed to acquire any followers and failed to build up a distinctive ""school of thought"" around himself.   We can see some traces of his perspective in the work of Kenneth E. Boulding, Martin Bronfenbrenner, James M. Buchanan and George J. Stigler, but they can hardly be called ""Knightians"" in any meaningful sense.         Major Works of Frank H. Knight     Resources on F.H.Knight   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Nikolai D. Kondratiev, 1892-1931,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kondratiev.htm," The Soviet Russian economist, Nikolai Kondratiev (or Kondratieff), well-known for his contributions to business cycle empirics.  Nikolai Dmitrievich Kondratiev war born in Kostroma, to a peasant family, but went on to become a student of Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky at the University of St. Petersburg, where Kondratiev stayed on to teach.  Kondratiev became caught up in politics, and joined the  Social Revolutionary Party (SRs).  He was appointed deputy minister for food supply in the last Kerensky government in 1917.  Although initially collaborating with the Bolsheviks after the October 1917 revolution, Kondratiev was briefly arrested in 1918 for opposing their food policies. In 1919, Kondratiev moved to Moscow to teach at the Petrovskaya Agricultural Academy (now Moscow State Agricultural University), becoming full professor by 1923.  In 1920, Kondratiev founded and headed the Moscow Institute for Business Conditions (or ""Conjucture Insittute"").  Its initial work was dedicated to developing statistics and indicators for agricultural conditions. Kondratiev's principal claim to fame is his identification (1925) of half-century fluctuations or ""long waves"" of 45 to 60 years - what would later be called ""Kondratiev Cycles"".  The sketch of Kondratiev's theory was first published in Russian in 1922, but his main theory was worked out in a substantial 1925 article for the Institute's journal, and followed up in a 1928 volume.  Kondratiev's work only became widely known when a German translation was was published in 1926 (partially translated to English only in 1935). In his 1925 paper, Kondratiev examined commodity price indexes for Britain, France and the United States from the late 18th C. through 1920.  He identified three cyclical waves.  Kondratiev's first cycle began  from 1789 continued until its turning point in 1814 (peak) then declined until 1849 (trough).  The second cycle rose from there, hitting its turning point in 1873 (peak) then declined until 1896 (trough).  Kondratiev then conjectured the world was still in the middle of third cycle that began in 1896 and that 1920 was probably its peak turning point.   While Kondratiev's focus was on prices series, he argued that real economic activity followed the same path   To get the latter, Kondratiev constructed moving averages of detrended per capita series on wages, foreign trade and bond prices (basing himself partly on the techniques of Warren M. Persons).   Kondratiev did not limit himself to empirics, but also offered a theoretical explanation for the long cycle. He saw technological innovation and financial accumulation driving periodic great waves of capital investment.  During a downswing, there is little capital investment and existing capital goods are allowed to depreciate without replacement.  But Kondratiev proposed that pressures on profits during downswings led entrepreneurs to scramble for cost-cutting inventions and also to increased concentration of capital.  So, at the bottom of the cycle, as capital depreciation reaches its nadir, businesses have portfolios of new inventions waiting to be applied and large, accumulated liquid funds ready to finance them.  This, Kondratiev conjectured, would kick off a wave of implementation and the build-up of long-term capital projects (like canals, railroads and factories).  The upswing is thus characterized by innovation (rather than invention), and the dissipation of capital by large scale investment.  Kondratiev proposed that the large-scale changes in production techniques during the capital-building upswing would cause social upheaval, which would likely become increasingly violent, draw political attention and might even lead to wars.   In the end end, the rising cost of capital, lack of new inventions, saturation of profitable investment opportunities and social-political stresses would begin chipping away at profits and slow down the boom, culminating in a major crisis that turned the long boom into a long recession.  Then the process starts again -   inventions and accumulation in the downswings for the next twenty or so years, which would eventually feed into the innovation and financing of the upswing thereafter. Kondratiev's theory was received with great skepticism.  Eugen Slutsky (who had joined the Conjucture Institute in 1926) criticized the method, famously showing that the moving average of a series of random numbers can exhibit cyclical patterns. But there were also serious objections to Kondratiev's assumption of the coincidence of price series and real activity. Lack of data at the time meant Kondratiev had to use short-cuts and proxies for real activity.  But empirical evidence collected since shows clearly there are long stretches of time when prices and production moved in opposite directions, thus kicking out one of the pillars Kondratiev's theory rested on.  Others pointed out that Kondratiev's long cycles are too few to confirm or disconfirm. Others note their timing coincides with big exogenous events - wars, gold rushes, imperialism - which can be (and have been) used by themselves to explain the apparent turning points and drive the swings (although Kondratiev acknowledged these big events, he insisted they were endogenous).   From the Marxist left, Kondratiev was attacked by Leon Trotsky, who had independently developed (in 1921)  his own theory of long-term capitalist crisis in terms of stages rather than cycles.  For Trotsky, capitalism did not move in waves, but was heading relentlessly towards a final crisis and complete breakdown.  To Trotsky (and other left critics), Kondratiev seemed to be suggesting that the capitalist system was, on the whole, stable, that it survived cyclical crisis without fundamental transformation. Trotsky's own theory interpreted the various apparently cyclical phases as mere adaptations of capitalism to crisis events in the ""superstructure"" - in short, that the wave pattern was exogenously driven.  Trotsky  criticized Kondratiev for assuming that the crises were periodic, for ignoring or endogenizing the superstructure,  and for insisting that cyclical patterns were inherent in the capitalist system.   The Kondratiev-Trotsky controversy brought his career to an end.  It had been going well before.  Although Kondratiev was not a Bolshevik, his quantitative skills were sought out in 1923 to develop a five year plan for Russian agriculture.  He cooperated with Bukharin and his group in the early years of the Soviet planning, and was a strong supporter of the New Economic Policy (NEP) during its heyday. But his acrimonious debate with Trotsky did him no favors - his apparent defense of the ""stability"" of capitalism put him suspiciously in line with revisionist thinkers. After the NEP was scrapped, Kondratiev fell with it - he was dismissed from the Moscow Institute in 1928 and his works were proscribed.  Two years later, in July 1930, Kondratiev was arrested on Stalin's orders, and sentenced  to eight years in a prison camp near Suzdal.  Although the exact fate of Kondratiev was long unknown (old books assume he had died in 1931 or thereabouts), evidence has since surfaced that he survived.  Tragically, just as his sentence was about to end, Kondratiev was executed by firing squad in September 1938. Long cycles have never been quite accepted by mainstream economics and remain suspiciously tinged as a fringe theory attractive to outside cranks and the popular press. Nonetheless, despite the skepticism, Kondratiev was elected a fellow of the Econometric Society in 1933 (Kondratiev was already in prison by that point).   Kondratiev's ideas were famously picked up and modified by Joseph Schumpeter in 1939 (who bestowed the name ""Kondratiev cycle"" on the long wave).  This led to another round of debate over the existence of long waves in the 1940s.  Other economists like W.C. Mitchell, Johan Åkerman, Jan Tinbergen and W.W. Rostow have entertained long-wave empirics (but used other explanations for it).  On the left, the long wave debate was buried after Kondratiev was proscribed in the Soviet Union.  But in the 1970s several Neo-Marxian economists - notably Ernest Mandel and David Gordon - dusted of Kondratiev's theory and tried to make it compatible with Trostky's theory of capitalist crisis. Kondratiev's reputation has improved greatly since his formal rehabilitation by the Soviet government in 1987 and the discovery of new works he had written while in prison. These, along with new translations, were published in four monumental volumes in 1998.      Major Works of Nikolai Kondratiev     Resources on Nikolai Kondratiev   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Tjalling C. Koopmans, 1910-1985. ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/koopmans.htm,"  The Dutch-born Tjalling Koopmans was a pioneer in the development of mathematical economics and econometrics.  As head of the Cowles Commission from 1948 until 1967, Koopmans presided over a crucial period in the development of Neo-Walrasian economics from its roots in the Lausanne School into its modern axiomatized form. His specific contributions were many: Koopmans independently discovered and developed the method of ""linear programming"" and activity analysis and applied it to practical and theoretical general equilibrium models (1951, 1957). His Three Essays (1957) are a classical theoretical and methodological exposition of Neo-Walrasian general equilibrium theory. The equivalence of  ""technical efficiency in production"" and ""profit-maximization"" was forwarded by Koopmans (1951) -- thus leading to his effective involvement in Socialist Calculation debate.  His concern with efficiency in a G.E. setting led him to rewrite the Neoclassical growth model as intertemporal optimization problems (1965, 1967) and his concern with optimality over time have been an important phase of his work.   Koopmans was also instrumental in developing and popularizing the ""Cowles Approach"" to econometrics (1937, 1947, 1950) - or simply econometrics ""as we knew it"" before the time-series/VAR approach became popular. In the 1940s, Koopmans became involved in a Methodenstreit with the American Institutionalists  over their ""measurement without theory"" approach to empirical research. Koopmans was teaching at Yale when he shared the Nobel Memoiral Prize in 1975 with Leonid Kantorovich.      Major works of Tjalling C. Koopmans   Resources on T.C.

Janos Kornai, 1928- ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kornai.htm," Hungarian planning economist.  Between the 1960s and 1980s, János Kornai was perhaps one of the best-known economists of the Eastern bloc. János Kornai (born János Kornahuser) was the son of a well-to-do Hungarian bourgeois family, whose destiny got derailed during the Nazi occupation of Hungary.  Kornai's family was interned in a camp for a period (his father shipped off to slave labor, later to be killed at Auschwitz).  Kornai's sympathies turned naturally towards his Soviet liberators, and he resolved to learn more about Marxism, and set about studying it on his own.  Finding Marx an eye-opener,  Kornai joined the Hungarian Communist Party and became a vigorous activist.  For a decade after the war, Kornai worked as an economic columnist for the party newspaper, Szabad Nep. In 1955,  his faith shaken by some of the grimmer realities of communist Hungary, Janos Kornai left the newspaper and enrolled in the Institute of Economics at the Hungarian Academy of Science in Budapest.  He would remain associated with this institution for decades, as teacher, researcher and eventually, from 1967, director. Kornai's 1957 thesis was one of the first books detailing the problems of socialist central planning.  Kornai helped introduce modern mathematical programming methods in socialist planning in the 1960s, most famously the ""two-level"" planning (Kornai-Liptak), decomposing a large linear programming problem into sub-problems. Kornai was also an early promoter of the introduction of decentralization and the use of market forces in socialist economies.   Kornai 1980 book was a a widely-read expose of the chronic difficulties and perverse results of central planning.  Kornai also dabbled in methodology and philosophy, providing a critique of Walrasian general equilibrium theory (1971) and a searching evaluation and critique of the socialist experiment (1992). From 1986, Kornai was appointed as professor of economics at Harvard, a position he held jointly with his position in Budapest.   In the post-communist era, Kornai transitioned into a specialist on post-socialist transition economies.

Simon Kuznets, 1901-1985.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kuznets.htm," The Russian-born Simon Kuznets left Soviet Russia in 1922, emigrating to New York.  He became a student of Wesley Mitchell at Columbia and subsequently a researcher at Mitchell's National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in 1926.   It was no surprise, then, that Kuznets took his master's creed to heart: that the painstaking collection of empirical data was a priority. Kuznets's life work was the collection and organisation of the national income accounts of the United States (1934, 1941, 1946), an accomplishment that inspired that of Richard Stone and James Meade  in Great Britain. Kuznets work fit hand in glove with two other developments at the time: the emergence of econometrics and the Keynesian Revolution, both of which found in Kuznets's data an important resource for their advancement. Kuznets, however, was neither a Keynesian nor an econometrician.  Instead,  Kuznets took his methodological cues from Mitchell's Institutionalism, in particular the empirical analysis of business cycles.  Kuznets (1930) identified a 15-20 year cycle to which his name was later attached, the ""Kuznets Cycle"". Kuznets was also one of the earliest workers on development economics, in particular collecting and analyzing the empirical characteristics of developing countries (1965, 1966, 1971, 1979). His major thesis, which argued that underdeveloped countries of today possess characteristics different from those that industrialized countries faced before they developed, helped put an end to the simplistic view that all countries went through the same ""linear stages"" in their history and launched the separate field of development economics - which now focused on the analysis of modern underdeveloped countries' distinct experiences. Among his several discoveries which sparked important theoretical research programs was his discovery of the inverted U-shaped relation between income inequality and economic growth (1955, 1963).  Kuznets also discovered the patterns in savings-income behavior which launched the Life-Cycle/Permanant-Income Hypothesis of Modigliani and Friedman. For all his patient yet crucial work, Kuznets won the Nobel Memorial in 1971.  He was at Harvard at the time.

Ludwig M. Lachmann, 1906-1990.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lachmann.htm," German Austrian School economist. The German economist Ludwig Lachmann was trained in the German Historical tradition, obtaining his degree at the University of Berlin under Werner Sombart in 1930.  With the ascent of the Nazis in 1933, Lachmann left Germany, and emigrated to England, enrolling at the London School of Economics (L.S.E).   At the LSE, Lachmann quickly came under the spell of  Friedrich Hayek and firm convert to the Austrian School.  A research fellowship allowed him to visit the United States, where Lachmann attended Knight's seminar at Chicago.  In 1943, Lachmann taught economics at the Univeristy of Hull (UK).  In 1948, Lachmann moved to the Republic of South Africa, to take up a position as professor of economics at the University of Witswatersrand, a position he would hold until his retirement.  In the latter part of his career, he taught the occasional semester at NYU. Devoutly dedicated to Menger's original vision of an entirely subjective economics, Lachmann attempted to detach the Austrian paradigm from its Walrasian and Jevonian companions. His early training at the hands of Werner Sombart and his prediliction for Weber had a methodological effect: Austrian Theory, Lachmann concluded, was to be characterized as a ""genetic-causal"" approach, a ""verstende"" view of social science to be wrought against the mathematical-functional, equilibrium, perfect- foresight approach of mainstream Neoclassical economics. The ""fundentalist Austrianism"" of Lachmann was unique at the time - none of the then living Austrian economists really acknowledged their work to be as different from the mainstream as Lachmann claimed. But his work stressed all the points he thought distinctive: subjectivism, expectations, uncertainty, the Hayekian cycle, time-defined capital, methodological individualism, alternative cost and, above all, ""market process"". Although Lachmann was effectively ""exiled"" from economics while at Witwatersrand in South Africa, his work was highly influential upon the later ""American branch"" of the Austrian School. His work on capital theory (1956) resonates issues which were soon to be taken up in the Cambridge Capital Controversy.      Major works of Ludwig M.

Abbé Félicité Robert de Lamennais, 1782-1854,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lamennais.htm," French Catholic clergyman and Christian socialist activist.  Initially advocated the marriage of the French Liberal tradition with Catholic doctrine, emphasizing freedom of consciousness, worship, speech and the press, abolition of the death penalty and the separation of Church and State.  His main vehicles, were his pamphlets (like his celebrated Paroles, 1834) and his journal, l'Avenir.   Lamennais caused quite a stir and he attracted many admirers, but it embroiled him in a protracted conflict with Royalist Conservatives and the Pope himself.  After being excommunicated and breaking with the Catholic Church in 1836 (and spending a year in prison in 1841), Lamennais devoted himself to socialist-democratic causes. In his 1848 book, he analyzed the plight of workers under the industrial revolution in fiery ""class struggle"" language.  He believed the extension of suffrage to the working classes would be the only way to achieve the legalization of trade unions, universal education, diffusion of property and thereby economic emancipation.  He participated in the 1848 Revolution, but was purged in the aftermath.

Fedele Lampertico, 1833-1906,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lampertico.htm,"Italian politician and economist, one of the leaders of the historicist Lombard-Venetian School. Fedele Lampertico was born in Vicenza, then part of Austrian-ruled Veneto, to a wealthy landowning family. Lampertico studied law at the University of Padua, and graduated in 1855 with a thesis on the Prussian statistician Gottfried Achenwall.  An Italian nationalist, Fedele Lampertico was compelled to leave Vicenza in 1866, but returned after the annexation of Veneto into the Republic of Italy in November that same year. Lampertico served as a political leader in Vicenza, and was made senator of Italy in 1873. Fedele Lampertico followed a political career, and did not seek out a university position.  Nonetheless, he read voraciously and was a prolific writer on economics.  Lampertico had close friendships with leading Italian academics like the statistician Angelo Messedaglia and historicist Luigi Luzzatto.   Lampertico's most influential work is his multi-volume L'Economia dei Popoli e degli Stati, much influenced by the German Historical School and critical of the Ricardian classical school.   Lampertico's work was the target of the polemics against the ""Lombard-Venetian school"" launched by the prominent Italian liberal  economist Francesco Ferrara in the pages of the Nuova Antologia in the Summer of 1874.  The methodenstreit between Ferrara and Lampertico drove a split in Italian economics between the liberal ""Tuscan"" school and the historicist ""Lombard-Venetian"" school.  Lampertico and fellow historicists signed the ""Padua manifesto"" in September 1874, and organized the Milan congress in January 1875, which launched the historicist ""Associazone per il progresso degli studi economici"". That same year, Lampertico was one of four economists appointed to the new social science section of the prestigious Accademia dei Lincei in Rome.

Adolphe Landry, 1874-1956.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/landry.htm," French Historicist, economist and politician, notable for his contributions to population theory and the concept of the ""demographic transition"". Of an old Corsican family, Adolphe Landry was born in Ajaccio and raised in Nimes.   Landry was educated at the École normale supérieure (ENS) in Paris, and in 1901 submitted a socialist-tinged doctoral thesis on private property.  For the next few years, Landry was a teacher  at Toulouse and the Collège Chaptal in Paris.  During this period, captivated by the Austrian School, .Landry wrote a notable 1904 treatise restating Bohm-Bawerk's theory of capital in terms of time preference. In 1907, Adolphe Landry was appointed to the chair in the history of economic doctrines at the  École Pratique des Hautes Études, which he would retain (with brief interruptions) for the rest of his career.  Adolphe Landry also maintained a parallel political career.  He was elected to the French parliament as a deputy for Corsica in 1910, and remained in politics down to  his retirement in 1946. Adolphe Landry is chiefly remembered as for his theory of demographic transition.  In an article in 1909, Landry reviewing population theories of past economists - notably  Joseph Townsend and Richard Cantillon. Landry identified the theories were not contradictory but applied successively at different historical stages of economic development.  In his works on demographic transition (1909, 1934), Landry identified three phases of fertility.  In the first phase (the ""Townsend phase""), birth rates are biologically-determined, natural and unconstrained, the population size kept in check by mortality and population growth rates determined primarily by fluctuating death rates.  In the second phase (the Cantillon phase), birth rates are economically-determined, in that people seeking to maintain a standard of living consciously decide to postpone marriage until they can afford it, and thus there are longer periods of celibacy, reducing overall fertility and slowing down population growth.  The third stage emerges when people, aspiring to improve their standard of living, deliberately decide to limit their family size within marriage.  For Landry, this third stage is most worrisome for replication is not even guaranteed, and it can induce a population decline. He used the term ""demographic revolution"" (the title for his 1934 collection of essays). From 1910, Landry was a founder and activist of various associations to promote large families and population growth, which took a particularly urgent turn after WWI.  Landry would serve as a minister in various governments of the Third Republic. Most notable is perhaps his tenure as Ministre du Travail in 1931-32, where he was responsible for introducing family and social policies to encourage large families and demographic recovery.

Oskar Lange, 1904-1965.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lange.htm," Born 1904 near Lodz, Poland, the son of a textile merchant.  Oskar (sometimes spelled :""Oscar"") Lange studied law and economics at Poznan and Cracow, where he graduated in 1928.  His socialist tendencies led him into the ""neutral"" camp of statistics, which he taught for several years at Cracow.   In 1934, a Rockefeller fellowship brought him to England and subsequently the United States.  In 1936, Lange began teaching at the University of Michigan then, in 1938, he became a professor at the University of Chicago.  Towards the end of World War II, in a highly controversial move, Lange broke with the Polish government-in-exile in London and transferred his support to the Lublin Committee sponsored by the Soviet Union. (Lange actually served as the go-between for Roosevelt and Stalin in 1944 during discussions of the post-war Polish borders and character of its government).  In 1945-6, Lange left Chicago and was appointed the Polish Ambassador to the United States.  In 1946, Lange served as the Polish delegate to the United Nations Security Council.  He returned to Poland in 1947, where he continued working for the Polish government, while continuing his academic pursuits at the University of Warsaw and the Central School of Planning and Statistics. The bulk of Lange's contributions to economics came during his American interlude of 1933-1945.  Although an ardent socialist, Lange deplored the Marxian labor theory of value, being very much a believer in the Neoclassical theory of price.  He put these two together famously in his 1938 On the Economic Theory of Socialism, where he argued that a state-run economy could at least be as efficient - if not more efficient -- than a free market economy.  Lange argued that this was possible if the government planners used the price system as if in a market economy and instructed state industry managers to respond parametrically to the state-determined prices (minimize cost, etc.).  Lange's argument was one of the pivots of the Socialist Calculation Debate with the Austrian School.  Although Lange flourished at the University of Chicago,  he was not, of course, a member of the its more narrowly-defined ""school"".  Rather, he remained content to consort with the Cowles Commission researchers next door.  Lange became one of the leading lights of the ""Paretian Revival"" in general equilibrium theory during the 1930s.  In 1942, he provided one of the first proofs of  First and Second Welfare Theorems.  He initiated the analysis of stability of general equilibrium (1942, 1944).  His critique of the Quantity Theory of money (1942) prompted his student, Don Patinkin, on to his remarkable ""integration"" of money into general equilibrium theory.  Lange also made several seminal contributions to the development of the Neo-Keynesian Synthesis (e.g. 1938, 1943, 1944). The post-1945 period, Lange's fortunes changed.  His particularly close association with the Stalinist government of Poland and his political activities on their behalf marred both his economics and his respectability in the economics profession.  He was particularly taken to task by fellow economists for papers he wrote lauding Stalin as an ""economic theorist"" (e.g. 1953).  Nonetheless, Lange never regarded himself as anything else but a socialist activist as well as Marxian economist.  Neoclassical economics was always a computational tool, not an ideological one.  Throughout the remainder of his life, Lange strove to bring Neoclassical pricing theory into Soviet-style economic planning practices and integrating Classical and Neoclassical economics into a single theoretical structure (e.g. 1959).  In his final years, Lange worked on cybernetics and the use of computers for economic planning.      Major works of Oskar Lange     Resources on Oskar Lange All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Harold J. Laski, 1893-1950.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/laski.htm," British political scientist,  Fabian Socialist and Labour politician. Originating from a Jewish manufacturing family in Manchester, Harold Joseph Laski was educated at New College, Oxford.  After eloping with a Christian bride, Laski took a sojourn North America, notably lecturing briefly at Harvard (1916-1920), where he wrote his first books. Harold Joseph Laski was hired at the L.S.E. to supplement and eventually succeed Graham Wallas in political science in 1920. Laski would become one of the leading spirits of the institution.  A dedicated socialist, Laski was always involved in politics, particularly in the 1930s.  From 1922, he sat on the executive committee of the Fabian Society and then was elevated, in 1936, to the executive committee of the British Labour Party (he was chairman in 1945-1946).

Étienne Laspeyres, 1834-1913,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/laspeyres.htm,"German economist and statistician, member of the ""Young"" German Historical School. Ernst Louis Étienne Laspeyres was born in Halle, the son of a prominent Prussian jurist, descended from French Huguenot emigrants, who fled to Germany in the 17th Century.  From 1853, Étienne Laspeyres studied law and cameralistics at a series of German universities - Tübingen, Berlin, Göttingen, Halle and Heidelberg. He obtained his doctorate in law from Halle in 1857. Laspeyres obtained his Ph.D. from Heidelberg under Wilhelm Roscher. That same year, he submitted his habilitation thesis on wage and population growth, and was appointed lecturer (privat-dozent) at Heidelberg.

Laspeyres's 1863 study on 17th C. Dutch economic thought was well-received, and earned him a call to the University of Amsterdam, but he turned it down. Instead, in 1864, he took up a position as ordinary (full) professor of political science (Staatswissenschaft) at the University of Basel (Switzerland). But he did not stay put. He moved to the Baltics to take up a position at Riga Polytechnic (Russian Latvia) in 1866, and then took up a chair in statistics at the German-speaking University of Dorpat (Russian Estonia) in 1869.

Laspeyres returned to Germany in 1873, to take up a position at the Karlsruhe Polytechnic in Baden.  But the very next year (1874), Laspeyres became professor at the University of Giessen (in Hesse-Darmstadt), a chair he would retain until  his retirement in1900. Laspeyres served simultaneously on the Hessian state statistics bureau from 1874. Laspeyres is best known for the Laspeyres price index, which he presented in 1864 and final form in 1871.

Ferdinand Lassalle, 1825-1864.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lassalle.htm,"German lawyer, leader of the socialist movement in Germany, founder of the SPD.  Son of a Jewish businessman from Breslau, Ferdinand Lassalle studied philosophy at Berlin, where he came into the Young Hegelian circle.  It was in this milieu that Lassalle met and befriended Karl Marx (the sentiment was not quite reciprocated).  In the upheavals of 1848, Ferdinand Lassalle became involved with the Neue Rheinische Zeitung and was briefly arrested for his activities in Dusseldorf. Subsequently earning his living as an attorney, Lassalle's earliest works (1858-1861) were primarily conventional works of literature, philosophy and law, but he remained involved in public affairs.  Ferdinand Lassalle did not adopt Marx's ideas but rather subscribed to the ""State Socialist"" doctrines of Rodbertus.  Drawing on his Hegelian roots, Lassalle condemned the ""liberal"" perspective of government as a mere guarantor of law-and-order, arguing that government is (and has always been) an agent of social change, for better or for worse.  It was consequently mere common sense to harness the State's power for social ""betterment"".  So, rather than condemning private property as such (as more radical socialist did), Lassalle was keen to point out that the State socialism ought to merely ""fix"" the social ill-effects of capitalism.   A believer in Malthus's population doctrines, Lassalle argued that Malthusian wage-fertility dynamics ensure that workers will be forever condemned to subsistence wages unless they managed to also retain profit for themselves. It was Lassalle, incidentally who coined the term ""iron law of wages"" to describe the Classical theory. Lassalle's belief in the iron law seemed to ""exempt"" capitalists from direct blame for the plight of worker incomes.      However, unlike Rodbertus, Lassalle did not believe that it was enough to merely supplement capitalism with State redistributive schemes to raise workers' incomes. Rather, he primarily advocated the setting up new worker-run cooperative enterprises (with State-provided capital) to compete (and eventually replace) private capitalist enterprises.  In this manner, workers would retain their own surplus value and the politically-contentious issue of income redistribution could be momentarily side-stepped.   In May, 1863, Ferdinand Lassalle formed the Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein (ADAV, General Union of German Workers), the first German labor party.  In a 1863 manifesto, Lassalle articulated two concrete goals for the movement: universal suffrage and the introduction of State-sponsored producer cooperatives. The opportunistic Prussian Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, co-opted Lassalle's agenda and support, believing that the working class would be a good ally for him in his struggle against bourgois liberals.  However, before anything came of this, Lassalle was killed in a duel over a love affair.   The division between Lassallians and Marxians continued for the next decade after his death.  Finally, in 1875, at Gotha, Lassalle's party was united to the Marxist Socialdmokratische Arbeiterpartei led by Liebnicht and Bebel to form the single Sozialistischen Arbeiterpartei (SAP, the precursor of the modern Social Democratic Party, SPD).  However, the resulting manifesto of the united party was more Lassallian than Marxian in content.  Marx fulminated against Lassalle's doctrines in his Critique of the Gotha Program.  The SPD's Gotha program was replaced in 1891 by the Erfurt Program, which brought it closer to orthodox Marxian lines. Lassalle was highly influential on the German Historical School and the Marxist revisionist Eduard Bernstein (who wrote a biography of Lassalle in 1893). Lassalle's life is given a literary treatment in George Meredith novel, The Tragic Comedians.

"James Maitland, Earl Lauderdale", 1759-1838.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lauderdale.htm," James Maitland studied at the University of Edinburgh, and after an interlude in Paris and Oxford, completed his studies at the University of Glasgow under John Millar.  He subsequently studied law at Lincoln's Inn and was admitted to the bar in 1780.   Lauderdale promptly launched his political career.  With his father still sitting in the House of Lords, the younger Maitland ran and was elected to a seat in the House of Commons in 1780.  In parliament, Maitland quickly aligned himself with Charles James Fox's Whigs, backing their motions on America and the East India bill of 1783.  Lauderdale was appointed to the house committee to impeach former India governor Warren Hastings in 1787. After his father's death in 1789, James Maitland became the 8th Earl of Lauderdale and was bumped upstairs as a Scottish peer in the House of Lords in 1790. As a Tory majority was elected, Lauderdale would remain in constant opposition throughout.  The French Revolution had by now broken out.  Lauderdale was enthusiastic, going on to found the ""Friends of People"" in 1792, a political association to push for parliamentary reform in Britain.  On his way to a vacation in Italy, Lauderdale was in France in summer of 1792, witnessing the bloody pangs of France's conversion into a republic and cut their trip short.  Nonetheless, on his return, Lauderdale continued to defend the French cause in parliament, pushed for peace with France and protested the crackdown on civil liberties in Britain.  Despite his principled stances on the floor, the outspoken and often violent-tempered Lauderdale was not above jutting his elbows, making numerous political enemies.  Lauderdale struck at his opponents in a stinging 1794 pamphlet, and spitefully attempted to use a technicality to strip Edmund Burke of his pension.  As a result, the Tory government arranged it so Lauderdale was not summoned back to the parliament of 1796 (nor that of 1802). After fruitless protests, Lauderdale contemplated surrendering his noble title in order to run for a seat in Commons.   Excluded from Parliament after 1796, Lauderdale took to pamphleteering.   Lauderdale's 1797 and 1798 pamphlets were direct attacks on the prime minister William Pitt's reputed economic wizardry, compiling budget data to show the amount of government waste that had been going on.  Lauderdale opposed Pitt's income tax and in an anonymous tract (1799), explained how its incidence would be shifted unequally, and promoted an inheritance tax instead. As part of his research, Lauderdale took to reading economics.  The high treatise of the time was Adam Smith's 1776 Wealth of Nations, which he duly dug through.  But apparently Lauderdale also read John Law's 1705 Money and Trade Considered, which posited a demand-and-supply theory of value.   Lauderdale found the theories contradicted each other, and came to the conclusion that Law was right and Smith was wrong. Laurderdale published his thoughts in his 1804  Inquiry into the Nature and Origins of Public Wealth.  Although broadly sympathetic to Adam Smith, Lauderdale adamantly denounced his labor theory of value was confused and mistaken.   Goods, Lauderdale asserts, have no ""real, intrinsic or invariable value"" (cf. also p.38).  Instead,  ""to confer value...two things appear requisite: 1. that the commodity, as being useful or delightful to man, should be an object of his desire; 2. that it should exist in a degree of scarcity"" (p.12).  He proposed that the demand-and-supply mechanism should be used to determine long-run price (""the degree of value....would vary according to the proportion betwixt the quantity of them and the demand for them"" p.13).  As such, Lauderdale can be considered a precursor of the Marginalist Revolution.  Lauderdale also gives a clearer statement than Smith on the new definition of the ""wealth of a nation"" as the volume of consumption goods (p.55). Lauderdale's 1804 pamphlet was noticed, and Henry Brougham gave a deep review of it in the Edinburgh Review.  Lauderdale replied to the review, which provoked a sharp rejoinder from Brougham. Lauderdale put out a second, enlarged edition in 1819. Lauderdale would remain a thorn in the side of Classical School.   David Ricardo himself took pains to refute his thesis.  Interestingly, Lauderdale was among the first to propose that capital was a substitute, not a complement, of labor.  He was consequently among the first to have raised the possibility of technological unemployment. Lauderdale's concerns (articulated in the 1819 edition) prompted Ricardo to write his famous chapter on machinery in 1821.  Lauderdale was also an early proponent of the underconsumption thesis, i.e. that excess saving can be the cause of crisis.  He also defended the Corn Laws in 1814. In money matters, Lauderdale was a Bullionist, urging immediate resumption of convertibility (1812, 1813) but at the same time was a prescient proponent of functional finance (cf. 1829 Three Letters), urging increased government expenditure and denouncing the sinking fund as contractionary to the economy, and consequently inimical to public welfare. In 1804, Lauderdale had promised a second volume to follow up on his Inquiry dealing with more practical matters of economic legislation, but political events soon took over.  Pitt died in January 1806, and the new ""All Talents"" government of William Grenville was opened up to Fox and his Whigs.  Lauderdale was first offered the governor-generalship of India - but it was withdrawn after the EIC directors balked at their old tormentor being foisted upon them (Cobb).  So Lauderdale was instead given the position as keeper of the seal of Scotland, making him a member of the Privy Council.   In the summer of 1806, Lauderdale was in France as a British emissary to peace negotiations, but returned by October after the talks broke down.  After the All-Talents miinistry collapsed in March 1807, Lauderdale resigned from government.  Lauderdale remained in opposition in the House of Lords for a few more years, but gradually shifted his views, giving support over to the Tories (although he was never made a minister in any of of the Earl of Liverpool's many Tory governments) and becoming a proponent of the Corn Laws of 1815 and an opponent of parliamentary reform.

James Laurence Laughlin, 1850-1933.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/laughlin.htm," J. Laurence Laughlin was the American arch-conservative monetary economist at Chicago..  Born in Deerfield, Ohio, James Laurence Laughlin obtained his B.A. in history from Harvard in 1873.  In 1878, Laughlin became an instructor in economics at Harvard  under Charles Dunbar, replacing Silas MacVane (who had moved on to history).  After receiving his Ph.D (in history), Laughlin was appointed assistant professor at Harvard in 1883.  He left his post in 1887 to work for a Philadelphia insurance company.  In 1890, Laughlin returned to academia, becoming a professor of political economy and finance at Cornell.  He was there a scarce two years before the newly-created University of Chicago invited him, in 1892, to form its first economics department and take up the editorship of the fledgling Journal of Political Economy.  Laughlin took his Cornell protegés Adolph C. Miller and Thorstein Veblen.  J. Laurence Laughlin would preside over the first few decades of Chicago economics, and gave it its first imprint, which, in several ways, foreshadowed the future ""Chicago School"".  Despite his friendships with many radical Institutionalists (notably Veblen), Laughlin was dogmatically (Neo)classical (relying strictly on J.S. Mill and later Alfred Marshall), a strident free-market and ""hard money"" man.   In 1883, Laughlin helped found the conservative ""Political Economy Club"" in New York and refused to join  the American Economic Association.  Laughlin's reputation rests on his work in monetary economics.  He was a vocal opponent to bimetallism and one of the more avid promoters of the Federal Reserve system.   J. Laurence Laughlin founded the National Citizens' League for the Promotion of a Sound Banking System in 1911 in Chicago, putting out a series of pamphlets in the run up to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.

Carl Wilhelm Friedrich Launhardt, 1832-1918.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/launhardt.htm," German engineer-economist, pioneer of industrial location theory. Wilhelm Laundhart was born in Hanover, and spent virtually his entire life in that city.  Launhardt career was largely without contact with the academics of the Geman Historical School, and his trajectory and development is more line with the French engineering tradition.  After a period as a civil engineer working on public highways,  Launhardt was appointed professor of engineering at the Hanover Polytechnic in 1869, eventually rising to director. Lanhardt's theory of industrial location was originally developed in two articles separated by a decade.  The first article (1872) stemmed from his work for roads, Launhardt started formulating mathematical principles for efficient road network planning.  The second (1882) began asking about the optimal location of an industrial plant.  These were then worked into and expanded into Launhardt's1887-88 Theorie des Trassirens  (translated into English as the Theory of the Trace in 1900-02).

Having already had a bit of an early career as a banker for a decade, Frederick Lavington enrolled in 1908 at Emmanuel College, Cambridge at a rather mature age.  Lavington was one of the first pupils of John Maynard Keynes, and quickly excelled in economics.  After graduating in 1911, Lavington served for several years on the Board of Trade. Lavington returned to Cambridge in 1918.  He was made Girdler lecturer in 1920 and fellow of Emmanuel College in 1922.  In his brief academic career, Frederick Lavington remained perhaps one of the most orthodox of the Marshallian school, famous for his quip ""It's all in Marshall, if one only digs deeply enough"". Lavington articulated a version of the Cambridge ""cash-balance"" approach to monetary theory in his celebrated 1921 handbook.  In some readings, he is even regarded as the progenitor of the theory of liquidity preference (Lavington characterized interest as a ""payment for uncertainty""). He was also among the first to recommend that the Bank of England target interest rates as a counter-cyclical policy. Lavington's 1922 book on the trade cycle elaborated on the themes of his earlier work. Lavington followed closely the works of Pigou and Robertson, and identified excessive confidence as the linchpin of the cycle, optimism breeding further optimism, pessimism further pessimism.

Emil Lederer, 1882-1939.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lederer.htm," Although educated at the University of Vienna, in the same cohort as Ludwig von Mises and Joseph Schumpeter, Emil Lederer was nonetheless not a member of the Austrian School. Indeed, influenced by Rudolf Hilferding, Lederer can be considered one of the last members of the ""Austro-Marxists"". However, he differed substantially from them on several crucial aspects.  The first was the importance Lederer gave to the rise of the ""white-collar"" service class (1912), which he believed implied substantial modifications in standard Marxian theory.  His second point of difference was on the theory of  crisis. Lederer argued (1927) that the concentration of capital was actually a destabilizing feature for capitalism.  More specifically, in his work on structural growth  theory (e.g. 1931), he insisted on the importance of technological change as the source of unemployment, putting him closer to Tugan-Baranovsky than the old ""underconsumptionist"" Marxians.  His work also put him in touch with the approach being developed by Adolph Lowe and the Kiel Institute group. Lederer was also active in Social Democratic circles in both Austria and Germany. After the First World War, Lederer was a member of the German Socialization Committee under Hilferding and Kautsky in Berlin, where he was soon joined by Adolph Lowe, Eduard Heimann and his old Vienna classmate, Joseph Schumpeter.  Lederer's rise in academia continued apace: Lederer became a professor of economics at Heidelberg (assistant in 1918, full from 1920).  In 1931, Lederer became professor at the powerful University of Berlin, succeeding to the chair of Werner Sombart. He counted Hans Speier and Jacob Marschak among his assistants. This was all cut short by the Nazi rise to power. Emil Lederer proved instrumental in helping the flow of intellectual refugees out of Germany and to the United States - particularly to the New School for Social Research.

Leijonhufvud obtained his Ph.D. from Northwestern in 1967. Partly under the influence of Robert Clower, Leijonhufvud produced a dissertation which was to profoundly affect macroeconomics for the next decade: On Keynesian Economics and the Economics of Keynes (1968). Perhaps the first serious scholarly study of Keynes's work, Leijonhufvud's book differentiated between ""Keynesian Economics"" (Hicks-Samuelson type of synthesis) and ""Economics of Keynes"" (the work of J.M. Keynes) and essentially demonstrated that the two had little in common. He joined Clower in calling for a dynamic, ""microfounded"" formulation of Keynesian theory which explained underemployment equilibrium rather than merely referring to it as an imperfection. In particular, Leijonhufvud relies on differing speeds of quantity and price adjustments to create the coordination failures which yield protracted unemployment. His later work in the 1970s and 1980s still mirrored this quest. In the 1990s, Clower and Leijonhufvud identified the fast-growing evolutionary theory and computational economics as moving in the right direction and founded a fledgling school, ""Post Walrasian"", intent on harnessing macroeconomics to it.  Axel Leijonhufvud joined the faculty at UCLA in 1964.  Since 1995, he has also been professor at the University of Trento, Italy.

Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, 1870-1924.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lenin.htm," Russian Marxist, revolutionary leader and statesman.  Born in Simbirsk, Vladimir Illyich Ulyanov (better known under his alias, ""Lenin"") was the second son of a Russian provincial official. His elder brother, Alexander, was active in the peasant-socialist Narodnik movement and, in early 1887, was tried and executed by Tsarist authorities, an event which greatly influenced the young Lenin.   In the fall of 1887, Lenin enrolled at the University of Kazan to study law, but immediately got involved in political study circles and was soon expelled.  It was during this time that he came across the works of Karl Marx and Friederich Engels.  In 1889, Lenin moved to Samara and then, in 1893, to St. Petersburg.  He was active in political study groups in both these cities. Lenin participated in the debate between Social Democrats and Narodniks on the relevance of Marxism (which primarily applied to industrial capitalism) to semi-feudal agricultural societies like Russia.  Although an admirer of Plekhanov, Lenin had little faith in the Narodnik program (1894).      In 1895, Lenin formed the League for the Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class in St. Petersburg.  However, in the aftermath of a general strike in 1896,  the League was broken up and Lenin and his companions were temporarily sent into internal exile in Siberia.   In 1898, Lenin founded the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP), the forerunner of the communist party, and became director of Iskra, the party's newspaper.  In 1903, at the second congress of the RSDLP (held abroad in London and Paris), the communists split into two factions.  The ""minority"" (Menshevik) faction advocated the overthrow of the Tsarist regime and the introduction of bourgeois democracy (plus limited land reforms and protection for labor).  The ""majority"" (Bolshevik) faction, headed by Lenin, aimed for the more radical program of immediate abolition of the capitalist mode of production and the establishment of the ""dictatorship of the proletariat"".  Lenin's reasoning can be deciphered in his 1898 Development of Capitalism in Russia.  Russia, Lenin emphasized, was, unlike Britain and other capitalist nations, a ""late industrializer"".  As a result, much of the industrialization program had been driven by Tsarist directives from above and placed in the hands of a very small politically-connected elite (i.e. what in modern days we would call ""crony capitalism"").  So, by sheer force of the Tsar's will, Russia had leapfrogged over the early stages of small-scale, competitive capitalism and straight into large-scale monopoly capitalism.  As a result, the Russian bourgeoisie (and its attendant democratic structures) never had the chance to emerge or take hold.  And, assuming Marx's theory of increasing concentration of capital held true, there was no reason to hope that the small bourgeoisie would ever end up dominant in Russia.   Thus the Mensheviks, by resting their hopes on the Russian middle-class, were still saddling a horse for a race that had long begun without it.  For the Narodniks (and their political successors, the Socialist Revolutionaries, or SRs), who relied on peasant populism to usher in the arrival of socialism, Lenin had a similar pessimistic conclusion.  The abolition of serfdom had led to increasing commercialization of the countryside (notably the emergence of rich peasants, the kulaks).  This process, Lenin argued, had already rended the ancient peasant communes apart and thus disabled them as a force for revolutionary change. Thus the focus of socialist activists in Russia, Lenin (1898) concluded, had to be among the workers in the large factories of the monopoly capitalists.  There, large numbers of workers, in close proximity and in wretched conditions, were just firewood waiting for a spark.   Lenin's prediction seemed to come true during the 1905 uprising against the Tsarist regime in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese War.  Infected by anarcho-syndicalist notions, industrial workers throughout Russia spontaneously took over factories and set up workers' councils (soviets) to organize strikes and armed uprisings.  In his October Manifesto, Tsar Nicholas II promised to introduce a democratic parliament (Duma) in Russia and, in subsequent months, the soviets were dismantled one by one.  By helping to introduce bourgeois democracy into Russia, the 1905 revolution may seem to have advanced the Menshevik cause.  But the Bolsheviks were more eager to point out that the ""revolutionary potential"" of the Russian industrial working class had become evident.  The events of 1905 were merely a ""dress-rehearsal"" for what was to come. In 1916, Lenin published his famous work on imperialism.  Drawing upon Hobson, Lenin argued that as the increasing concentration of capital in the west had failed to stave off the declining rate of profit, monopoly capitalists had taken control of political institutions of western democracies and urged them towards imperialist goals.  Thus, imperialism was actually ""caused"" by the need for export markets by monopoly capitalists.  Lenin predicted that the trade wars caused by ""inter-imperial"" rivalry could lead (inadvertently or otherwise) to hot military wars - the First World War being the case in point.  Lenin's thesis on imperialism was contrasted with Kautsky's, which saw imperialism merely as a ""mistake"", or bad policy decisions, and not a necessary development. In early 1917, exhausted, famished and demoralized by the First World War, Russians had started grumbling again.  A wave of strikes in St. Petersburg (Petrograd) in February was followed (once again) by the sprouting up of workers' councils (soviets) in Russian cities.  In March, the Petrograd Soviet anointed a provisional committee from the Russian Duma as the effective government of Russia.  Tsar Nicholas II abdicated the next day. For Lenin, who was in exile in Switzerland at the time, it was obvious that the alliance of convenience between the bourgeois Provisional Committee and the proletarian soviets was doomed to unravel.  The Provisional Government had miscalculated the basic popular desire for peace and decided to maintain Russia's involvement in the war.  In March 1917, hoping to use him as an agent saboteur, the German authorities dispatched Lenin in a sealed train from Zurich to Russia.  Upon his arrival at Finland Station in Petrograd in April, Lenin denounced the Provisional Committee and the continuation of the ""imperialist"" war and set to work bringing the soviets and the army over to the Bolshevik cause.   In July, 1917, an army mutiny, encouraged by the Bolsheviks, broke out and radicalized soldiers took to the streets, demanding an end to the war, the immediate dissolution of the Provisional Committee and the transfer of all power over to the soviets.  But the soviets themselves (dominated by Mensheviks and SRs), instead of accepting power from these ""unpatriotic traitors"", unleashed loyal garrisons to crush the mutinous elements.  For the remainder of the summer, Bolshevik agents were purged from the army and driven underground.  Lenin himself had to don a disguise and flee to Finland. The flagging Bolshevik cause received a boost with the failure of the summer offensive against Germany, a Tsarist coup attempt in August, the continuation of food shortages in the cities and chaos in the countryside brought about by the failure of land reforms.  Clearly, Russia was in trouble and the Provisional Government seemed either powerless or unwilling to do anything about it.   The Bolsheviks' radical program, garlanded by the slogans ""Land, Bread, Peace"", at least promised to change the situation.   But Lenin had learnt from the July debacle, and was wary of calling for an immediate uprising.  Instead, he ordered Bolshevik agents to infiltrate and take control of the soviets so that any future actions and insurrections would at least seem to be ""officially"" sanctioned, and not merely Bolsheviks acting on their own.  Lenin also had to ensure that the major garrisons would at least stay ""neutral"" in the event of an uprising,   Lenin appointed his lieutenant, Leon Trotsky, as his liasion to the garrisons.    In late October, 1917, once the imposing garrison of the Peter and Paul fortress in Petrograd promised to comply with the Bolsheviks, everything was in place.  In the early morning hours of October 24 (November 6, by the modern calendar), the revolution began.  Bolshevik detachments took control of Petrograd, arrested the members of the Provisional Government (at the Winter Palace) while the new Bolshevik-dominated congress of soviets (at the Smolny Institute) formally transferred all power to the soviets and elected a Council of People's Commissars (with Lenin as its chairman) as the new executive government.   The Bolsheviks had succeeded.   Similar uprising occurred in other Russian cities and by March, 1918, most of central Russia had come over to the Bolsheviks. In his original plan, Lenin had envisaged a post-Revolutionary Russia which would be ""in between"" capitalism and socialism.  He took as his model the German Bismarckian economy, where the ""commanding heights"" of the economy (banking, coal, iron, petroleum, heavy industry, railroads, etc.) were in the hands of a few monopolists, while the rest of the economy (notably agriculture) remained in the hands of small private entrepreneurs.  The only difference Lenin hoped to introduce to the German model was that the Russian State would take the role of the private monopolists in controlling the commanding heights. However, Lenin's first priority was to meet his promises of peace, land and bread.  He immediately issued two decrees: one proclaiming Russia's commitment to seeking peace with the Axis powers and another instituting land reform.   Peace was achieved in the hastily-drafted Peace of Brest-Litovsk with Germany, pulling Russia out of the First World War -- although war would return swiftly in the form of a brutal four-year civil war between the ""Reds"" and the ""Whites"". The Civil War postponed Lenin's economic plans for Russia.   From 1917 to 1921, Lenin accepted ""War Communism"", by which the State took direct control of industry, channeled capital to military purposes, introduced forced requisitions and expropriations of surpluses, etc.  A State Planning Committee (Gosplan) was set up to coordinate the war industries.   However, once the Civil War began to fade away, Lenin's original plan re-emerged in the form of the ""New Economic Policy"" (NEP).  However, by this time, Lenin had been incapacitated by a series of strokes and his participation was minimal. Lenin's most significant contribution to the Soviet economy was probably his plan for the electrification of Russia unveiled in late 1920.  He oversaw the appointment of a committee of engineers and economists to a new state agency, GOELRO, to construct nearly thirty large power stages and establish a electrical grid throughout all of Russia.  The odds of such a massive plan succeeding in this devastated country were slim -- and Lenin's vision was derided by foes and friends alike (H.G. Wells would write that ""Lenin who like a good Orthodox Marxist denounces all 'Utopians', has succumbed at last to a Utopia, the Utopia of the electricians."").  But it was remarkably successful.  Electrification proved to be the impetus necessary to get the Russian economy back on the road to recovery.  Lenin's death in 1924 prompted a frantic struggle for succession between his three principal lieutenants, Nikolai Bukharin, Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin.  The Soviet planning debates which emerged mirrored their different preferences. The continuation of Lenin's NEP was championed by Nikolai Bukharin, while Trotsky (and his economics guru Preobrazhensky) urged a return to ""war communism"".  Stalin, at that point just a spokesman for the Soviet administrative elite, supported NEP on a ""wait and see"" basis.  But by 1928, everything had changed -Stalin won the power struggle, and proceeded to scrap NEP and introduce communist central planning..

Wassily Leontief, 1906-1999,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/leontief.htm," Wassily Leontief's name has been associated with a particular type of quantitative economics: input-output analysis.  A general equilibrium method of analysis, input-output models examine economic activity by studying the relationships between sectors. Although of fluctuating popularity, input-output analysis has been a mainstay of economics and economic policy and planning since Leontief introduced it in the 1940s. Wassily Leontief was born into a well-to-do academic family in St. Petersburg, Russia.  His father was a labor economist at the local university, his mother an art historian.  Wassily Leontief enrolled at the University of Leningrad in 1921, at the tender age of fifteen.  He started out in philosophy, but eventually moved on to economics, earning his MA in 1925.  Finding times in Communist Russia difficult, his parents emigrated to Germany, bringing Leontief along with them.  Leontief enrolled for graduate studies at the University of Berlin, obtaining his Ph.D  in 1928 under Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz and Werner Sombart.   Leontief joined the Kiel Institute in 1927, where the seeds of his input-output analysis were laid.  Input-output was partly inspired by the Marxian and Walrasian analysis of general equilibrium via inter-industry flows - which in turn has ancestral origins in Quesnay's Tableau Economique.   Leontief's interest was an outgrowth of the ""multi-sectoral"" approach to business cycles being followed by the Kiel School.  In 1929-30, Leontief interrupted his research to spend a year in China as an economic consultant to the Chinese State railways.  Wassily Leontief moved to the United States in 1931, as a researcher at the NBER, intending to continue his research program into multi-sectoral economic systems.  A year later, Wassily Leontief took up a position at Harvard University in 1932.  Leontief joined Joseph Schumpeter in presiding over the ""golden generation"" of Harvard economics in 1930s.  However, it took some time to set in.  It was only after three years that Leontief was finally allowed to teach his specialty.  Leontief's ""Price Analysis"" seminar, launched in the Fall of 1935, would be the incubator of mathematical economics at Harvard.  Leontief's work at this time was largely in the vein of the Paretian revival, to which he made several seminal contributions (e.g. 1933).  But Leontief was already constructing an empirical example of his input-output system - an effort which yielded his 1941 classic, Structure of American Industry. Leontief followed up this work with a series of classical papers on input-output economics (collected in 1966).   Input-output was novel and inspired large-scale empirical work. It was used for economic planning throughout the world, whether in Western, Socialist or Third World countries, for the next half-century. It was also of crucial theoretical importance. Input-output inspired the analysis of linear production systems, which were instrumental in the development of modern Neo-Walrasian theory.  Unusual for most economic contributions, Leontief's system was also crucial for the revival of  Classical Ricardian theory. The structure of input-output (albeit with some critical differences) was employed by Piero Sraffa and the Neo-Ricardians in the 1960s to resurrect the theories of Ricardo and Marx (although apparently neither Leontief nor Sraffa ever cited each other in their parallel work). Leontief's contributions to economics were not limited to input-output. His 1936 article on ""composite commodities"" made him, together with Hicks, the father of that famous microeconomic theorem. His early reviews of Keynes's General Theory (1936, 1937, 1947, 1948) were important stepping stones to the Neo-Keynesian synthesis's stress on fixed nominal wages in interpreting Keynes's theory. Among his classic contributions are his 1933 article on the analysis of international trade via indifference curves, which is still learned today, his non-linear cobweb model (1934), and his 1946 contribution on the wage contract, which outlined what is now a classical application of the principal-agent model before that term was invented.  One of his more stirring contributions has been his 1953 finding that Americans were exporting labor-intensive rather than capital- intensive goods - the ""Leontief Paradox"" - which brought into question the validity of the conventional factor-proportions theory of international trade. After having presided at Harvard for forty years,  Leontief moved to the C.V. Starr Center at New York University. As a critic, Leontief's repeated admonishment of economics for its misuse of mathematics and quantitative methods and the lack of relevance and realism in its theorizing (e.g. 1938, 1954, 1959, 1971) are both lucid, sharp and still pertinent. It was for his development of input-output that Wassily Leontief won the Nobel memorial prize in 1973.

Frédéric Le Play, 1806-1862 ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/leplay.htm," Pierre Guillaume Frédéric Le Play was a French mining engineer, trained at the École Polytechnique and later professor at the École des Mines. Frédéric Le Play is best known as the leader of the Christian socialist movement.  In 1856, Le Play founded the Société d'économie sociale (which, since 1881, has published the journal La réforme sociale, named after Le Play's famous 1864 manifesto).  Le Play ought to be regarded as a pioneer in the social-survey method, as exemplified in his famous series of studies on the working classes (1855, 1857-85).  In his analysis of social structures, he perceived the solidaristic ""family"" as the main unit of concern.   A deep pessimist of the social impact of the industrial revolution, Le Play advocated legal and social reforms that would encourage a ""family-like"" relationship between capital and labor on the factory floor.

Abba P. Lerner, 1903-1982.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lerner.htm,"  Abba P. Lerner was born in Russia, raised on the London East End and worked as a machinist, a capmaker, a Hebrew teacher, a Rabbinical student and tried his hand at business before enrolling in 1929 at the London School of Economics. It was his early association with the plethora of socialist movements prevalent in the 1920s Britain that brought him into contact with economics. The L.S.E. attracted the self-taught Lerner largely because of its Fabian associations, but found himself instead in the hands of Lionel Robbins.  Lerner's student career -- undergraduate and graduate -- was sheer brilliance.  He published several first-rank papers in economic theory and still found time to launch the Review of Economic Studies with Paul Sweezy and Ursula Webb.  His ""student"" papers catapulted him into the frontlines of the ""Paretian revival"" of the 1930s which consolidated Neoclassical theory.  A six-month stint at Cambridge in 1934-5 brought him into contact with John Maynard  Keynes's ""Circus"".  Lerner subsequently became perhaps the first economist outside that charmed inner circle  to truly grasp the meaning of Keynes's General Theory and, as a result, became also one of the leading pioneers of the Keynesian Revolution. Lerner moved to the United States in 1937, but was never really able to find a home. The footloose Lerner taught at over a half-dozen universities in his career, including, during the 1940s, the New School for Social Research. Abba Lerner's numerous contributions to economic theory and policy make him one of most influential economists of the century -- although his congenital inability to play academic politics ensured that he would not lead a conventional career. His initial contributions, published while he still was a student, were in international trade theory and general equilibrium theory. His 1932 article brought together the Haberler's production possibilities frontier, Marshall's offer curves and Pareto's indifference curves into a two-sector model for international trade. This was followed up in 1934 and have formed the basic way of presenting international trade theory since. Also in 1934, Lerner discovered the ""factor price equalization"" theorem, later rediscovered by Samuelson in 1948, albeit he left it unpublished until 1952. His 1936 paper proved the old intuition on the symmetry of export and import taxes. In 1934, Lerner provided one of his most remarkable papers laying out the full Pareto-optimality conditions in a general equilibrium production economy - in particular, introducing that all-important Paretian rule for efficiency, i.e. that price equal marginal cost, P = MC. It was here too that Lerner presented the idea of ""degree of monopoly"" as being captured by the extent of deviation of price from marginal cost. Partly as a result of this major contribution to Paretian theory, he joined Oskar Lange in the ""Socialist Calculation"" debate (1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1944). Lerner stressed the importance of achieving efficiency by the P = MC rule, and that these could be achieved by socialism or free markets. He stressed that as a result, only the initial distribution of income is at the discretion of the social planner, the resulting allocation can only be as efficient as in a perfectly competitive market economy. Lerner was convinced of the beauty and efficiency of the Paretian general equilibrium system - but sober enough to realize that it was an idealization and rarely attained - thus, the case for socialism. However, he was not too doctrinaire about it: Lerner believed in economic democracy, the importance of consumer choice, and argued that private enterprise should take over any particular industry in a socialist economy if it proved to be more efficient. Lerner was opposed to waste - misallocation of resources was waste, but a far greater waste was unemployment. In 1936, Lerner wrote one of the first and most remarkable review of Keynes's General Theory, providing a remarkable closure to Keynes's system which he took up again later in 1939 and 1952. His analysis of investment and savings in Keynes (1937, 1938, 1939, 1944) were elucidating, particularly in solving the liquidity preference-loanable funds debate then raging and advancing the theory of investment considerably by clarifying the concept of user cost of capital and showing the relationship between the marginal productivity of capital and the marginal efficiency of investment (1936-7, 1943, 1953). Perhaps of greater lasting impact was his development of the principles of ""functional finance"" (1941, 1943, 1944, 1948, 1951, 1961, 1973), which argued that government policy should be designed to obtain full employment output and price stability regardless of whether it increased or decreased public debt. He was an effective debunker of the the idea of the ""burden of the debt"" and ""crowding out"" arguments commonly used against deficit spending. Lerner's propositions initially shocked even John Maynard Keynes himself - although he eventually embraced them fully.  As Keynes wrote, ""[Lerner's] argument is impeccable, but heaven help anyone who tries [to] put it across to the plain man at this stage of the evolution of our ideas."" (Keynes to Meade, April 1943). His work on trade, welfare, socialism and Keynesian theory culminated in his magnum opus, The Economics of Control (1944). The older themes were integrated and laid out afresh - particularly the efficiency rules and his principles of functional finance. In this book, new ideas were broached: he introduced the idea of counter-speculation in foreign exchange markets as government policy combined with flexible exchange rates, the ""Marshall-Lerner"" conditions for stability in international trade, the idea of an ""optimal currency area"" and, perhaps most famously, his ""optimal distribution of income"", which made use of the ""equal ignorance"" assumption to argue that equal distribution of income is optimal - a proposition which led to a dispute with Milton Friedman. From 1944 on, Lerner began to move away from pure economic theory and towards economic policy. A few exceptions must be mentioned - notably, the 1952 paper on the closure of Keynes's theory and an attempt at a remarkable ""synthesis"" of microeconomics and macroeconomics in a bold 1962 paper. Another major exception was his remarkable work on inflation. Lerner was perhaps the first to recognize the importance of accounting for inflation in Neo-Keynesian theory and laid out his analysis in a remarkable series of articles and books (1944, 1947, 1949, 1951, 1972). In particular, he introduced the concept of ""seller's inflation"", a generalized form of ""cost-push"" inflation which was to become central to Sidney Weintraub and Post Keynesian economics. In his analysis of inflation, Lerner was quite ahead of his time: he recognized the possibility of stagflation, the unemployment-inflation trade-off of the Phillips Curve, what he called ""high full employment"" (a predecessor of the Friedman's natural rate of unemployment), the differential effects of expected and unexpected inflation and the theory of implicit contracts long before any of these concepts were discussed elsewhere. Lerner was bubbling over in novel policy proposals. For instance, his analysis of inflation led to an early advocacy of incomes policies (1947) and, later, his remarkable ""Market Anti-Inflation Plan"" (MAP, 1980). Heuristically, MAP proposes to ""internalize"" the costs of inflation by setting up a type of voucher system whereby a firm obtains a surplus voucher to increase sales if sales in that year fall before a particular aggregate target, while a firm whose sales growth exceeds the target will incur a deficit voucher.  The rattlesnake juice comes with the market part of it: if a firm wishes to raise sales above target regardless, then it can buy surplus vouchers on the open market from firms who are selling below target.  This extension of the marketplace to the very process of inflation, Lerner argued, would not only internalize the externalities of inflation but also be an effective way of controlling aggregate demand without losing the individual dynamism of entrepreneurial activity. As can be gathered from this (partial) list of contributions, it is shameful that an economist who contributed so much to the arsenal of economics should nonetheless have been condemned to roam in the professional underground. Any one of his contributions should easily have earned him a Nobel Prize, and the sum total of them earned him the recognition as one of the most remarkable economists of the century. But to the staid professionals of academia, Lerner was simply not ""one of us"": he must have struck a Bohemian impression: a peripatetic, bearded academic with open-toed sandals, open collars, and a penchant for mobiles who once went to Mexico to convince Leon Trotsky of the fundamental changes that had to be made to his doctrines in light of the Keynesian Revolution. However poor a salesman, Lerner was a sharp and relentless logician, highly creative in both his theoretical and policy analysis. He treated economics as an art form and was certainly one of the greatest masters of it.      Major works of Abba P. Lerner     Resources on Abba P. Lerner   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Leonard de Leys (Lessius), 1554-1623,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lessius.htm," 16th C. Belgian scholastic associated with the Salamanca School. Lenaert Leys or Leonard de Leys (better known as Lessius) was a Belgian Jesuit scholar, student of Jesuit polemicist Robert Bellarmine and subsequently professor of theology at the Catholic University of Louvain.  A prolific writer and pioneering natural philosopher, Lessius eschewed the Scholastic method of argumentation from authority, and deployed common sense and practical experience in his writings. During the 1580s, Lessius made a name for himself by entering into the fray over the conciliation of the doctrines of divine grace and human free will, against his Louvain colleague Baius (founding spirit of the Jansenists).  Lessius took up a theological position similar to that later more clearly articulated by his contemporary Luis de Molina, and secured the condemnation of Baius's doctrines as crypto-Calvinist heresy.  But Lessius soon found himself accused of the Pelagian heresy (overemphasizing human free will at the cost of divine grace). Lessius was exonerated in 1588, the same year Molina's own thesis came out and the same strife run was through once more. Lessius principal claim to fame is his De justitia et jure (1605), a wide-ranging treatise touching on political and economic matters, that is similar in title and content, to that of Luis Molina.  Like Molina and the Salamanca School, Lessius discards much of what passed for Scholastic economic doctrines, notably the just price theory, in favor a 'natural value' doctrine based on the free interchange in markets. Lessius however was more deeply informed of economic matters than his Spanish counterparts - no accident, as Lessius resided near Antwerp, which had been, through much of the16th C., the paramount commercial and financial center of Europe.  Lessius took a deep interest in the economic life of Antwerp and worked his observations, particularly on finance and insurance, into his writings.  As a result, Lessius treatise was became highly popular among merchants and princes interested in economic affairs.

He was subsequently a teacher at various high schools (lycées), during which Levasseur composed his monumental history of the French working classes, which opened his way to entering the Collège de France in 1868 and election to the Académie des sciences morales et politique that same year.  In 1872,  Émile Levasseur became professor of geography, history and statistics at the Collège de France, succeeding to the chair of Alfred Baudrillart.

He was active in the establishment of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce in 1849.  He enrolled at Lincoln's Inn and was called to the bar in 1859.  In 1850, Levi published a comprehensive treatise on Commercial Law of the World (reprinted under a different title in 1863) establishing himself as an authority on the subject.   He was a principle impetus behind the efforts to harmonize English, Scottish and Irish commercial law in 1856, and a tireless (but fruitless) crusader for the development of an international commercial code. In 1852, at popular request, Leone Levi was appointed to lecture in commercial law at King's College London. In 1855, after converting yet again, this time to Anglicanism, Levi was appointed to the Chair in Political Economy, which had been left vacant since the departure of Richard Jones twenty years earlier.  With the creation of the Tooke Chair at KCL in 1859, Levi would continue as professor of commerce. A free trader by instinct and evidence, Levi was also a master collector and deployer of statistics in economic arguments (allegedly, some friends jested, to make up for his heavy Italian accent and shaky command of the English language). Levi was quite active in the Statistical Society of London, and helped it establish its quarters at King's College.  He received an honorary doctorate from the university of Tubingen.

Francis (nee Franz) Lieber's early life reads like that of a Byronic hero of the Romantic era.  Born in Berlin, Prussia, Lieber's father was a merchant who had been ruined during the Napoleonic wars.  At the tender age of fifteen, Lieber interrupted his medical studies at a gymnasium in Berlin and joined his two brothers in enlisting in the Prussian army.  Lieber fought in the final great battles of the Napoleonic wars, and was twice wounded.  After the war, Lieber resumed his studies in Berlin, but they did not last long.   Politically active in the student liberal movement, Lieber was arrested in 1819 by the Prussian authorities and barred from studying at any university in Prussia.  As a result, Lieber skipped over the border and enrolled at the University of Jena (in Saxe-Weimar), obtaining his doctoral degree in 1820.   He attempted to continue his studies in Halle (Prussia), but tight police surveillance led him to take refuge in Dresden (Saxony) instead.  But he did not stay long there.  Shortly after the outbreak of the Greek Revolt in 1821, Lieber set off for Marseilles, to join a company of Philhellenes for Greece.   Lieber stayed in Greece for the early months of 1822 (Lieber's recollections of his time in Greece would be published in 1823 Tagebuch).  Escaping from the Turkish siege of Missolonghi, Lieber secured passage to Italy, and eventually found his way to Rome.  He spent the remainder of 1822-23 in Rome, Italy, employed as tutor to the son of the ancient historian Barthold Georg Niebuhr, then serving as Prussian ambassador to the papal court.  After Niebuhr's tenure ended in 1823, Lieber returned to Prussia, under a promise of protection, and enrolled again at the University of Halle.  But again that did not last long, and he was soon arrested again in 1824.  While imprisoned at Köpenick, Lieber wrote a short book of poems under a pseudonym. After his release, having had enough of the obnoxious Prussian authorities, Lieber moved to England in 1825.  Lieber spent nearly two years in England, subsisting as a tutor and contributing to German-language periodicals.  Lieber fell in with the philosophical radicals in London, meeting Jeremy Bentham and befriending the young John Stuart Mill.  Nonetheless, Lieber failed to obtain the professorship of German at the newly-created UCL in 1826. Disappointed, Francis Lieber immigrated to the United States in 1827.  Armed with letters of introduction from Niebuhr, Lieber settled in Boston, and spent some time lecturing on history in the public hall circuit.  It here that Lieber undertook the monumental job of editing of the Encyclopaedia Americana, a thirteen-volume work put out in 1829-33, modeled after Encyclopaedia Britannica and the German Conversations-Lexicon of Brockhaus.  Lieber undertook many of the articles himself (notably on Greece, Grotius, Machiavelli and Montesquieu, political science and prisons).  Lieber also undertook translations of several German and French works.  The Encyclopaedia made him a minor celebrity in American intellectual circles.  In 1833, Lieber moved to Philadelphia, where he was placed in charge of setting out the education plan for Girard College, a philanthropic school founded by Stephen Girard, a wealthy Philadelphia banker. In 1835, Francis Lieber was hired as professor of history and political economy at South Carolina College (future USC) in Columbia, SC.  South Carolina had been in disarray since Thomas Cooper resigned in 1833, .and the trustees were looking to rebuild the academic program.  Lieber came in as a compromise candidate.  His ardent embrace of free trade was welcome in South Carolina, but there were suspicions about his religious ambiguity and his stance on slavery, and Lieber had to issue a statement assuring them he was not an abolitionist.  He finally joined the faculty in October, 1935.  Lieber's economics lectures at South Carolina initially departed little from Cooper's, indeed for several years, he used Cooper's 1826 textbook, with its solid diet of British Ricardian economics.   But Lieber himself was not an orthodox Ricardian, deploring the labor theory of value, and preferring the supply-and-demand approach of Jean-Baptiste Say and the French Liberal school.  By 1840, Lieber had dropped Cooper's textbook and began using Say's Treatise for his course instead.  It was supplemented by Lieber's own Essays (1841). Nonetheless, Lieber's passion and principal claim to fame was in political science, which he sought to separate from the other social sciences, as a discipline in its own right.  He wrote several pioneering works in the field - Manual of Political Ethics (1838-39), Legal and Political Hermeneutics (1839) and Civil Liberty and Self-Government (1853). Lieber was granted a pardon from Frederick William IV of Prussia in 1842, and undertook a sojourn to Europe in 1844.  He revisited Berlin, and met with the king himself.  Lieber was offered a position in the Prussian civil service as a prison inspector and university lecturer, but turned it down, finding the political atmosphere in Prussia to be too depressing.  Lieber undertook a second trip to Germany in the Summer 1848, unable to resist the Springtime of the Peoples, and sought to make himself useful to the Frankfurt assembly.  But sensing civil war, Lieber predicted it would end in disaster, and returned to the United States in September, 1848. The political atmosphere in the Antebellum South was hardly more inviting, particularly after Lieber published an 1851 address against secession, which scandalized many locals.  Lieber repeatedly tried to secure a position in a Northeastern university, but they bore no fruit. In 1855, South Carolina College president James H. Thornwell announced his intention to resign.  A majority of trustees, and many alumni, nominated Lieber to replace Thornwell.   But being a public position, Lieber's candidacy was mired by strong opposition from the state's Presbyterian faction, and much hay was made in the public press.  In the end, Lieber was passed over in favor C.F. McCay.  Exhausted and embittered, Lieber resigned from South Carolina College in December 1856, and moved to New York City.  Francis Lieber promptly took up an appointment as professor of history and political science at Columbia College in New York in May 1857.  Lieber was an enthusiast for the German-style university curriculum, with its focus on modern sciences.  Lieber had been one of the moving figures behind the foundation of NYU in 1831, and had been repeatedly consulted by Columbia in 1853-56 in its own curricular reform efforts.  Although the Lieber plan was not adopted in its entirety,. Columbia created the chair especially for him.  Lieber taught modern history, political philosophy, political economy, international law, civil and common law for the senior students, and ancient and medieval history for the junior students.  Lieber continued to use Say's Treatise for his senior economics section, and greatly expanded the number of course hours dedicated to economics. The run-up to the Civil War energized Francis Lieber, and he founded the Loyal Publication Society, to put out tracts for the unionist cause (authoring several of them himself).  After the war broke out, Lieber was frequently consulted by the War Department in Washington DC on matters of the laws of war.  In 1862, Lieber wrote out a brief on guerilla warfare, and in 1863, composed the code of war that would be adopted as General Orders No.100 (Apr 24, 1863) by the United States Army.  Nonetheless, the US Civil War was personally tragic - while his two younger sons had fought in the Union army, Lieber's eldest son fought for the Confederacy (and died in battle). In the meantime, things were not going well at Columbia.  Traditionalists found the changes all very dizzying, soon began to roll back the curricular reforms.  In 1865, incoming president Barnard finally abolished Lieber's chair, and subsumed history and political economy back with English literature and philosophy.  Lieber stayed on, but was moved to the Law School as professor of constitutional history and public law.  The strictures of the Law School curriculum gave him some room to insert political science in his course on US government and history, but there was no longer any scope for economics. The US Secretary of War, in gratitude for his wartime work, had tried to secure a chair in law at West Point academy for Lieber in 1865, but was unable to secure the appropriations.  Nonetheless,  Lieber served for a while in the War Department, helping organize captured Confederate archives.  From July 1869, Lieber served as umpire on the board of commissioners set up by the US and Mexican governments in 1868 to sort through remaining unresolved claims still lingering from the Guadalupe-Hidalgo treaty of 1848.  Lieber would remain in this position until his death.  Lieber died in October 1872.  At the time of his death, Lieber was planning a monumental work on the US Constitution, but only fragments remain.  Lieber's chair at Columbia Law was held by a succession of temporary appointments, until 1876, when John W. Burgess was elected to fill a new chair in history, political science and international law.  Burgess would take up and complete the reforms that Lieber had begun, by launching Columbia's School of Political Science (SPS) in 1880, with the blessing of the now-repentant president Barnard.

Erik Lindahl, 1891-1960.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lindahl.htm," Probably the most theoretically rigorous member of the Stockholm School, Erik Robert Lindahl was the only member of that group who stayed wholly within academia. Erik Lindhal obtained his degree at University of Lund 1919 and was highly influenced by Knut Wicksell (although Wicksell had already left Lund, he helped oversee Lindahl's thesis).  Lindahl stayed on as a instructor at Lund until 1924, when he moved to Uppsala.  He finally obtained a full chair at the Gothenburg Business School in 1932, but abandoned it to take up Wicksell's old chair at Lund in 1939 (succeeding Somarin).  Lindahl moved on again three years later,  to take the chair at the University of Uppsala in 1942 (succeeding Brock), where he would remain until his retirement in 1958. Lindahl's contributions to economic theory extend beyond his Wicksellian roots to anticipate much of what is contained in modern Neo-Walrasian equilibrium theory. Lindahl's formulation of the concept of sequence economies and intertemporal equilibrium (1929, 1930) is by far the first rigorous attempt to do so. Lindahl's couching of a theory of capital (1929, 1939) in intertemporal terms anticipates Malinvaud's (1953) famous attempt.   The transfer of Lindahl's concepts to the anglophone world was accomplished by two of his most ardent supporters, John Hicks (1939, 1965) and Friedrich Hayek (1941). Since then, his work on ""sequence analysis"" has been given greater emphasis since the work of Frank Hahn (1973) and Roy Radner (1972).  Lindahl's 1919 solution to the pricing of public goods is another noticeable achievement, brought into modern economic by Duncan Foley (1970).

Simon Nicolas Henri Linguet, 1736-1794. ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/linguet.htm," Simon Nicolas Henri Linguet was a celebrated 18th Century French lawyer (he only lost two cases in his career), sometime historian and bombastic journalist who's principal claim to fame is as an irascible opponent of the Enlightenment philosophers and economists.  Linguet was not a knee-jerk supporter of the Ancien regime -- having indeed fallen foul of it on several occasions and was a personal friend to Voltaire  But Linguet's consistently contrarian stance against reformist doctrines, his embrace of a romantic absolutism, earned Linguet the label of a ""reactionary"", the ""advocate of Neros, sultans and viziers"", as Mirabeau would call him.  But others -- like Karl Marx -- proudly regarded Linguet as something of an early socialist. Overall, Linguet was more of a destructive than constructive thinker.  It would not be unfair to regard him as an 18th Century French version of England's own 19th Century specimen, Thomas Carlyle, whom he closely resembled both in doctrine and in tone. Born in Rheims, Linguet was educated at the College de Beauvais in Paris, where his father had been assistant principal. After a sojourn in Poland in the service of the Count Palatine of Zweibrucken,  Linguet returned to Paris in 1751 and quickly fell in with the philosophes.  However, he was soon disgusted by what he perceived to be their petty cliqueishness, their fraudulent poses and self-serving reforms. After a quarrel with d'Alembert in 1762, Linguet declared war on the Enlightenment, directing his acerbic pen and his court-honed debating skills against them. Linguet began with cannonades against the philosophes (1764) and their darling icon Montesquieu (1767, 1774). The Theorie des Loix (1767), perhaps Linguet's most serious effort, builds up a defense of absolutism on the contention that society lives off the destruction of liberty. As Karl Marx put it, ""Linguet wrecked Montesquieu's illusory esprit des lois with a single word: the esprit des lois is property.""  In 1771, Linguet directed his sarcastic wit against the Physiocrats, denouncing them as a sect, ridiculing their doctrines, poking fun at Quesnay's Tableau,  that ""ridiculous hieroglyph"", which he reprinted alongside Confucius's Y-King, to demonstrate how both are ""equally incomprehensible"".  The Tableau, Linguet contended, was ""an insult to common sense, to reason, to philosophy, with its columns of figures of reproduction nette terminating always in a zero, striking symbol of the fruit of the researches of any one simple enough to try in vain to understand it."" (Linguet, 1771; as quoted in Higgs). In 1775, the Abbé Morellet wrote a feeble reply to Linguet's attacks, but that only encouraged him.  Linguet's Theorie du Libelle (1775) dismantled Morellet and took the opportunity to launch into yet another venomous tirade against the Physiocrats. Predictably, the increasing range of Linguet's caustic attacks began hitting fellow-lawyers and he was disbarred in 1775.  Undaunted, Linguet turned to journalism, founding the Journal de politique et de litterature, as a vehicle for his romanticized despotism and against would-be social reformers.  But he overreached himself again and an attack on the French Academy prompted the government to intervene.  Linguet was forced to cede the Journal to La Harpe and go to exile in London in 1776. But Linguet would not be silenced. From London, in 1777, Linguet launched a new journal, the Annales politiques, civiles, et litteraires du dix-huitieme siecle, in collaboration with Jacques Mallet du Pan, and continued his sarcastic assaults on the sacred cows of French intelligentsia and the French government.  The Annales was, of course, a scandalous hit.  The Physiocrats were targeted once again by his pen in a 1778 Annales article. After a brief stay in Brussels, Linguet returned to Paris in 1779 but was quickly in trouble again.  For an attack on the Duke of Duras, Linguet was arrested in 1780 and thrown into the Bastille (he would publish a memoir of his stay there in 1783).   Mallet du Pan would continue the Annales in his absence.  After his release from the Bastille in 1783, Linguet returned to exile in London and, once again, soon found himself in Brussels. Breaking with Du Pan, Linguet relaunched the Annales politiques on his own (Mallet du Pan's publication being renamed Memoirs historiques in 1783 and annexed to the Mercure de France)  While in Brussels, Linguet was rewarded with a pension and title of nobility by the Austrian Emperor Joseph II, for supporting him in his reforms and in the Scheldt affair (the repudiation of the Barrier Treaty). Linguet returned to France in 1786 in the capacity of an Austrian official and immediately sued the former minister of foreign affairs, the Duke of Aiguillon, for back legal fees.  Picked up as a favorite by the French Queen Marie Antoinette (sister of his benefactor, Joseph II), Linguet enjoyed a brief celebrity in the halls of power, rivaling Beaumarchais for eminence.   With the opening of the Estates-General in 1789, Linguet bombarded the French public with a series of pamphlets ridiculing the pretensions of the reformers, taking particular aim at the Count of Mirabeau (estranged son of the Physiocrat, Marquis de Mirabeau). He had a few cranky proposals of his own -- not least of which was that the French state should simply repudiate the public debt (Etienne Claviere's response to this would include one of the earliest uses of the term ""capitalist"").  In one of his few non-reactionary moments, Linguet undertook a special journey to Vienna to plead for the Brabantine rebels. Linguet returned to Paris in 1791 to personally defend the interests of Santo Domingo in the National Assembly.  He also put up a strong defense of Louis XVI.  Linguet fled Paris in 1793 to escape the Terror, but was soon arrested and charged with flattering despots and referring to bread as a ""slow poison"".  Indeed, it was ultimately for slandering the ""nutrition of the people"" that Linguet was condemned to death and executed by guillotine in 1794.   On an interesting aside, it has been alleged that Claude Chappe stole the design for his electrical telegraph from notes written by Linguet.

Friedrich List, 1789-1846.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/list.htm,"  Friedrich List was a nationalist/romantic critic of economic theory and one of the forefathers of the German Historical School. Born in Reutlingen, the son of a tanner, Friedrich List followed a career as an clerk, accountant and bureaucrat in the Kingdom of Württemberg, rising quickly in the administrative ranks and eventually gaining the ear of influential politicians.  Despite his lack of formal education, Friedrich List was appointed professor of cameralistics at the University of Tübingen in 1817, but lost his job in 1819, when his ministerial patrons lost theirs. He never regained a teaching post. List promptly entered politics, and became a liberal member of the Württemburg legislature.  On the chamber floor, List was an advocate of the customs union but even more vocal on administrative reforms.  But his political views ruffled feathers, and in 1822, List was expelled from the chamber, and put on trial on charges of sedition.  List escaped from Württemburg before the sentence could be implemented.  List subsequently wandered around, spending time in Strasbourg, Baden, Paris, London and Basel.  List was re-captured while on a family visit to Stuttgart in 1824. List eventually reached an agreement with the authorities, was went into exile in the United States in 1825. After arriving in the United States, List worked as a journalist for a Germany-language newspaper in Pennsylvania for several years. He came under the influence of protectionists of the ""American System"", like Henry Clay and the Careys.  List soon shifted his earlier economic views away from free trade, and published a local tract (in English) in 1827 that was well-received. Friedrich List returned to Germany in 1834, in the capacity of US consul in Leipzig (Saxony).  List continue writing and promoting his ideas. List was an enthusiastic supporter and one of the main architects of the German customs union (Zollverein) and an early enthusiast and advocate for the establishment of railroads throughout Germany.  His own involvement in railroad schemes in Saxony, however, ruined him financially. List's death in 1846 was an apparent suicide. Friedrich List is best known for his The National System of Political Economy (1841).  It was written against the free-trade doctrines that permeated Classical economics. However, List's thesis was not merely a polemical defense of protectionism.  List couched his argument on the basis of his analysis of economics, which stressed political factors - notably, the ""nation"" - in economics. List argued that it was the government's responsibility to foster the ""productive powers"" of a nation and, once these were in place, then free trade could ensue, but not before. This is akin to the modern ""infant industry"" argument for protection. Also relevantly, List developed a theory of economic ""stages"" which was to serve as a blueprint for the later German Historical School.

I.M.D. Little's exploded on to the economics scene with his widely-diffused 1950 tract, A Critique of Welfare Economics. In it, Little tore apart the welfare theories of Hicks and Kaldor and, in a way, paved the way for rise of social choice theory. This Oxford philosopher-turned-economist subsequently moved on to development economics in the latter phases of his career.

Hubert Llewellyn Smith, 1864-1945.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/llewellyn.htm," British labor economist, statistician and civil servant. H. Llewellyn Smith was educated at Bristol and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, taking a double first in mathematics and beating out L.L. Price and Edwin Cannan for the Cobden prize in 1886. Placing second in the civil service examination, Llewellyn Smith was offered a post in the War Office, which he declined on account of his Quaker faith.  Instead, in 1887-8, he took up a position lecturing on political economy for the Oxford University Extension and Toynbee Trust in East London.

It was while he was in East London that Llewellyn Smith joined the team of researchers (which included Beatrice Potter) around Charles Booth, who would produce the massive study of working class conditions and urban poverty in Life and Labour of the People (published in seventeen volumes between 1891 and 1903).  Partly on the strength of this work, in 1893, when the Labour Department was created under the Board of Trade, H. Llewellyn Smith was appointed its first commissioner, reporting directly to the commissioner-general Robert Giffen.  He would succeed Giffen as controller-general in 1897 and follow a distinguished career in the civil service, becoming permanent secretary of the department until 1919, when he was appointed Chief Economic Advisor of His Majesty's Government (1919-1927).  He compiled and produced the massive New Survey of London working life in the 1930s.        Major Works of H. Llewellyn Smith     Resources on  H. Llewellyn Smith   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

William F. Lloyd, 1795-1852.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lloyd.htm," William Forster Lloyd was a fellow of the Royal Society and successively lecturer in Greek, mathematics and political economy at Oxford.  Lloyd succeeded Richard Whately as Drummond Chair at Oxford in 1832 and can be justly regarded as a member of the Oxford-Dublin school of British proto-Marginalists.  William F. Lloyd was the son of Thomas Lloyd, rector of Aston-sub-Edge, Gloucestershire.  More significantly, W.F. Lloyd was the younger brother of the powerful Charles Lloyd, Regius Professor of Divinity and Bishop of Oxford (until his death in 1829).  In the early 1800s, while a fellow at Christ Church, Charles Lloyd had been the tutor of the famous British statesman Sir Robert Peel.  W.F. Lloyd was educated at the prestigious Westminster School and entered his brother's college, Christ Church, in 1812. He received his B.A. in 1815, with a first in mathematics and second in classics.  He stayed on, receiving his M.A. in 1818 and went on to be ordained as an Anglican cleric (although he was never appointed to a position).  William F. Lloyd's subsequent biographical details are scant.  It is known that in 1823, Lloyd was appointed reader in Greek, and then briefly lecturer in mathematics in 1823-24 at Christ Church, but he disappears off the radar thereafter.  In 1830, his first published work suddenly emerged, an empirical study of historical corn prices.  The next he is heard of is in 1832, when Lloyd was elected Drummond Professor of Political Economy at Oxford, succeeding Richard Whately who had resigned in 1831 to take up the position of Archbishop of Dublin.  The choice of Lloyd is puzzling.  There is no indication that Whately (or the prior holder Senior) knew Lloyd or had any role in the choice of his successor (indeed, Whately left Oxford under something of a cloud). 

Lloyd's first lectures were delivered in the fall of 1832, and subsequently published in 1833.

In his first series of lectures delivered at Oxford (1833) on population, Lloyd followed Senior in delving into the debates on Malthusian population dynamics that were then rocking the Classical school. Lloyd tried to understand the causes of high fertility rate among the poor.  He honed in on the precarious state of the male laborer. The uncertainty of employment and costs of living, an outcome of the business fluctuations of the industrial age, contributed to his lack of prudence. The industrial employment of women and children also weakened the traditional responsibility of male wage-earners.  But children were an asset and, being cheaper, often more readily employable by industry and thus a form of insurance against unemployment of the parents.   But in pre-industrial ages, where industrial fluctuations are rare, and among the middle classes, where employment and the prospect of advancement are more secure, fertility naturally declines.  Contrary to Malthus, Lloyd asserted, fertility wasn't merely a ""bad habit"" but had elements of necessary, rational calculation. Exhorting ""moral restraint"" in such a climate, Lloyd concluded, was foolhardy. In the same lecture, W.F. Lloyd introduced the famous  parable of the ""Tragedy of the Commons"".  Lloyd observed that when a pasture field (the ""commons"") is available to all, individual cattle-owners have a short-term interest in increasing the size of their herds.  But, unchecked, the size of the herds on the commons will soon exceed its carrying capacity.  The commons will be doomed by overgrazing.  The argument was used by Lloyd to dispute Adam Smith's idea of the ""invisible hand"", that individual self-interest coincided with the common good. (Although some modern economists argue that Lloyd's paradox can be ""solved"" by assigning private property rights to the field).  But W.F. Lloyd's chief claim to fame is as perhaps the earliest anticipator of the Neoclassical theory of value.  In his (second) series of lectures at Oxford on the Notion of Value,  Lloyd introduced the concept of diminishing marginal utility:  ""Let us suppose the case of a hungry man having one ounce, and only ounce of food, at his command.  To him, this ounce is obviously of very great importance.  Suppose him now to have two ounces.  These are still of great importance; but the importance of the second is not equal to that of the single ounce.  In other words, he would not suffer so much from parting with one of his two ounces, retaining one for himself, as he would suffer, when he had only one ounce, by parting with that one, and so retaining none...Thus while he is scantily supplied with food, he holds the given portion of it in great esteem -- in other words, he sets a great value on it; when his supply is increased, his esteem for a given quantity is lessened, or, in other words, he sets a less value on it.""  Lloyd proceeds to distinguish total from marginal utility, calling the former ""abstract utility"" and the latter ""special utility"".   Lloyd connects this notion with value: ""in its ultimate sense, value undoubtedly signifies a feeling of the mind which shows itself always at the margin of separation between satisfied and unsatisfied wants."" However, Lloyd's work, like much of the rest of the Oxford-Dublin school did not have much of an impact on contemporaries,  He was really only rediscovered as late as 1903 by E.R.A. Seligman. Lloyd was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1834.  Lloyd lived on his property in Buckinghamshire, until his death on 2 June, 1852.      Major Works of William F. Lloyd     Resources on W.F.

John Locke, 1632-1704.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/locke.htm," Prominent empiricist philosopher, natural law social thinker and Whig political theorist, John Locke was nonetheless a rather traditional Mercantilist in his economics. John Locke was born in Wrington (near Bristol), to a family of petty gentry of Puritan religious convictions. His father had served as a captain in the parliamentary army during the English Civil War of the 1640s. and subsequently became a lawyer and jurisconsult for local Somerset magistrates.  After finishing school at Westminster, John Locke enrolled at Christ Church College, Oxford in 1652, where he would remain for the next fifteen years. Locke studied classics, philosophy and medicine, earning his B.A. in 1656 and his MA in 1659.  Although he had been a quiet, unremarkable student, Locke was nonetheless appointed lecturer in Greek at Christ Church from 1660.  A special royal dispensation from Charles II allowed Locke to stay on at Oxford beyond the prescribed terms without ordination. In 1663, Locke was elected censor in natural philosophy.   Locke acquired a passion for medicine, and studied it independently from 1658.  Through it, he came into the circle of the chemistry pioneer Robert Boyle, and his clique of ""experimental"" scientists at Oxford.  Although he was initially denied a degree in medicine at Oxford, Locke nonetheless made something of a name for himself as a physician, and would eventually be elected to the Royal Society in 1668. Locke's future path was changed by his fateful meeting in June, 1666 with Anthony Ashley Cooper (future Earl of Shaftesbury, Whig political  leader and grandfather of the utilitarian).  Ashley had come to Oxford to seek a water cure for a liver ailment, and was struck by Locke, and hired him on the spot as his personal physician (Locke would go on to perform a novel surgical procedure on Ashley's liver that apparently cured the ailment).  From 1667, Locke lived in Ashley's household at Exeter House on the Strand in London.  Ashley was, at this time, at the height of his political power.  As the powerful chancellor of the exchequer, Ashley formed part of the small clique (known as ""the Cabal"") that dominated the government under King Charles II of Great Britain.  Ashley was a proprietor of Carolina Colony in America and an ardent Mercantilist, ready to promote any cause that furthered England's trading interests. Seeing the Dutch Republic as England's greatest threat, Ashley made a famous war-mongering speech in parliament, comparing England to Rome and Holland to Carthage (and ""Delenda Carthago est"").  Ashley reached his peak in 1672, when he was granted the title of first Earl of Shaftesbury and raised to first lord of trade and lord chancellor of England. Although Locke was primarily Ashley-Shaftesbury's physician, he imbibed the political atmosphere of the Shaftesbury home, and soon became his secretary and informal advisor.  Locke authored several unpublished political memoranda for Ashley-Shaftesbury, notably his Essay on Toleration (1667) and his Constitution for Carolina (1669). Around 1668, John Locke also authored his first economics piece, a memo to Shaftesbury on Sir Josiah Child's recent 1668 proposal to lower the interest rate from 6 to 4 percent.  Although unpublished, the memo would form the basis for Locke's later economic works.  Locke also got deeply involved in the practical issues of commerce and colonial development. When Shaftesbury combined the boards of commerce and colonies under his presidency, Locke was appointed as secretary to the Council of Trade and Plantations.  That same year, Locke joined Shaftesbury as one of the eleven investors in the ""Company of Adventurers to Bahamas"", proprietors of the English colony of the Bahamas (which included several slave plantations).    Along with the rest of the Cabal, Shaftesbury fell from power in late 1673.  But he soon re-emerged in the House of Lords as the leader of the Whig opposition to the Crown.  With his patron now an outsider, Locke's days were numbered.  When the Council of Trade and Plantations was split up in 1675, Locke resigned his position and returned to Oxford.  This time around, Locke secured his BA in medicine and a license to practice medicine.  But he did not stay in Oxford for long, and, in the capacity of a tutor, went abroad to France for three years. After several years of political tussle, Charles II brought Shaftesbury back into the Privy Council in 1679, in the hopes that might tame him.  But Shaftesbury insisted on spearheading the parliamentary effort to exclude Charles II's brother James, Duke of York, from the succession to the throne on account of James being a Roman Catholic. Shaftesbury and the Whigs demanded that Charles II raise up his illegitimate Protestant son, James Scott, Duke of Monmouth, as the new heir to the throne. Having returned from France in 1679, Locke re-connected with Shaftesbury, but with the ""exclusion bill"" crisis at its height, Locke wisely realized he ought to keep his distance from the political fray.  Locke remained quietly at Oxford, apparently aloof from afar, but in reality was knee-deep involved in providing the arguments for Shaftesbury's political challenge to the crown.  It is believed that Locke composed his Two Treatises on Government during this time. His first treatise, written c.1681, addressed the ""divine right of kings"" argument that had recently been promoted in a book by Sir Robert Filmer.  His more famous second treatise, composed either in 1679 or 1683 (historians are divided), articulated Locke's famous thesis on natural law, property and government by consent.  Neither treatise was published at the time.  In 1681, Shaftesbury was arrested and charged with treason.  Although acquitted at his trial, Shaftesbury promptly went into exile into Holland. Locke had kept enough distance to not be dragged into it.  But a couple of years later, in 1683, several prominent Whigs were implicated in the Rye House Plot to place Monmouth on the throne by force.  While it is unclear that such a plot even existed, the crown nonetheless used it to persecute opponents.  Locke realized he was under suspicion, and decided it was time to go.  Locke fled to Holland in 1683, where he would remain under an assumed name for the next six years.  Politically wary, John Locke was never very keen to publish his ideas, or sign his name to them.  It was only in the late 1680s, when he was already in his fifties, that Locke published his first works in Jean le Clerc's Bibliothèque universelle.  It included Locke's reviews of Boyle's medical treatise (1686) and Newton's Principia (1688) (and some others which cannot be certainly attributed). Of his original compositions, Locke published an article on commonplace books (1688), and an abridged first draft of his essay on human understanding.(1688). In late 1688, the Dutch prince William of Orange invaded England, and the Stuart monarch James II fled to France.  In February 1689, the British parliament declared the throne vacant and acclaimed William and his English wife as king William III and Mary II of Great Britain.  At their coronation, William and Mary were read a ""Bill of Rights"" drafted by Parliament, and subsequently passed into law, effectively establishing England as a constitutional monarchy.  Locke left Holland and arrived in England on the same boat that carried Mary II - and brought along piles of manuscripts he had been writing during his exile.  Locke's Letter on Toleration, defending religious toleration, appeared in late 1689.   The letter had been originally written in 1685, in the aftermath of the French king's revocation of the Edict of Nantes (withdrawing toleration from Protestant Huguenots), and draws on many of the arguments first outlined by Locke back in his 1667 essay.  Locke had originally written his new  letter in Latin to a Dutch friend, who had it published (without Locke's permission) in Gouda, Holland  in  early 1689.  There were French and Dutch translations before an unauthorized English translation (by the Unitarian merchant William Popple) appeared later in the fall of 1689 (after parliament had already passed the act of toleration).  In his original 1667 essay, Locke had argued that intolerance was unreasonable as government policy - the nature of human belief is such that a person cannot really control his own beliefs, much less an outsider compelling his belief by force, even if they manage to achieve outward compliance.  Moreover, it falls outside the scope of government magistrates, whose sole mandate is to ensure the peace.  His 1689 Letter goes beyond government policy to address tolerance by people in general for other people.  Echoing his new ideas of a voluntary social commonwealth, Locke asserts that men do not enter into civil society in order to save their souls or have their beliefs designated by others.  And if that responsibility is not assigned to civil society, then it is not assigned to magistrates.  Moreover, even if it was possible to compel belief by force (which it is not, be assuming it is), it would nonetheless be an evil, and detrimental to the very religion one is trying to promote.  If it is right for the English State to impose the ""true"" Christian religion on people of different sects or faiths, then generalizing, it is no less right for the French state to impose Catholicism, or Muslim states to impose Islam, in theirs.  Religion would be diminished to an accident of the country of birth and not conviction, and would be detrimental to the advance of ""true"" Christianity.  Locke goes on to explain how magistrates are human and have no competence on religion, that churches are and should be regarded as voluntary associations,  and that even apparently minor impositions, such as forcing as High Church ceremonies on Low Church sects, are outside his jurisdiction.  Compelling men to act even outwardly against their judgment and sincere beliefs is an evil in itself.  Outward compliance only works on the irreligious who don't care either way, and fills the church with hypocrites, while causing pointless suffering to sincere believers.  Locke allows exceptions where intolerance may be justified - e.g. if following a particular religious sect has civil consequences, like any ordinary crime e.g.  if religious adherence requires allegiance to foreign powers, or the overthrow of the government (clearly here Locke has Roman Catholics in mind).  Locke's letter provoked a  critique from the High Church Anglican minister Jonas Proast of Oxford.  Proast agreed that compulsion of belief was silly, but ""moderate"" force may nonetheless be a useful tool to ""inform"" those who would otherwise never come across the ""true"" religion.  Locke replied with his Second Letter (1690).  Proast responded with a Third Letter in 1691, prompting Locke to write his own massive Third Letter (1692).  A dozen years would pass before Proast published his reply to Locke (confusingly called Second Letter in 1704), to which Locke drafted a rejoinder in his Fourth Letter (1704, unfinished).   Locke also published (albeit anonymously) his Two Treatises on Government in 1690..  It was a pathbreaking classic of natural law and political philosophy.  It had its roots partly in Locke's theological meanderings, partly in his political Whiggery during the exclusion crisis.  At its center is Locke's theory of property, namely, that property rights are determined by labor (""workmanship"").  Locke considers it self-evident that every man has property rights over his own labor, and by extension property rights over what his labor produces.  This is mirrored in the Divine, that all men are created by God, and belong to God (not to other men), and that the earth and its resources was created by God not for the kings or the few, but for the common benefit of mankind.  Contrary to Hobbes, Locke starts on an assumption that abundance and peace was the state of nature, rather than scarcity and conflict.  As a result, property rights emerged from the fact of labor (Locke uses the famous analogy of how water in the well belongs to all, but the water in the bucket belongs to him who drew it).  He goes on to describe the political commonwealth as a deliberate and conscious creation of men, that men enter into agreements with each other it in order to protect their property rights.  In this respect, he echoes Hobbes - although where Hobbes thought coming under the Leviathan was merely a rational necessity, Locke asserts it was an empirical fact, that such social contracts were made historically.  This leads him to the conclusion that government, being created by men, is owned by the men who constitute civil society. Consequently, the legitimacy of a government, rests on consent of the governed, the extent to which civil society feels it is fulfilling its role, protecting individual and property rights, and retain civil rights to resist tyranny.  Although Locke's treatise is not quite articulating popular sovereignty, it comes quite close.  Locke also emphasizes the vital importance of the separation of powers to keep tyranny at bay.  He enunciates the three political powers as legislative (making laws), executive (executing laws) and federative (military defense).  He does not include the judiciary as a separate branch (that would have to wait until Montesequieu).  Although Locke allows that the executive and the federative might be usefully conducted by the same branch, he is adamant about the importance of separating the legislative from the executive.  Thus Locke's 1690 Two Treatises seemed to many to provide the philosophical underpinnings of the 1688 Glorious Revolution. Then came the Essay on Human Understanding, the only treatise Locke signed his name to.  Although Locke began planning it as early as 1671, he only began actually writing it around 1687, during his stay in Holland (an early draft made it into the Bibliotheque Universelle in 1688).   His time in Holland had been spent in consultation and debate with local philosophers and theologians, and it was  there that Locke became better acquainted with continental European philosophy, notably the rationalist epistemology of Descartes and Spinoza. The full Essay concerning Human Understanding finally appeared in 1690.  In it, Locke articulated an empiricist epistemology, denying the possibility of innate ideas (as the rationalists had argued).  Man, Locke famously asserted, was born a ""blank slate"", and his ideas of the world came primarily from his senses.  Locke's empiricist school of British philosophy would be followed up by George Berkeley and David Hume.  Sir Josiah Child's proposal to lower the rate of interest from 6% to 4% came up again.  The bill was introduced into parliament in November 1691.  Locke dusted off his old memos and hurriedly published his Some Considerations of the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest, in opposition to it.   It had only partial effect - parliament split the difference and agreed to lower it to 5%.  Locke's pamphlet also asked parliament to consider the problems of the state of silver coinage in England.  English coinage had been steadily deteriorating for the past half century.  Because they legally circulated at face value, bad coins (clipped, underweight hammered coins) were the only coins that circulated internally, while good coins (full-weight milled coins) were removed from circulation (either hoarded, melted down or exported abroad).  Locke urged parliament to consider reminting the coinage of the realm, and, in the interim, to adjust the law to allow bad coins to circulate by intrinsic metal content.  His pleas had no effect at the time.   In 1694-95, at the height of the French wars, a sudden crisis of confidence gripped English money-holders, which led to an upsurge in hoarding of good silver and a flight to the gold guinea.  This provoked a tumble in the  value of banknotes of the fledgling Bank of England (f.1694) and  a brief recession. In early 1695, parliament appointed a commission, headed by William Lowndes, to look into the currency problem.  Lowndes' Report recommended reminting to entire coinage of the realm.  But to ease the pain of adjustment (and lighten the government's debt burden), Lowndes also recommended a simultaneous devaluation of the pound - a general depreciation of 25% and the raising the face value of coins.  Locke responded immediately with his Further Considerations (1695). It approved reminting, but denounced Lowndes devaluation scheme, arguing again for the restoration of the old coinage to their intrinsic value to ensure confidence of contract. Locke's argument persuaded the Whig minister Charles Montagu (future Earl of Halifax, then chancellor of the exchequer and a sponsor of the Bank of England).   In November 1695, at Montagu's urging, parliament voted for Locke's scheme rather than Lowndes's.  The entire English coinage was to be re-minted at the old intrinsic metal ratio.  Some £7 million in silver money and £3 million in gold money will be reminted in the course of the next few years. It in his first tract, Some Considerations (1691), where Locke develops his contributions to economic theory. Locke introduces the concept of ""money as convention"" as well as, following Bodin, the main elements of the Quantity Theory of Money, notably the concept of ""velocity"".  Locke saw that the lowering of interest by legal means might very well lead to a collapse in trade because it would not reflect the ""natural scarcity"" of money. If money collapsed, then there would be, alternatively, a collapse in output or prices. The collapse in prices would lead to relatively cheap English goods and relatively expensive foreign ones ""both which will keep us poor"" (Locke, 1691). Unlike Mun, Locke did not see this as a promoter of exports.  Locke's ideas on value are a bit obtuse and inconsistent.  In his 1690 Two Treatises, Locke proposes a quite explicit labor theory of value.  But in his 1691 Some Considerations, Locke seems to adhere to a supply-and-demand-based theory of value. John Law (1705) did much to clarify the confusion between them. Locke also proposed a theory of property in his 1690 Treatises.   The right to property, Locke claims,  is derived from the labor of those who work it.  More specifically, he perceives that as ""labor"" is naturally ""owned"" by the person in whom it is embodied, then consequently anything that labor is applied to, is similarly ""owned"" by the laborer -- a rather proto-Marxian notion.  Locke's ""natural labor theory of property"" stands in stark contrast to that of Hobbes, who conceived of property merely as a State guarantee, and of Grotius, who contended that property emerges from social consent. Locke's ideas on money were in tandem to the English currency crisis of the early 1690s.  For the past half-century, English money-holders had lived comfortably with deteriorated silver coins, but a sudden crisis of confidence related to poor harvests and the Nine-Years' War had led to a sudden flight away from silver and towards gold currency.  The English gold guinea (nominally worth 20 silver shillings) was being traded on the open market at 30 shillings per guinea -- 50% above its face value.  Notes from the fledgling Bank of England were being traded far below par.  The government had concluded that the best route was to remedy the deteriorated state of silver coins and remint the entire coinage of the realm. The question was at what rate. The Secretary of the Treasury, William Lowndes, recommended a simultaneous devaluation of the pound sterling (to ease the pain and lighten the government's debt burden).  But John Locke argued for reminting at the old intrinsic metal value in order to maintain ""confidence"" in debt contracts. With an eye on the foreign (i.e. Dutch) holders of English debt, Parliament ended up adopting Locke's program and, 1696, the entire English coinage was reminted at the old ratio at the extraordinary cost of nearly £7 million.  During this monetary reform, in an effort to stem the flight to gold, the value of the gold guinea had been increased from its earlier face value of 20 silver shillings to its new face value of 22 shillings -- thus the implicit mint ratio was readjusted to 1 unit of gold to 15.9 units silver.  However, gold mining in Brazil had recently taken off, bringing the value of gold in terms of silver on the European market down to the ratio of 1:15.  As the royal mint and market ratios were different, gold poured from Europe into England, while a reverse flow sent silver out. John Locke, who believed that silver (and not gold) was the ""proper"" metal for English currency (""let gold find its own value"", as he put it) went into print again, this time pleading for a further devaluation of the guinea.  Listening to Locke, the English authorities duly reduced the value of a gold guinea to 21s 6d.  It was lowered once more by Newton a little later on.  But the ratio was still too high.  England would remain a gold magnet throughout the next century.        Major Works of John Locke     Resources on John Locke Contemporary Modern   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Peter Lombard, c.1100-1160.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lombard.htm,"Italian Scholastic philosopher from Novara.  A student of Adelard in Paris, went to teach in that city, becoming a professor at the school of Notre Dame and eventually Bishop of Paris.  Peter Lombard's fame rests on his Sentences, a comprehensive summation of Christian doctrine and debates in four books, paraphrasing and quoting freely from the Church fathers, notably St. Augustine. His work was also influenced substantially by his contemporary Gratian. Lombard Sentences would be the primary theology textbook used by Scholastic studies, eclipsing nearly all other books of that kind.   Theology students were frequently known as Sententiari (students of Lombard's Sentences).   A veritable industry of Scholastic summaries and commentaries on Lombard's Sentences was fostered in the course of the 13th C.  Four stand out: the Summa Aurea of William of Auxerre (c.1220), the  Summa universae theologica of Alexander of Hales (c.1245), the Commentaria of Bonaventure (c.1250) and the Summa Theologiae of Thomas Aquinas.  These four do not confine themselves to remarking narrowly on Lombard's text, but rather use the themes and arrangement of the Sentences to guide their own philosophical and theological ventures.

Mountifort Longfield, 1802-1884.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/longfield.htm,"Irish lawyer, judge and the first holder of  the Whately Chair in Political Economy at Trinity College, Dublin.  The son of an Anglican vicar of the same name in Desert McGee County Cork, Ireland. Mountifort Longfield was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, graduating as a gold medallist in science (nt) in 1823.  He was elected a fellow of TCD in 1825.  He was called to the Irish bar in 1828, but did not practice.  In residence, Longfield received his M.A. in 1829, and proceeded to take a law degree, earning his LL.D. in 1831.  The former Oxford economist Richard Whately arrived in late Ireland in 1831, to assume his new position as Archbishop of Dublin.  Whately promptly contacted the directors of  Trinity College, Dublin.with a proposal to endow a chair in political economy on a similar model as the Drummond Chair at Oxford, but with the condition that he (Whately) gets to pick the holder.  The university authorities balked at the intrusion, but after some negotiation, it was agreed that the the university authorities would pick the final name from a short-list of three candidates selected by Whately from a competitive examination.  Despite having no evident background in economics (at the time he was an assistant to Phiilip Crampton, a professor of Medieval English law), Mountiford Longfield submitted to the competitive examinations in July 1832.  His answers evidently pleased Whately, who handpicked Longfield as his candidate.  Mountiford Longfield was inaugurated as the first Whately Professor of Political Economy in October 1832. Mountiford Longfield began delivering his economic lectures in the Fall of 1832..  In 1834,  Longfield was appointed Regius Professor in Feudal and English Law (also at Trinity College Dublin).  Longfield's formally resigned as Whately chair in 1836.  He was succeeded by Isaac Butt. Longfield published nineteen of his Whately lectures - the Lectures on Political Economy (1834), which were the nine lectures he delivered in the Spring and Fall of 1833, were dedicated to value and distribution and are arguably his most theoretically accomplished and original work.    The second set of lectures were the Four Lectures on Poor Laws, delivered in the Spring of 1834 .  The third and final set of lectures (primarily on international trade) were published as Three Lectures on Commerce and One on Absenteeism, were delivered in the Fall of 1834, just before Longfield's resignation. Longfield's lectures were an astounding performance. Longfield presents a an almost complete proto-marginalist theory of value and distribution, in opposition to the Classical Ricardian theory, asserting supply-and-demand as the joint determinants of value.  He also presented a methodological discussion very much in line with Whately's own views. Longfield among the first to recognize that the principle of diminishing marginal productivity applied generally to factors of production.  Also expanded the principle of comparative advantage in international trade to more than the typical ""two-commodity"" case. It is easy to see why Whately picked Longfield - his economics, his methodology and his policy conclusions were very similar to those Whately and Senior had held back at Oxford in previous years, to the point where one cannot help but wonder if Longfield might have received some ""assistance"" from the Archbishop in their composition.  If nothing else, Longfield almost certainly must have read their lectures in advance, thereby beginning the transplantation of the ""Oxford catallactics"" school to Dublin.  Longfield's successors in the Whately chair - notably Isaac Butt (1836),  James A. Lawson (1841) and W. Neilson Hancock (1946) - held similar views to Longfield, and so it is not erroneous to call them collectively  the ""Oxford-Dublin school"" of proto-Marginalists After 1834, Longfield did not spend much time on economics, concentrating on law (Longfield became a Queen's Counsel in 1842).  But there are a few notable exceptions.   In 1840, Longfield published an anonymous series of articles on the banking question in the Dublin University Magazine, coming out with a version of Overstone's ""currency principle"".  He mused over the existence of the trade cycle, and even drew the familiar ""wave"" diagram to illustrate it!  Longfield was one of the founders of the Dublin Statistical Society in 1847 (later the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland). Upon Archbishop Whately's death in 1863, Longfield succeeded as the DSS's second president .  Longfield served (alongside Whately) on the 1852-53 Dublin University Reform Commission At the height of the Irish famine, while serving as Regius professor of English law,  Longfield was appointed to a special government commission to implement the 1849 encumbered estates act, i.e. to oversee the sale and transfer of bankrupted small estates to solvent buyers.  This was a government-sponsored effort to increase the size of farms of Ireland, in the hope this would enable the implementation of agricultural technological improvements and boost productivity.  In 1858, the commission was replaced by a Landed Estates Court, and Longfield was appointed a judge in it.  In 1870, Longfield published an piece via the Cobden Club reviewing the history of land tenure in Ireland, and recommending a a scheme for fixed ten-year tenures or ""tenant rights"", which would, in case of eviction,  require a landlord to reimburse the evicted tenant for the unutilized period and compensate him for any past improvements.  Longfield's scheme was debated in parliament, but the final Land Act of 1870 limited the cases where it could be claimed. Longfield's final contribution to economics was his reflective 1872 article, read before the Dublin Statistical Society, ruminating over the optimal extent of government involvement in the economy.  He ruminates on the possibility of the state getting involved in schemes to improve social welfare, such as education systems and old age pension schemes, so long as it does not have a disincentive effect on labor, or increasing taxes so long as it does not affect savings rates.. Politically involved, Mountifort Longfield was a Whig Liberal and was repeatedly consulted by the Liberal PM William E. Gladstone on Irish matters.  In 1867, Longfield became a  member of the Irish Privy Council.      Major Works of Mountifort Longfield     Resources on Mountiford Longfield   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Achille Loria, 1857-1943,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/loria.htm," Italian economist, sociologist and politician ,of socialist leanings. Achille Loria was professor of economics at Siena (1881) and Padua (1891), before moving to the university of Turin in 1903, where he would remain for three decades.  Achille Loria began his studies in jurisprudence, and wrote his original 1877 law thesis on the legal and historical basis of landed property.  Rather than seeing it as a product of human nature or an eternal ""essential"" in any social order, Loria posited property was an outcome of a peculiar configuration of historical and economic circumstances. This would be a theme which would resonate for the remainder of his career.   To probe deeper, Loria began studying economics in 1877, then moved to Berlin to study with German Historicist. Adolphe Wagner, then moved to London, continuing his studies independently before returning to Italy. Achille Loria was appointed professor of economics at Siena (1881) and then Padua (1891), around which time he fell in with Giornale degli Economisti crowd. Although his historical-institutionalist approach separated Loria from fellow giornalisti, notably high theorists Maffeo Pantaleoni and Vilfredo Pareto, they seemed to have gotten along well enough.    In 1903, Achille Loria moved to the University of Turin, where he would remain for the next three decades.  Although claiming membership in many prestigious European academies, Loria saw himself as a public intellectual, with a mission to popularize economic ideas for social reform.   He dabbled in Italian political scene, becoming an important figure behind the Riforma Sociale. Although politically leaning towards the reformist democratic left, rather than outright socialism, Loria nonetheless articulated radical ideas on land reform.  Loria was eventually made Senator of Italy in 1919.  He retired in 1934. Achille Loria's major work was his Le basi economiche della costituzione sociale (Economic foundations of Society) first published in Italian 1886, but greatly expanded in the second edition (in French) in 1893 (which had to be translated back to Italian). It sets out morality, law and political institutions on the basis of underlying economic circumstances.  Loria sees Malthusian population dynamics interacting with the availability of land as the keys to historical changes, and consequently the development of social institutions.  Achille Loria's 1893 GdE article on the economic theory of law is often hailed as a progenitor of ""law and economics"" movement. As is evident, Loria's ideas intersected the theories of Karl Marx, although Loria eschewed historical materialism and instead proposed what he called ""historical economism"" (his term).   He wrote several  revisionist pieces on Marx, which hardly endeared him to the orthodox Marxist school and provoked virulent attacks by Frederick Engels. In the preface (pp) to the third volume of Marx's Capital, Engels baldly accuses Loria of misrepresenting Marx's theories  in his 1883 panegyric after Marx's death and stealing (and vulgarizing) Marx's theory for his own 1886 treatise. Loria was also one of the first to identify and try to solve the Marxian ""transformation problem"" (1883, 1889, 1890). E.R.A. Seligman 1902 treatise would popularize Loria's theories in the English-speaking world.      Major Works of Achille Loria   Resources on Achille Loria   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Adolph Lowe, 1893-1995.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lowe.htm," Adolph Lowe (born Adolf Löwe) was for a long time the eminence grise of the New School for Social Research. Born in Stuttgart, Germany as Adolf Löwe (changed the spelling of his name later to ""Adolph Lowe"").  Lowe studied law, philosophy and economics at Munich and Berlin, receiving his doctorate from Tübingen in 1918.  A veteran of World War I, Lowe helped plan the postwar demobilization of the German army, and served in the Socialization Committee which sought to nationalize the German economy. In 1922, Lowe joined the Ministry of Labor Economics of the Weimar Republic, becoming head of international statistics in the Federal Statistical Bureau in 1924.. In 1926, Adolph Lowe was appointed professor of economics and sociology at the University of Kiel.  Lowe founded the Kiel Institute of World Economics, a center dedicated to business cycle research whose other members included Fritz Burchardt, Gerhard Colm, Jacob Marschak and Hans Neisser.   Lowe's famous 1926 WWA article was a cogent critique of the existing division between business cycle literature and equilibrium economic theory, and called for the development of a endogenous theory of economic fluctuations.  Drawing on a Central European tradition that stemmed from Marx's scheme of extended reproduction, Lowe found a new manner of conceiving motion in business cycle theory.  Lowe's concern with changing multisectoral structure over the cycle, as outlined in his 1926 essay, preceded and inspired a similar notion in the young Friedrich Hayek's business cycle theory. Lowe's own subsequent work, in particular the analysis of the ""traverse"" from one growth equilibrium to another (1952, 1954, 1976), has its roots in this paper. Lowe left Kiel to become professor of economics at the University of Frankfurt in 1931. There, Lowe came into fruitful contact with Horkheimer, Adorno and other members of the ""Frankfurt School"" of sociology - an influence that never left him. As a cosmopolitan, social democrat, ex-member of the German Socialization Committee and an architect of the Weimar Republic, Adolph Lowe's position in Nazi-controlled Germany was quite untenable. Lowe was the first professor in the social sciences fired by the Nazis in 1933.  Lowe promptly left for England in 1933 to take up a position at the University of Manchester.  When World War II began, Lowe found his position as an ""enemy alien"" caused discomfort - in spite of his naturalization and past history and he resolved on leaving England in 1940. His Price of Liberty (1936) outlines some of his impressions of Great Britain. During his stay at Frankfurt and Manchester, Lowe moved away from business cycle research he had pursued at Kiel and towards social philosophy and economic methodology. His famous 1935 Economics and Sociology, was exactly what its subtitle indicates: a ""plea for cooperation in the social sciences"". As he outlined there and in a few follow-up articles (1936, 1942), conventional economic equilibrium theory rested ultimately not only on a rather debatable conception of mechanistic rationality but also conditional on the assumption of the constancy and uniformity of individual behavior. This assumption, in Lowe's view, was not only unrealistic, but also unnecessarily restrictive and removed most of what was interesting (and necessary) for the analysis of economic motion. Lowe's doubts about the assumption of the ""universality"" of specific economic behavior echoed the position of the German Historical School of previous generations. His hopes for fruitful interaction between economics and sociology in this regard also dovetailed with his interest in the role and structure of universities (1937, 1940). Lowe arrived in the United States in 1940, to join the New School for Social Research, and became the director of the ""Institute of World Affairs"" - the New School's attempt to resurrect the old Kiel Institute. His indefatigable efforts in this regard led him to temporarily suspend his work on economic methodology and social structure. His 1951 article attacking the ""mechanistic approach"" to economics signalled his return to this field. His pre-war questions began to take a more definite form around this time - namely, in two issues which dominated the rest of his career, the ""economic traverse"" and ""instrumental analysis"". Underlying both of these concepts was the recognition of changing and heterogeneous behavioral patterns - the crux of Lowe's pre-war musings. If this is granted, then the approach of orthodox economic theory practically irrelevant as the object of study was continuously changing. As noted, the analysis of the ""traverse"", already contained in his Kiel work, but only really formulated in the 1950s (e.g. 1952, 1954, 1955), addressed the issue of movements from a particular growth path to another and the detailing of the implied adjustment paths and the modifications in behavioral and economic structures which both engender and are implied by them. Thus, the dynamics behind the traverse, he envisioned to be related to socio-economic evolution which should not, indeed could not, be considered an exclusively economic phenomenon. He continued developing his ideas on the relationship between evolution and growth, in particular, outlining the role of changing behavior and multiple behavior patterns on the resulting economic process. His position is perhaps best outlined in his masterful and inspiring On Economic Knowledge (1965). Lowe's ""instrumental analysis"" proposed to sidestep the problem of tractability implied by changing structure by considering a type of economics which combined both prescribed behavioral patterns and economic analysis when dealing with economic policy. In Lowe's view, behavior was endogenous - both to economic structure and economic policy. As any economic analysis or prescription is conditional on a particular type of behavior, then Lowe concluded, economic policy must ultimately tackle the twin tasks of ""setting"" the behavioral configurations and using the ""appropriate"" theory implied by that behavior. Lowe's work on the traverse and instrumental analysis is best laid out in his two great works, On Economic Knowledge (1965) and The Path of Economic Growth (1976) and his article ""Toward a Science of Economics"" (1969) - which were received with bewilderment by much of the economics profession. Not quite used to any kind of post-eighteenth century thinking, economists were caught between accusing him of being an ""anti-theorist"", an ""authoritarian"" or simply a troublemaker. Of course, he was none of these (except perhaps the last). Firstly, as noted, he gave a central role to economic theory in his system - indeed, if anything, he perhaps allowed for too many economic theories. Furthermore, Lowe went to great pains to note that his ""instrumentalism"" is far from a prescription for socialist policy. Indeed, Lowe stressed quite the contrary: that freedom is ultimately only possible in a constrained scenario - indeed, it can only be ""defined"" within constraints. Lowe's notions of ""constrained freedom"" and ""spontaneous conformity"" were standard concepts long familiar to sociologists and philosophers - nay, even earlier (cf. Goethe). In fact, in a modern light, Lowe's position is almost self-evident. If one recognizes the mutability of economic behavior, then policy must ultimately take behavioral considerations into account. In recognizing that economic policy can set the parameters within which individual behavior operates, Lowe thus sets out a proposition similar in tone to the later ""Lucas Critique"" of econometric policy-making. Where Lowe goes one step ahead of Lucas, then, is in suggesting that these parameters should themselves be considered as policy instruments - which not too radical a proposition by modern standards when one considers, say, the ""reputation"" debate on monetary policy and inflation and indeed, the Public Choice school. Thus, in modern light, the charges of ""incipient authoritarianism"" that were heaped upon Lowe during the 1960s and 1970s seem obviously untenable. However, to Cold War contemporaries, Lowe's propositions were uncomfortable - even though Lowe suggested examples that ought to be familar to them (e.g. how is laissez-faire sustainable without anti-trust legislation?). Almost alone among economists, the American Institutionalists recognized that Lowe's analysis resonated with their own work - and appropriately granted him the Veblen-Commons Award. In his subsequent lecture (1980), he reiterated his position on instrumental analysis - and chastising economists of all stripes for overemphasizing either theory or empiricism. Like Veblen almost a century before, Lowe reiterated that the need was for a new economics which could incorporate the insights of both and, at the same time, stretch far beyond them. Lowe ""retired""(sic) in 1963, remaining at the New School as a lecturer, until he returned to Germany in 1983. Lowe died at the ripe old age of 102. Until the end of his life, he still clung optimistically to his great and as yet unfulfilled hope: the fruitful interdisciplinary communication between economics and sociology.

"Samuel Jones Loyd, Lord Overstone", 1796-1883.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/overstone.htm," British banker, leader of the Currency School, and principal architect of Peel's Banking Act of 1844. Samuel Jones Loyd (not ""Lloyd""), known as Lord Overstone after 1850, was the son of Lewis Loyd, a Welsh dissenting minister, and Sarah Jones, heiress to a banking family.  Also out of that union would come forth the bank of Jones, Loyd & Co. of Manchester.  The junior Loyd was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1818 and taking up a position in his father's bank.  He entered politics immediately, representing the Parliamentary seat of Hythe for the Liberals from 1819 to 1826. Loyd's banking experience made him one of the leading experts on monetary and banking matters in Parliament.  And even after having lost his seat, Loyd continued to be called on for consultation by the ministers of the day.  After the financial crisis of 1825-26,  Parliament broke the Bank of England's monopoly by lifting the prohibition on establishing joint-stock banking companies (albeit note-issuing was limited to outside of London).  The sudden growth of new banks - and associated speculative excesses and spectacular failures - were a cause of serious concern.  Loyd positioned himself at the head of Currency School in the debates of the 1830s and 1840s.   The the country bank disturbances of 1836 and the revelation of the ""Palmer Rule"" in 1830s - that the Bank of England had been maintaining a gold reserve-liabilities ratio of one third -  provoked Loyd's 1837 pamphlet denouncing the rule as evidently inadequate.  Loyd proposed a stricter ""Currency Rule"",  that is, that the Bank should hold 100% gold reserves on note issues, which would thus make banknotes ""just like currency"", and thus eliminate any room for discretionary monetary policy.  He also demanded a  ""single bank of issue"", eliminating note-issuing country banks and extending the Bank of England's monopoly over all England.  In pamphlets and parliamentary evidence, Samuel Jones Loyd railed on the ills of allowing more than one bank of issue and called for tighter restrictions.  The Currency School gained ground and converts, most notably Sir Robert Peel.   Loyd virtually authored the 1844 Bank Charter Act (""Peel's Act"") imposing the Bank of England's monopoly on issue, tying note-issue strictly to gold reserves and severely restricting the creation of joint-stock banks.   The latter restrictions would be gradually lifted in 1858-62, but the remainder would continue in force until World War I. Loyd succeeded his father as head of the Jones, Loyd & Co. bank in 1844.  Curiously, in 1864, Jones, Loyd & Co. would be merged with the  London & Westminster bank, one of the 'new' joint stock banks (founded 1834) which he had so opposed, and had been managed by his free banking school rival, J.W. Gilbart. Loyd received a peerage in 1850, being made the First Baron Overstone of Overstone and Fotheringhay.  He was also the last. Upon his death, with only a daughter, the Overstone title became extinct.      Major Works of Samuel Loyd, Lord Overstone     Resources on Lord Overstone All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
"Robert E. Lucas, Jr.", 1937-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lucas.htm,"  One of the most influential modern economic theorists, Robert Lucas is the leader of the New Classical school - the ""modern"" version of the Chicago School. His introduction of the concept of ""rational expectations"" in the 1970s helped to decisively bury the Neo-Keynesian orthodoxy and inaugurated a new era of macroeconomics relying on the Neoclassical concept of supply-determined equilibrium, best exemplified in modern ""Real Business Cycle"" theory. He also made seminal contributions to the theory of investment (with ""marginal adjustment costs"", 1967), theory of endogenous growth (with ""human capital"", 1988), theory of asset pricing and the theory of money (with ""cash-in-advance""). He is also renowned for the ""Lucas Critique"" (1976) of the use of econometric models for policy purposes. A professor at Chicago, Lucas won the Nobel prize in 1995.

Cardinal Juan de Lugo, 1583-1660,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lugo.htm," Spanish Jesuit scholar, originating from a noble family of Seville, studied law at the university of Salamanca, although well after its heyday.  Against his father's wishes, Juan de Lugo abandoned his legal studies and joined the Jesuit Order in 1603.  After teaching for a while at Medina del Campo and Valladolid, de Lugo was invited to Rome, where he spent the rest of his career. He was appointed cardinal, on the strength of his theological writings (although de Lugo was famously shy in getting them published, manuscript copies made the rounds in theological circles). In his principal economic work is found in his legal treatise De justitia et jure (1642). de Lugo went further than his Salamanca and Jesuit predecessors in departing from Scholastic thought.  He was perhaps the first to combine scarcity and utility in a single theory of value. Also defined profits as ""wages"" for entrepreneurial services.  His discussion of usury devastated the Scholastic arguments. It is perhaps significant that 1642 was also the year in which Thomas Hobbes published De Cive.  It is perhaps not unjust to regard de Lugo as the closing argument of the Salamanca School, completing the transition from Scholasticism to natural philosophy.

Erik Lundberg, 1907-1987.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lundberg.htm,"  Stockholm economist. Although Lundberg had been a student of Cassel's at Stockholm University, Erik Filip Lundberg nonetheless was more ""Wicksellian"" in spirit. Lundberg's formidable 1937 thesis was the most articulate and comprehensive statement of the Stockholm School's method of ""sequence analysis"".  His analysis of ""gaps"" in goods and labor markets predates the ""disequilibrium"" Walrasian-Keynesian approach of Don Patinkin and Bent Hansen. Lundberg was director of the Swedish business cycle center (Konjukturinstitutet) from 1937.  In 1946, Lundberg was elevated to professor of economics at Stockholm University (a newly-created third chair, alongside Gunnar Myrdal and  Gösta Bagge).

After a period in the private sector, re-joined Eucken at the faculty of the University of Freiburg in 1932.  His 1932 work on was a contribution to the business cycle theory debate. His liberal political views unamenable to the Nazis, Friedrich Lutz traveled to England on a Rockefeller fellowship in 1934-35.  Lutz eventually married L.S.E. economist Vera C. Smith in April 1937, and they traveled on a second Rockefeller fellowship to the United States in 1938, where Lutz took a position as instructor at Princeton in 1939, eventually rising to full professor.  The Lutzes remained in Princeton until 1951,  when they returned to Europe.  After a visiting position at Freiburg for a year, Friedrich A. Lutz became professor of economics at the University of Zurich in 1953, where he remained until his retirement. Friedrich Lutz's main contributions are in the Neoclassical theory of interest and investment.   His influential Theory of Investment (1951), co-written with Vera, tried to merge conventional Neoclassical and time-dependent Austrian theories.

Rosa Luxemburg, 1870-1919.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/luxemburg.htm," The Polish-born ""Red Rosa"" is perhaps best known as one of the leaders in the 1919 Spartacist Revolution in Germany which ended with her murder while in the custody of the German army. She had been the founder of the Polish Social Democratic Party and headed the left wing of the German Social Democratic Party.   Although her early challenge to Engels on the tactics of the left and her role in the 1919 German Revolution are perhaps best known, it is in her role as a Marxian theoretician that she concerns us here.  Luxemburg was no fan of the ""revisionist"" theory of Eduard Bernstein and was, together with Kautsky, the main defender of Marx against Bernstein's critiques - stressing again the issues of imperialism and finance capital which she felt Bernstein had overlooked. Her attack on Bernstein in Social Reform or Revolution (1899) was a very effective - if bitter - destruction of the revisionist arguments. In her famous treatise, The Accumulation of Capital (1913), she entered into the ""crises debate"".  Her particular contribution was to note that in a ""closed"" capitalist system, eternal accumulation of capital is impossible as it cannot absorb all the surplus value it produces.  By accessing non-capitalist socialist formations, this breakdown could be forestalled.   Thus, Luxemburg sets forth her theory of Imperialism as the conflict between capitalist nations for a places to dump their excess consumer goods and thus forestall crises.   As a result, she argued that much of the pre-war instability arose from the ""capitalist-imperialist"" conflict among the great European powers.   Luxemburg was the main leader of the ""Spartacus League"" formed during the World War I to counter the German Social Democrats' support of the war.  She was duly arrested for her opposition and released only in 1918 -- just in time for her to lead the ill-fated German revolution of 1918 with Karl Liebnicht.

Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1800-59 ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/macaulay.htm," English Whig lawyer, politician, essayist, poet and popular historian.  In his early years after leaving Cambridge, Macaulay was active in the Anti-Slavery and Parliamentary Reform movements (although he was no fan of universal suffrage).   Macaulay's early popular writings in the Edinburgh Review ensured him a career as an intellectual pundit.  In one of the most famous episodes, in 1829, Macaulay he tore apart James Mill's argument for democracy on utilitarian grounds.  He also disputed Mill's notion that men always act in their ""self-interest"" -- that is either a truism, Macaulay argued, or an empirical falsehood.   He crossed swords in economics again with his 1830 critique of Michael Sadler's population theory.   Macaulay's 1830 critique of Southey's woolly socialism and imperialism, stands as a classic of laissez-faire Whiggism. Upon entering Parliament as a liberal Whig in 1830, Macaulay was instrumental in getting the 1832 Reform Bill passed.  In the subsequent election, he unseated Sadler.  In 1834, he took a job at the Supreme Council of India and became heavily involved in the redrafting the Indian penal code and the promotion of education (in Indian affairs, he was much influenced by the now-reconciled Mill).  In 1839, Macauley returned to Parliament as an MP for Edinburgh, served for brief periods in cabinet posts and then retired in 1856.  He was granted a peerage in 1857.  During his time, Macaulay wrote his most famous work -- the five-volume (but still lightweight) History of England.  This is the work that gave rise to the term ""Whig history"", the presentation of historical events as a ""progress"" from the imperfect past towards the perfect present. Macaulay's history, while vividly written, is barely anything more than a self-congratulatory exercise.      Major Works of Thomas Macaulay     Resources on T.B.

Niccolò Machiavelli, 1469-1527,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/machiavelli.htm," Florentine diplomat and political philosopher.  Niccolò Machiavelli served as a state officer of the Republic of Florence in the chaotic interlude between the fall of Savonarola and the restoration of the Medici.  A close advisor to the gonfalonier Pier Soderini, he was exiled by the Medici in 1513.  It was during this banishment that Machiavelli authored his most famous tract, The Prince, intended as a brief handbook of governance for a Renaissance Signore.  Unlike his predecessors, who tended to refer to princely education and the ideals of good governance, Machiavelli acknowledged the real-world ambitions of statesmen - maintaining personal power for power's sake - and directed his instructions to that end. In the Discourses, Machiavelli answers a larger question: when is it appropriate to have republican rather than seigneural government? This normative question is answered by roaming through an examination of the successes and failures of the Roman Republic and the lessons to be drawn from it.  Although the republican sentiments of the Discourses are often contrasted with the tyranny of the Prince, the treatises are not really at odds with each other and both exhibit the Machiavelli's positivistic realist stamp.  Although Machiavelli had privately circulated both the Prince and the Discourses during his period of exile, they were not published until after his death.  They had some effect, if not the as fully as desired, and Machiavelli was allowed to return to the political life of Florence in his last few years. It is unfortunate that unlike some of other Italian writers of the time, such as Carafa, Botero and Davanzati, Machiavelli did not pay much attention to economic matters, and his brief discussions of state finances never go beyond the rudimentary.  His 1502 speech on money, written for Soderini, attempts merely to articulate the necessity of public expenditure for the maintenance of the state. In that respect, Machiavelli has little to add of any value to the history of economic thought, except in his general influence upon the development of ""realist"" approaches to political philosophy, which others would take further and marry to economic policy.

Henry Dunning MacLeod, 1821-1902.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/macleod.htm,"  Scottish lawyer, banker and maverick economist, critic of the Classical school and anticipator to the Marginalist Revolution Born to a family of wealth Scottish landowners, Henry Dunning Macleod was raised in Edinburgh and studied at Trinity College, Cambridge.  He subsequently called to the bar in 1849.  Among Macleod's first works (1851) was a study of Scottish Poor Laws.  In 1853, Macleod was appointed director of the Royal British Bank.   It was in the course of writing reports for the bank, that Macleod first delved into economic literature, reading Adam Smith, David Ricardo and John Stuart Mill.  As he recounts later in his life: ""I can hardly express the disappointment I felt at reading them...for the purpose of describing the actual principles and mechanisms of commerce they were absolutely worthless. They were merely a chaos of confusion and contradictions...In fact, they were in no sense a science, but the butchery of a science. I saw that the greatest opportunity that had come to any man since Galileo had come to me, and I then determined to devote myself to the construction of a real science of Economics on the model of the already established physical sciences. (Macleod, 1896, pp. 142–3) In a prelude to this mission, Macleod composed his Theory and Practice of Banking (1855-56), a work of largely historical character, hailed by many as his most sober work.  It is here that Macleod famously ""discovers"" the use of the discount rate as a policy tool by the Bank of England. Macleod's scientific reconstruction really begins in his Elements (1858).  Against the Classicals, Macleod embraced the 'catallactic' approach of Whately, emphasizing economics as the 'science of exchanges', with value determined solely by supply and demand.  He rejects the Classical cost-of-production theory of long-run price as scientifically invalid, the distinction between short and long periods as repugnant to logic, and, to top it off, an insidious encourager of labor unrest.  Rebuilding the theory of value on supply-and-demand theory, Macleod appealed to the physical sciences and mathematics to provide the constructive image and tools of the science - calling economics the ""Queen of the social sciences"", to jurisprudence to ground property rights on the things to be exchanged and the institutional details of credit and money to provide the context.  It is, incidentally, in this work where Macleod first coins the term ""Gresham's Law"" (p.477).  Macleod's self-congratulations and his vehement attacks on the Classicals - notably John Stuart Mill - ensured his work would be received coldly.  It was not helped that it was marred by a bizarre language, repetitiousness, littered with juristic terms and obscure references.  But Macleod would be later acknowledged by Jevons as a predecessor to the Marginalist Revolution. An additional factor may very well be Macleod's sudden embroilment in a very public scandal after the Royal British Bank collapsed in 1857.   The subsequent financial scandal would mar his repeated attempts to acquire a university chairs - he competed for the professorship in political economy at Cambridge in 1863 (it went to Fawcett) and at UCL in 1866 (it went to Cairnes). Nonetheless, Macleod's works on banking were well-received. His ""credit theory"" of money and wealth in his Theory of Credit (1889) and elsewhere.  This is perhaps his most original achievement, although it is anticipated to a good degree by the ""anti-metallist"" theories of Berkeley, Law, Boisguilbert and Steuart.

Silas M. MacVane, 1824-1914,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/macvane.htm," Canadian-born American classical-historicist at Harvard. The son of Highland Scottish immigrants, Silas Marcus MacVane was born and raised in Bothwell, on Prince Edward Island in Canada. He went on to study at Acadia College in Nova Scotia, obtaining his BA in 1865.  After a period in the Halifax bureaucracy, MacVane decamped for a academic tour in Germany, attending lectures in Berlin, imbibing the waters of the nascent German Historical School.  MacVane was one of the earliest of the German-trained ""new generation economists that would flood back to America. Silas MacVane emigrated to the United States, taking up an appointment as a high school teacher in Roxbury, Massachusetts, while obtaining another BA degree from Harvard in 1873.  In 1875, Harvard president Charles W. Elliott appointed Silas M. MacVane as instructor in economics at Harvard, thus becoming the second teacher of economics at Harvard (after professor Charles Dunbar).  MacVane moved sideways in 1878 to become instructor in history at Harvard, leaving economics in the hands of new hire J. Laurence Laughlin.  MacVane consequently climbed the academic ladder in the history department at Harvard - becoming assistant professor in 1883, and full professor of history in 1886. MacVane nonetheless continued active in economics until 1911. A thorough Ricardian in his theory, Silas MacVane launched attacks on the budding Neoclassical in the Quarterly Journal of Economics.  He got into polemics over the theory of distribution with Francis A. Walker and Alfred Marshall in 1887-88 (earning a chiding note from Marshall).  MacVane subsequently turned his guns on the Austrians, garnering responses from Böhm-Bawerk and Wieser. MacVane resigned from Harvard in 1911, and moved to Rome, Italy, partly to help advance the artistic careers of his daughters.  His three daughters went on to fame of their own - Edith as a writer, Emily as an artist and Dorothy as an opera singer.  MacVane died in Rome in 1914.       Major Works of Silas M.

"Jehan Cherruyt, Sieur de Malestroict", ? - ?  (fl.1560s),https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/malestroit.htm,"16th Century monetary writer. Little is known of the Sieur de Malestroit (archaically spelled Malestroict), save that he was a French master of royal accounts and the author of a series of Paradoxes (written 1566) that were disputed by Jean Bodin  (the personal name ""Jehan Cherruyt"" is not given on the tract, but is assigned by later historians, drawing on other French records). The Paradoxes were written, in typically Scholastic form, to invite open debate on the question of the great price inflation which had arisen in the mid-16th Century in many European countries.   The inflation debate was already going on in the Salamanca School in Spain, but Malestroit opened here the debate in France.  He posited two paradoxes: (1) there is no inflation and has been no inflation for the past 300 years; (2) ""that a significant loss can be made on an ecu (or other gold or silver coin) even though it is paid out at the same price at which it was received""

Malestroit posited that the value of goods was directly related to gold and silver content of coinage.  He goes on to explained that the great inflation could be ascribed purely to the debasement of the currency - not debasement of actual coins by the king (Malestroit's boss), but by the rising moneys of account used by private contracts.  That when this deterioration of the unit of account were adjusted for metal content, there was, in fact, no inflation at all.   To use Malestroit's example, a century earlier, the price of a yard of velvet cloth used to cost 4 livres, and now it cost  10 livres. It seems evident inflation has happened. But the ""livre"" is a unit of accounting money, used in ledgers, not actual metal money.  If you consider instead an ecu (a metal coin), the story is different.  An ecu coin is currently worth 2.5 livres (or 50 sols) in accounting money, but a century ago that same ecu coin was worth 1 livre (or 20 sols) in accounting money.  So the current value of velvet (10 livres) is equivalent four ecus coins - which is exactly the same as it cost (in ecu coins) a century earlier.  Ergo, the real price of velvet, in terms of precious metal money, has not risen, so there is no inflation.  The inflation is a fiction caused by the depreciation of the livre, the unit of accounting money. (""Et ainsi l'encherissement que l'on cuide de estre maintenant sur toutes choses, ce n'est qu'une opinion vaine, ou image de compte sans effet ny substance quelconque."" pp pp.) The second paradox is not much of a paradox - it merely refers to holders of debt instruments (like bonds/rentes), where the security specifies repayment in livres (accounting money)  The depreciation of the accounting money relative to gold coin, means that you receive now less in gold than you originally lent out. Malestroict's first argument was disputed by Jean Bodin.  Bodin not only casts doubt on Malestroit's empirical facts (did velvet even exist in France back then?), constructs his own price series (yes, Jehan, there has been inflation, even in gold coins), but more famously,  goes on to formulate the quantity theory of money as a general explanation of inflation. Bodin's reply was attached to a 1568 reprint of the Paradoxes. Both Malestroit and Bodin were replied to by Gerard de Malynes.

Edmond Malinvaud, 1923-2015,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/malinvaud.htm," French general equilibrium and general disequilibrium theorist and econometrician. Originating from Limoges, France, Edmond Malinvaud studied at  École polytechnique in Paris. After a brief interruption during the war, Malinvaud joined the fledgling French national statistics and economics institute (INSEE) in 1946, completing his education in economics at its attached school (now the  École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Economique, ENSAE)..  Malinvaud was, together with Debreu, a student of France's greatest Walrasian economist, Maurice Allais.  On Allais's recommendation, Malinvaud went with a Rockefeller fellowship to join the the  Cowles Commission in the United States in 1950-51.  Malinvaud returned to the INSEE thereafter, but the Cowles experience propelled Malinvaud work in many directions both in economics and econometrics.  Malinvaud's famous article, ""Capital Accumulation and the Efficient Allocation of Resources"" (1953), incorporated an intertemporal theory of capital into a very natural place in Walrasian general equilibrium theory and helped resolve the old capital theory conflict between Knight and Hayek (and, in part, kept G.E. immune from the later Cambridge Capital Controversy), as well as introducing the concept of dynamic efficiency. He also worked on uncertainty theory, notably the theory of ""first order certainty equivalence"" (1969) and the relationship between individual risks and social risks (1972, 1973).   His 1971 microeconomics textbook and his Cowles-inspired econometrics textbook, Statistical Methods in Econometrics (1964) have since become classics. Malinvaud's main contribution to macroeconomics is represented in his slim 1977 book, Theory of Unemployment Reconsidered which provided a clear and unified reconstruction of the dynamic ""disequilibrium"" macro theory of Clower, Leijonhufvud and the European ""Non-Walrasian"" theory - that is, general equilibrium theory with disequilibruim features.  Malinvaud's influence on the subsequent generation of French economists has been profound. With a few interruptions, Malinvaud has worked at the Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques (INSEE) in Paris, France since 1946, and been its director since 1974.  He was also chair of economic analysis at Collège de France from 1984 to 1993.      Major works of Edmond Malinvaud   HET   Resources on E. Malinvaud   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Thomas Robert Malthus, 1766-1834.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/malthus.htm," Robert Malthus (he went by his middle name, [n]) was born in ""the Rookery"", a country estate in Dorking, Surrey (south of London).  He was the second son of Daniel Malthus, a country gentleman, an Enlightenment enthusiast of liberal views, who left a remarkable imprint on his son..  Daniel was an avid disciple of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and David Hume (both of whom he knew personally), accordingly, Robert Malthus was initially educated according to Rousseauvian precepts by his father and a series of tutors (no fan of formal education, Daniel Malthus himself had studied at Oxford, but left without a degree ""because of a contempt for the distinction""). The young  Malthus subsequently placed in the Warrington Academy, a Dissenter school run by the unitarian Gilbert Wakefield, before finally taking the conventional route and enrolling in Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1784. Malthus achieved the rank of 9th Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos in 1788, and was ordained that same year as a minister of the Church of England in 1788.  He earned his M.A. in 1791. Around 1793, Malthus became a curate of Okewood chapel, a few miles from his father's house in the sleepy town of Albury (in west Surrey).  Malthus was elected Fellow of Jesus College in June 1793 (not 1797 as sometimes stated), and consequently divided his time between Cambridge and Albury.  In his interminable intellectual debates with his father, Malthus wrote his first tract, The Crisis, a political critique of the Pitt administration, but at his father's advice, never published it.  In 1797, William Godwin's Enquirer came out, which opened another round of debates with his father over Godwin's ""perfectibility of man"" thesis.  A similar thesis had also been advanced by the Marquis de Condorcet's Esquisse in 1795, which was also discussed.  Malthus's decided to set his ideas down on paper.  He eventually published it as an anonymous pamphlet, with the title Essay on the Principle of Population (1798).  In this famous work, Malthus posited his hypothesis that the natural (unchecked) rate of population growth always exceeds the growth of means of subsistence.  This implied that actual (checked) population growth is kept in line with food supply growth by ""positive checks"" (starvation, disease and the like, elevating the death rate) and ""preventive checks"" (i.e. postponement of marriage, that keeps down the birthrate).  Malthus's hypothesis implied that actual population always has a tendency to push above the food supply.  Because of this tendency, any attempt to ameliorate the condition of the lower classes by increasing their incomes or improving agricultural productivity would be fruitless, as the extra means of subsistence would be completely absorbed by an induced boost in population.  As long as this tendency remains, Malthus argued, the improvement and ""perfectibility"" of society will always be out of reach.  The future of mankind, Malthus pessimistically concluded, would always be marred by ""misery and vice"".  Malthus's essay elicited a courteous answer from Godwin, and the two engaged in a brief correspondence, prompting Malthus to start contemplating a second edition with some new ideas and, no less importantly, empirical evidence to back his thesis.  In 1799,  Malthus went on a tour in Germany, Scandinavia and Russia, returning home around the time of his father's death in 1800.  He published his tract on the High Price of Provisions, announcing a new edition of the Essay was on the way.  In 1802, with hostilities suspended by the Peace of Amiens, Malthus did a quick tour of France and Switzerland.  Malthus's second edition of the Essay finally appeared in June 1803, much revised and expanded. Malthus concentrated on bringing the empirical evidence gathered from his travels to bear.  He also introduced the possibility of ""moral restraint"" (voluntary abstinence which leads to neither misery nor vice) bringing the unchecked population growth rate down to a point where the tendency is gone.  In practical policy terms, this meant inculcating the lower classes with middle-class virtues, which he believed was to be primarily done by urging and preaching to the poor to change their improvident habits.  He also conjectured the enbourgeoisement of the proletariat could be furthered along with the introduction of universal suffrage, state-run education for the poor and, more controversially, the elimination of the Poor Laws and the establishment of an unfettered nation-wide labor market, so that the poor would fear falling and aspire to rise.  Malthus also tentatively suggested that once the poor had ""a taste for the comforts and conveniences of life"", then they would demand a higher standard of living for themselves before starting a family.  Thus, although seemingly contradictory, Malthus is already suggesting the kernel of the possibility of  a ""demographic transition"", i.e. that sufficiently high incomes may be enough by themselves to reduce fertility. The Essay transformed Malthus into an intellectual celebrity.  He was reviled by many as a  prophet of doom, an enemy of the working class, a hard-hearted monster, the man who ""defended smallpox, slavery and child-murder and denounced soup-kitchens, early marriage and parish allowances"" (n),  etc.  The ridicule and invective rained down on Malthus by the pamphleteering classes was relentless, including some of the most prominent commentators of the day, such as William Hazlitt, William Cobbett, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey (Malthus's critics derisively deployed the appellation ""Parson Malthus"", to stress Malthus's lowly rank at the bottom of the church hierarchy and remind that he never received preferment).  But a sufficient number of people accepted it and popularized it, and by the late 1810s, it is fair to say that Malthus's hypothesis was almost universally accepted and pressure for Poor Law reform placed at the political forefront .  Even his severest critics grudgingly acknowledged his Essay for what it was: the first serious economic study of the welfare of the lower classes..  Of all his critics on population, Malthus deigned only to reply in print (anonymously) to William Godwin in the 1821 Edinburgh Review. In 1804, Malthus got married and thereby forfeited his fellowship at Cambridge.  In 1805, Malthus was appointed Professor of Modern History and Political Economy at the East India College in Haileybury, thereby becoming the England's first academic economist.  Malthus got interested in monetary topics in 1800, when he published a pamphlet (much praised by Keynes), expounding an endogenous theory of money.  Contrary to the Quantity Theory, Malthus argued that rising prices are followed by increases in the quantity supplied of money.  Around 1810, Malthus came across a series of tracts by a stockbroker, David Ricardo, on the bullionist controversy.  He immediately wrote to Ricardo and the two men initiated a correspondence (and a friendship) that would last for over a decade.  The Malthus-Ricardo relationship was warm in all respects but one -- economics.  They found themselves on opposites sides of the fence on practically every economic question.  Except population.  Ricardo accepted the Malthusian population doctrine, and incorporated the Malthusian wage-fertility dynamics to pin down the ""natural wage"" in his 1817 treatise.  Despite attempts to displace it later with the Wages Fund theory, the ""iron law of wages"" would remain a part of the canonical long-run model of the Classical school.   In 1814, Malthus launched himself into the Corn Laws debate then raging in parliament.  After a first pamphlet, Observations, outlining the pros and cons of the proposed protectionist laws, Malthus tentatively supported the free traders, arguing that as cultivation as British corn was increasingly expensive to raise, it was best if Britain relied at least in part on cheaper foreign sources for its food supply.  He changed his mind the next year, in his 1815 Grounds of an Opinion pamphlet, siding now with the protectionists.  Foreign laws, he noted, often prohibit or raise taxes on the export of corn in lean times, which meant that the British food supply was captive to foreign politics.  By encouraging domestic production, Malthus argued, the Corn Laws would guarantee British self-sufficiency in food.   In his 1815 Inquiry, Malthus came up with the differential theory of rent.   Although it was simultaneously discovered by Torrens, West and Ricardo, Malthus's pamphlet was the first of the four to be published. Refuting older contentions that rent was a cost of production, Malthus argued that it was merely a deduction from the surplus.  Rent, Malthus argued, is enabled by three facts: (1) that agricultural production yields a surplus; (2) that the wage-fertility dynamics guarantee that the price of corn would remains steadily above its cost of production; (3) that fertile land is scarce.  Ricardo own 1815 essay was actually a response to Malthus.  Ricardo dismissed Malthus's arguments, arguing that Malthus's ""third"" cause -- that land differs in quality and is limited in quantity -- is sufficient to explain the phenomenon of rent.  He incorporated Malthus's theory of rent with his own theory of profits to provide the ""Classical"" statement of the theory of distribution.  He also dismissed Malthus's feeble attempts to defend parasitical landlords and the Corn Laws. Malthus's own criticism of Ricardo's 1815 essay led them into a debate on the question of ""value"".  Malthus supported Smith's old ""labor-commanded"" theory of value, whereas Ricardo favored the ""labor-embodied"" version.  The outcome of the discussion was Ricardo's Principles in 1817, which set down the doctrine of the Classical School on value, distribution and production, incorporating at least two of Malthus's own contributions: the ""natural wage"" version of Malthus's population theory and an expanded version of Malthus's theory of rent.   Malthus was never comfortable as a member of the Classical school.  Nowhere is this more evident than in Malthus's own treatise, Principles of Economics (1820), where he sets out where his views differ from the Classical Ricardians at several points.  For instance, Malthus introduced the idea of a demand schedule in the modern sense, i.e. as the conceptual relationship between prices and the quantity sought by buyers rather than the empirical relationship between prices and quantities sold.  He also paid much attention to the short-run stability of prices.  Thirdly, and most famously, Malthus denied the validity of Say's Law and argued that there could be a ""general glut"" of goods. Malthus believed that economic crises were characterized by a general excess supply caused by insufficient consumption.  His defense of the Corn Laws rested partly on the need for landlord consumption to ""make up"" for shortfalls in demand and thus avert crisis.  See our more extensive discussion of the General Glut Controversy. Malthus was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1819, and was one of the founding members of the Political Economy Club in 1821, although he found the atmosphere there was not always congenial to his views, with James Mill poking at theories of value and underconsumption and McCulloch poking at his population theory. Malthus wrote a pamphlet on the Measure of Value, in 1823, reiterating his labor-commanded theory, contributed two articles to the Royal Society of Literature and gave evidence before a parliamentary committee on emigration in 1827. His population theory suffered a severe theoretical assault from Nassau William Senior in 1829, who insisted that aspirations of the working classes for higher standards of living for themselves could (and did) lead to voluntary curbing of birth rates.  This prompted a brief correspondence where Malthus, in which Malthus almost conceded. As Senior himself pointed out, the demographic transition was a possibility that Malthus himself had originally proposed, even if he de-emphasized its practical importance and ignored its policy implications.  Senior's views gained ground in the Political Economy Club, and soon moved to a proxy fight in the wider press in the early 1830s, between George Poulett Scrope (emboldened by Senior) and Malthusian loyalist Thomas Chalmers, with Michael Sadler in the middle, muddying the waters by slightly modifying the Malthusian hypothesis. Under theoretical attack from Senior et al, the prospects for the continued acceptance of the Malthus's hypothesis seemed to rest on the hope that empirical evidence might bear it out. Gambling in that direction, Malthus took an interest in the fledgling field of statistics and empirical economics, which empiricsts William Whewell and Richard Jones were trying to promote at Cambridge.  At a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) in Cambridge in 1832,  Malthus met the Belgian statistician Adolphe Quetelet, and urged him to take on the empirics and resolve the population debate.  At that same conference,  Whewell and Jones enlisted Malthus's support to persuade the BAAS to create ""Section F"" on statistics and political economy.   The same trio also helped found the Statistical Society of London (SSL) the next year (March, 1834).  Malthus saw his main policy goal - the reform of the Poor Laws - finally accomplished by parliament in early 1834.  But he did not live long enough  to witness the empirical verdict on his theory.  Malthus died on December 23, 1834, while still in the process of editing a second edition of the Principles (which came out posthumously in 1836).  Quetelet, who had been intrigued enough to give Malthus's hypothesis a shot, published his inconclusive results in 1836 (although one of his students, Pierre-François Verhulst, looked into it more closely and came up with his famous ""logistical curve"").  But it was J.R. McCulloch's monumental 1837 compilation of data from the British census that put the empirical nail in the coffin of the Malthusian hypothesis.  McCulloch showed that birth rates had remained virtually unchanged, even declined a little in the late 1790s, that the explosion in population growth Malthus had attributed to rising birth rates was in fact due to steeply declining death rates.  The debate was not altogether over - the Malthusian hypothesis was resumed again a decade later, and would continue to be discussed again at least until the turn of the century, and intermittently in the 20th Century.  The Malthus hypothesis was finally integrated with the Senior hypothesis as two phases of a single model of ""demographic transition"". Malthus's chair in Political Economy and Modern History at East India College in Haileybury was inherited by Richard Jones, who resigned from King's College London in 1835 to take up the new post.

Gerard de Malynes, c.1586-1641. ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/malynes.htm,"Early British Mercantilist, whose misfortunes as a merchant possibly encouraged him to denounce the trading policies of charter companies (notably, the East India Company), advocating a return to the staple system (where teams of merchants were involved in the trade).  Born to a Flemish family in Antwerp ('De Mechelen', although possibly of Lancashire origin), Gerard de Malynes emigrated to London in the 1580s.  Probably on the strength of his father's connections, Gerard de Malynes was appointed assay master of the Royal Mint and served on several government commissions advising advising on economic problems during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I.  In 1592,  Malynes became involved in a shabby deal involving a bid for the  cargo of a captured Spanish ship, on behalf of a group of Amsterdam merchants.  When the numbers didn't add up, the Dutch traders accused Malynes of embezzlement and a lengthy and painful series of lawsuits ensued, crawling through the English courts, that ended only in 1610 with Malynes in debtor's prison for three years.  This experience may have embittered  him towards the merchants and usurers against whom he would soon turn his pen. Shortly after serving on a royal commission on exchanges in 1600,  Gerard de Malynes exploded into print in 1601, with two vituperative treatises lamenting the state of the English economy (and society), placing the blame firmly on the machinations of merchants, usurers and currency dealers. The disease, the canker, of England, was the ""Marchandising Exchange"", i.e. the international money market.  Malynes believed that English coin was undervalued in foreign currency markets, with the result England regularly received less cash for its exports and paid more for imports, and that this had led to an outflow of cash from the kingdom. (He did not imagine undervaluation might affect the volume of exports and imports - he assumed these were demanded and supplied inelastically).   The drain of coin, Malynes alleged, had led to a fall in the domestic price level that had been disruptive of trade and employment.  Malynes attacked the very notion of allowing currency to be valued on the market, noting that it was issued by the King, to whose value he has pledged his good name with his stamp, and that private persons speculating and altering the value of the coin constitute an attack on royal authority, and thus treasonable as any other offense.  But Malynes recognizes that the king's own debasements and unrealistic mint ratios have played a role in feeding the speculative money markets abroad.  As a result, he recommends setting the face value of the coin exactly equal to its metallic content - par pro pari - and the strict regulation of foreign exchange transactions.  To this end, Malynes advocates the resurrection of the ancient office of 'Royal Exchanger' centralizing foreign exchange transactions in royal hands.  This office had been abolished a half-century earlier (on the advice of Sir Thomas Gresham), but would indeed by resurrected by Charles I in 1627. In this manner, Malynes argued, the value of money would become immune from the vagaries of the market and the money that currently sloshed around in wasteful and disruptive speculation on the money market would find its way back to its original role, a public convenience, provided by the King's grace, to circulate national commodities. But he did not end there.  Drawing much from Aristotle, the Scholastics and a myriad of disparate sources, Malynes launches an all-out attack on other 'immoral' and 'amoral' pillars of nascent capitalism - the merchants with their speculative greed, the usurers with their crushing interest, disruptors of the natural social order and domestic harmony, corrupters of Christian virtue and the moral fabric of the country. ""Plentie or scarcietie of Commodities doth also alter the price of the things wanting or abounding to the use thereof, which is grounded upon estimation by consent after the pleasure and sensualtie of man"" (Malynes) ""plentie of money maketh generally things dear, and scarcitie of money maketh likewise generally things good cheape....According to the plentie or scarcitie of the monie, then, generally things become dearer or good cheape, whereunto the great store or abundance of monie and bullion, which of late years is come from the west Indies into Christendom hath made euery thing dearer according to the increase of monie"" (Malynes)
  Like the ""bullionist"" Thomas Milles, Malynes was a promoter of detailed restrictions on trade and supervision of the export of bullion. Malynes, outlined, following Bodin, how the influx of American gold had risen prices abroad and thus deteriorated the terms of trade for England. Argued that as exchange rates are determined by the machinations of wily financiers allied with the charter companies, damaging bullion exports will always ensue. Thus, the only way to avoid this would be to fix exchange rates to parity and control the export of bullion. Malynes's later tracts (1622, 1623) were direct responses against two works of Edward Misselden, who had argued that the individual export-import transactions did not matter, but only the nation's total balance of trade.

Bernard de Mandeville, 1670-1733 ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/mandeville.htm," Bernard de Mandeville (the 'de' is often omitted) was a Dutch physician from Dort who moved to Britain when he was 29.  Mandeville nonetheless quickly honed his skills in the English language by hack translations of La Fontaine and Scarron (into which he inserted two of his own compositions, the ""Nightingale and the Owl"" and ""the Carp""). He also acquired a taste for Augustan satire and, in his adopted language, outdid the locals with his famous poem Grumbling Hive (1705).  The poem was later incorporated in and elaborated upon in his legendary Fable of the Bees (1714), which included remarks on the poem and an expansive essay on the origin of moral virtue In his Fable of the Bees, subtitled ""private vices, publick benefits"", Mandeville recounts how evil vices such as luxury, greed, envy, etc., all lead to public benefits by encouraging enterprise. For instance: Although apparently often treated as a defense of laissez- faire - ""Thus every Part was full of Vice/Yet the whole Mass a Paradice"" - the Fable can also be seen as a presentation of early underconsumption theory. Anticipating Keynes's paradox of thrift, Mandeville argued that the ""moral"" activity of saving was actually the cause of recessions whereas luxurious consumption (a ""vice"") was a stimulus. Indeed, Mandeville argued for government intervention, including the Mercantilist policy of protection to promote internal consumption (see Remarks L, Q and Y). Thus ""private Vices by the dextrous Management of a skilled Politician may be turned into publick benefits"" (Mandeville, 1714). In this own theory of 'moral sense', Mandeville agrees primarily from Hobbes that man is a self-seeking, selfish creature, and wholly bereft of natural moral virtues.  Contrary to Shaftesbury, moral sense is not innate but deliberately imposed by political society to curb savage man and suppress his naturally selfish instincts and tendencies.  As man ""naturally loves praise"", this is done by deftly cultivating artificial concepts such as honour and shame, and indoctrinating man in these concepts via flattery and human pride, In the second edition of 1723, Mandeville enlarged the Fable by incorporating two essays, ""On Charity and Charity-Schools"" (directed at reforming societies) and ""Search into the Nature of Society"" (directed primarily at Shaftesbury).  A public storm ensued as one moralist after another lined up to attack him.  The book was presented as a public nuisance before a Grand Jury in Middlesex. Mandeville replied with a ""Vindication of the Book"" published originally in newspapers, then added it to the 1724 edition of the Fable.   In 1729, Mandeville wrote a whole new volume, Fable of the Bees, Part II to explain his thesis more fully.  Although Mandeville had alluded to the idea of division of labor previously (e.g. 1723:  p.411), it is here that Mandeville waxes upon it more famously, discussing how division of labor improves labor productivity (1729: p.243) Francis Hutcheson attacked Mandeville in a series of letters in 1726 and published an entire book against it.  The empiricist philosopher, Bishop George Berkeley, directed parts of his Alciphron (1730) and his Discourses Addressed to Magistrates (1736) against Mandeville. Mandeville responded to only a few of his legions of critics, e.g. his Letter to Dion (1732) contra Berkeley and his Vindication (1734). Under a pseudonym, Mandeville is alleged to have been the author of the notorious pamphlet on Modest Defense of Public Stews (1724) urging the establishment of licensed brothels in English cities, written as a satire of public reforming societies (cf. Remarks H &N of the Fable). Nonetheless, in spite of all the abuse heaved upon him -- even when ""Mandeville could prate no more"" (A.Pope, Dunciad, II:414) -- he remained an optimist about contemporary society and the advent of commercial capitalism. In the midst of all the turbulence, his controversial works were read with much interest in his day.  In a way, Mandeville's provocative thesis helped launch the Scottish Enlightenment, by forcing Francis Hutcheson, David Hume and Adam Smith, among others, to come up with a theory of 'moral sense' that advanced upon the platitudes of Shaftesbury.  Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations contains echoes (some say direct borrowings) of Mandevillian insights - the 'private vice, public benefits' thesis (crudely) foreshadows the Smith's 'invisible hand' thesis, Mandeville's discussion of division of labor in society and manufacturing precedes Smith.  Mandeville emphasizes how the wealth of nations depends not on money, but real resources (e.g. Note Q), but he retains  sufficient Mercantilist instincts to argue (tentatively) that a positive trade balance might be a good thing (Note Y).

Jane Haldimand Marcet, 1769-1858.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/marcet.htm," If political economy was the ""rage"" in social circles in the early 19th Century, it was in good part due to the wildly popular 1816 work of Jane Haldimond Marcet.   Educated by tutors in her father's home, Jane Haldimand Marcet's primary interest was botany and chemistry, an interest encouraged by her husband (a doctor and chemistry professor in Geneva, Switzerland).   In 1806, Marcet published her first book, a popular exposition of the principles of chemistry which influenced the great chemist Michael Faraday.  The success of her first book led her to try the same approach to political economy in 1816 with her Conversations on Political Economy.  Marcet presented Classical economic theory  in terms of conversation between a pupil, Caroline, and her tutor, Mrs. B.  Drawing heavily on Adam Smith, Jean-Baptiste Say, Robert Malthus and David Ricardo (whom she knew personally), Marcet's Conversations were a non-critical exposition of the principles of Classical political economy, intended largely for the education of the young and upper class lay people.  Its popularity inspired other writers, notably Harriet Martineau, to try their hand at popular expositions of economics.   Marcet's 1833 John Hopkins book was tailored to be read by the working classes.  She goes through the same topics as before, this time using stories involving John Hopkins, a poor laborer.  An extraordinarily patronizing book, she takes Hopkins' complaints about the hardships of his positions and attempts to justify them in terms of Classical economics.  In retrospect, it is a shameless defense of the status quo of the British class system.  She repeats the exercise in her 1851 Rich and Poor, this time using the medium of Mr. B, a school master in a country village and his six boy  students.  It is notable that here, Marcet switches from the ""iron law of wages"" to the wages fund doctrine.

Juan de Mariana, 1536-1624.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/mariana.htm," 16th C. Spanish Jesuit scholar from Toledo.  Although celebrated for his rather impressive history of Spain (1592),  Juan de Mariana is perhaps far more famous for his controversial 1598 treatise on royal government (De rege et regis institutione).   It is set out as a treatise on good government in the natural philosophy tradition.  But in the course of treatise (Bk 1, C.6), Mariana came up with and defended the proposition that murdering a king is justified, if the king was a 'tyrant'.  But what is tyranny?  Besides the usual definitions, Mariana extends the definition of ""tyranny"", which he takes a step further in his 1599 treatise on weights and measures and his 1609 essay on copper coinage.  He posits a contractual theory of the king's source of power residing in the people, that their royal prerogative is not unlimited, and, most strenuously, that he is not the ultimate owner of all property, but rather that property is private, and belongs to the citizens, and that they have assigned him some property (e.g. taxes) by consent is not license to impose new taxes by royal prerogative.  Interference by the sovereign in private economic matters without consent of the subjects constitutes a form of tyranny.  Oppressive taxation, of course, is an example of tyranny. But, Mariana notes in an addendum to De rege, and expanded upon in his 1609 De monetae essay on coinage, to include debasement of the currency as another form of it.  An extreme metallist, Mariana considers it ""unjust"" for the tale value of a coin not to reflect its intrinsic metal content (allowance being made for modest seignorage to cover the expenses of coinage).   So Mariana's initial objection is a moral objection.  It is unjust,   it steals from the subjects, it is nothing short of a heavy tax imposed without consent, and thus tyranny.   He denies the right of kings to debase coinage.   But he also posits a practical objection.  In his 1609 essay, Mariana considers all the usual arguments in favor of debasement, and deploys his immense historical knowledge to judge whether those promised positive results have actually come to pass in episodes of Spanish history or the history of other nations.  He notes that kings have debased really for only one reason: to wipe out their public debts.  But he does so unjustly, he robs his people, and ultimately hurts the crown in the long run.  All the other promised results don't usually materialize, debasement has always been followed by inflation, which disrupts commerce, raises the cost of living, encourages counterfeiters and is detrimental to the realm.  So Mariana's opposition to debasement is twofold: it is unjust if undertaken without consent; and detrimental if undertaken with consent. Juan de Mariana's contributions on money and economic role of the State were overshadowed by his reflections on tyrannicide.  His De rege could not have been published at a less opportune moment.  It was just around this time that the Jesuit Order, long resented and popularly suspected, was implicated in a few high-profile murder attempts, e.g. on the life of Henry IV of France in 1595 (by the young Jesuit friar Jean Chastel, which led to the brief expulsion of the Jesuits from France until 1603), on James I of England in 1605 (Gunpowder Plot) and on the prominent advocate Paolo Sarpi of Venice in 1606.  In the hysterical pamphlets that circulated at the time, 'Jesuit' and 'regicide' were almost synonymous, and Mariana was accused of providing the philosophical defense and even encouraging such acts. As a result, de Mariana's thesis became an instant success de scandale, and was given more alarmist airplay than it deserved. It was banned and publicly burned in several countries, notably France and, eventually, Spain.  De Mariana's thesis was widely held up by political opponents of the Jesuits not as a personal philosophical exercise by a lonely scholar, but as a fundamental pillar of Jesuit theology, proof positive that the Jesuit Order was inherently regicidal and  destabilizing. (In an ironic twist, when the Parlement of Paris, in the aftermath of the assassination of Henry IV in 1610, tried to ban de Mariana's work anew, they ran into the obstacle that by characterizing it as Jesuit theology, rather than political philosophy, it consequently became the prerogative of the University of Paris to decide whether or not to ban it, not the Parlement.  And the Sorbonne hadn't recommended anything.) Juan de Mariana was eventually imprisoned by Spanish authorities in 1610, where he remained until almost  the end of his life. Surprisingly, it was not Mariana's defense of tyrannicide but rather his condemnation of debasement that got him charged with treason. De Mariana's works were exploited anew in future anti-Jesuit waves, notably by Titus Oates in 1678 England and, more seriously, a century later, by the powerful Portuguese minister Marquis de Pombal, after an attempt on the life of King Joseph I of Portugal in 1758.  Pombal's carefully-orchestrated propaganda campaign against 'Jesuit regicides' resurrected much material from de Mariana's thesis, and led to the expulsion of the Jesuits from Portugal, Naples, Spain and France in the 1760s and eventually the suppression of the Jesuit Order by the reluctant Pope in 1773.

Harry M. Markowitz, 1923-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/markowitz.htm," Pioneer of finance theory. Harry Markowitz obtained his Ph.D at Chicago with a dissertation on portfolio allocation, establishing modern portfolio theory (MPT).

Jacob Marschak, 1898-1977.  ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/marschak.htm," As a Russian-raised, German-taught Jewish radical, Jacob Marschak lived a life of travails.  Born in Kiev, Jacob Marschak was in his youth successively a Menshevik activist, prisoner of the Tsar, Ukranian official, minister of labor in the short-lived Cossack-Menshevik Republic of Terek in the north Caucasus - before emigrating to Berlin in 1919. At Berlin and later at Heidelberg (where he received his Ph.D. in 1922), Jacob Marschak came under the influence of the Marxian economists Bortkiewicz and Lederer.  After a period as an economics reportor, Marschak moved on to the Kiel Institute under Adolph Lowe in 1926.   In 1930, Marschak returned to Heidelberg as a lecturer.. Marschak's early work was certainly in the spirit of his masters: an anti-Austrian 1923 tract got him involved in the Socialist Calculation debate - arguing that the monopolistic tendencies of capitalism made the socialist system inevitably more efficient at pricing. This was an early signal of a topic which would emerge time and time again: the economics of organization.  His work on the ""New Middle Class"" - first a paper in 1926, then a book with Lederer in 1937 - which presented his thesis about the fall of white-collar workers from the bourgeois class (where they remained socially) to the working class (where they now were economically), became classics of interwar Marxian theory. A master of the structural growth economics of the Kiel strain, Marschak was impressed by the need for quantification of economics.  His 1931 paper on the elasticity of demand was a landmark in econometric analysis. Dismissed from his position a Heidelberg by the Nazis,  Jacob Marschak joined the stream of emigré scholars out of Germany. In 1933, Marschak moved to England, where a makeshift position as lecturer at All Souls' College, Oxford was arranged for him.  With his quantitative skills and a grant from the Rockefeller foundation, Marschak established the Oxford Institute of Statistics in 1935, and served as its first director until 1939.  With the outbreak of the war, Marschak followed Lederer and Lowe to the New School for Social Research in 1940.   While there, Marschak was instrumental in gathering together a mathematical and econometric seminar which brought together much of the fledgling quantitative community in the New York City area.  In 1943, Jacob Marschak was appointed head of the Cowles Commission during the crucial move from Colorado Springs to the University of Chicago (Marschak simultaneously took an appointment at the economics department).  Maschak held this position until 1948. As a result,  Jacob Marschak can be given credit for getting the ball rolling for the development of Neo-Walrasian economics and econometrics in the post-war era. His work with Andrews (1944) brought him to the fore of the econometric world, a theoretical explanation for employing the statistical techniques of causal analysis in the spirit of Haavelmo - what was to become the methodological groundwork of the Cowles approach. Marschak's contributions to economic theory in this phase were dominated by his interest in the concept of uncertainty. Already in his classic 1938 papers (one with Helen Makower) on monetary theory, Marschak set down the basic ideas for portfolio theory, in which risk was acknowledged to play a role.    His encounter with the work of John von Nemann and Oskar Morgenstern (1944) led him to write his famous 1950 exposition of the axiomatization of choice under uncertainty, when he introduced the infamous ""independence axiom"".  Maurice Allais's critique of the axiom led him to his famous ""normative"" defense of expected utility theory (1951). It was specifically in the theory of information, the theory of ""teams"" and decentralized organizations where Marschak was to make his name (1954, 1968, 1971, 1972). He is renowned for having developed the theory of stochastic design as a way of statistically measuring demand. It was Marschak who helped introduce modern information theory into economics via Shannon's formalization of information via the mathematical theory of communication.  Marschak's influence on colleagues and students along his itinerary was significant.  Helen Makower at Oxford, Franco Modigliani at the New School, Leonid Hurwicz and Don Patinkin at Chicago, and  Kenneth J. Arrow, Roy Radner, Lawrence Klein, Trygve Haavelmo and others at Cowles Commission, were to carry on his legacy more fully. Marschak passed on the reins of research director of Cowles Commission to Tjalling Koopmans in 1948.  Nonetheless, Marschak followed the move of Cowles from Chicago to Yale in 1955.  Marschak subsequently crossed the country in 1960, to take a position at UCLA, which he held until his death.

Alfred Marshall, 1842-1924.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/marshall.htm,"  Prominent English economist, one of the leading propagators of Neoclassical economics, founder of the ""Cambridge"" school of Neoclassicism and author of its most successful textbook, Principles of Economics (1890). Early years Alfred Marshall was born in London, of modest bourgeois background, the second son of William Marshall, a clerk at the Bank of England.  He was educated at Merchant Taylors, a non-residential private school, and acquired a school record of some distinction, demonstrating a strong early aptitude and skill for mathematics.   With the financial backing of an uncle, Marshall enrolled in St. John's College at Cambridge University in 1862, in order to pursue the Mathematical Tripos.  He ended up achieving ""second wrangler""  (second highest score in Cambridge's mathematics exam) in 1865. After a short stint as a substitute teacher in Bristol, Marshall was elected a fellow of St John's at the end of 1865.  Marshall would spend the next few years as a tutor, and was finally appointed lecturer in moral sciences at St. John's in 1868.  Marshall's intellectual interests shifted during this period.  He moved away from mathematics and grew interested in moral philosophy and ethics, then metaphysics, and eventually gravitated towards economics.  By his own account, Marshall was impelled to it by the repeated admonishment of a fellow student, in response to Marshall's grand schemes for social reform (""Ah! if you understood political economy, you would not say that."").  So, in 1867, Marshall delved into John Stuart Mill's 1848 Principles, ""got much excited about it"", and never looked back.  Marshall's reading in economics deepened during the late 1860s.  Among the Classicals, besides Mill, Marshall is certain to have gone through Adam Smith and David Ricardo.  He may also have possibly read the works of proto-marginalists Augustin Cournot (possibly)  and (less likely) Jacob von Thünen (although neither of these two are referenced in Marshall's lecture notes of this time).  Marshall would later controversially claim (in a famous 1900 letter to J.B. Clark and still later in a 1919 fragment) that he had come up with the Neoclassical theory of value on his own during this time, before reading Jevons 1871 book. The latter is safely dated, as Marshall reviewed Jevons's treatise for the Academy in 1872. As a result, most historians have dismissed Marshall's claim as an exaggerated boast.  But it is not out of the question.  Marshall had already begun translating his economic thinking into diagrams and curves.  By Marshall's account, around 1869-70, he was working on a treatise on foreign trade (never published), in the process of which he introduced his famous supply-and-demand diagram in the traditional 'inverted' form we know it today (with price on vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis -  destined to confuse every beginning student of economics for the next century!). Among the ""moral sciences"" students that passed through Marshall while he was a lecturer at St. John's College (1868-75), were Herbert S  Foxwell, John Neville Keynes, William Cunningham, John Shield  Nicholson, John Ward, Henry Cunynghame and F.W. Maitland.  From 1870, Marshall was also assigned to lecture female students at St. John's, and through that, he eventually met his future wife, Mary Paley (then a student at Newnham College).  In 1875, Alfred Marshall took an extensive tour of the United States of America,  financed by a small inheritance left by his uncle.  He got engaged to Mary Paley upon his return in 1876, and they got married in 1877.  Under Cambridge regulations then in place, marriage meant both had to resign their positions at the university. The couple moved to Bristol, where Alfred secured the positions of Foundation Principal and Professor of Political Economy at the recently-created Bristol University College (f.1876).  Bogged down by his administrative duties, Alfred assigned Mary to take over most of the work for the economics class.  This would eventually produce, Economics of Industry in 1879, a textbook authored jointly by Alfred and Mary (but historians estimate to be primarily Mary).  That same year, at the instigation of Henry Sidgwick, Marshall had two of his small tracts, Pure Theory of Foreign Trade and Pure Theory of Domestic Values, privately printed for circulation among economists.  They are the first of Marshall's works to contain diagrams - the famous Marshallian ""offer curves"" are introduced in the first, and demand-and-supply diagrams and the theory of consumer's rent, introduced in the second.   Overwork and a bout of ill-health prompted Marshall to resign from Bristol in 1880.  The couple sojourned to continental Europe, wintering in Palermo, Sicily, to help Marshal recover.  It was there that Marshall began writing what would eventually become his most famous work, the Principles of Economics, using his 1879 tract on domestic values as the kernel to a larger, wide-ranging treatise. But it would take a decade to complete.  In 1882, the Marshalls returned to England, and taught at Bristol for a year.  In 1883, Alfred Marshall was quickly appointed to replace the late Alfred Toynbee at Balliol College, Oxford.  He would remain at Oxford for two years, L.L. Price being perhaps his prize pupil there. In 1885, Alfred Marshall was elected Professor of Political Economy at Cambridge University, replacing the recently-deceased Henry Fawcett.  From this perch, Marshall would preside over Cambridge economics for the next two decades.  Marshall helped designed Balliol House, which they moved into in 1886. Marshall gave testimony to parliamentary commissions (Depression of Trade in 1886, Gold And Silver in 1887, Aged Poor in 1893, Local Finance in 1897 and Indian Currency in 1899).  He was a member of the Labour Commission (1891-94), and in 1903 wrote a significant memorandum of fiscal policy and trade (published 1908). Marshall joined the Royal Statistical Society 1880, the Political Economy Club in 1886, was elected President of Section F of the BAAS in 1890, and was the prime force behind the foundation of the British Economic Association in 1890 (Royal Economic Society from 1902). The Principles Alfred Marshall's long-gestating Principles of Economics was finally published in July, 1890. As it happens, it was the first book published in Britain with a ""net book agreement"" - that is, the publisher Macmillan decided to force booksellers to agree not to discount its price at retail.  Marshall was wary, worried that without bookseller discounts, poorer students would not be able to buy the book.  But Macmillan asserted that without the agreement, the publishers' price would be much higher.  In the end, it was agreed to sell the Principles at a fixed price of 12s 6d. The title page contained his famous epigram, ""Natura non facit saltum"" (""Nature does not make jumps"") and, more perplexingly, the appellation ""Vol. I"".  Marshall envisaged this to be merely the theoretical part, that it would be followed up by other volumes applying the theory to specific topics - foreign trade, money and banking, business cycles, growth, taxation, regulation, trade unions etc.  The Principles itself was divided into six books.  Book I (""Preliminary Survey"") is merely introductory. In the original 1890 edition, its first chapter (I.1) sets out the scope and method of economics, with its famous opening definition: ""Political Economy, or Economics, is the study of man's actions in the ordinary business of life"" ( p.1, later changed in the 4th ed. to ""the study of mankind"", p.1).  Its second chapter (I.2) was a brief synopsis of general economic history, from ancient Mesopotamia to the French Revolution, the third (I.3) a narrower history of Britain's rise as a commercial and industrial power, including the emergence of the market system and capitalist enterprise.  The fourth chapter (I.4) contains a brief history of economic thought. Here, Marshall lionizes Adam Smith but is a bit critical of David Ricardo, whom he characterizes as ""narrow"". He lauds John Stuart Mill as the first to begin moving away from the mechanical view of man, incorporating the ""pliability of human nature"" and its dependence on economic circumstances, an insight for which Marshall credits the advances in ""biological sciences"" and the critiques by socialists.  He laments the dogmatism surrounding Mill and the Classical school, and acknowledges the recent opening of new avenues - explicitly mentioning the marginalism of W.S. Jevons, the historicism of T.E. Cliffe-Leslie and the contributions of Walter Bagehot and J.E. Cairnes. Among French economists, he lauds Cournot, (""a constructive thinker of the highest genius"". p.67) and gives a tip of the hat to a bevy of French socialists.  He only mentions Carey among Americans, and only List among Germans - although he warmly lauds the German Historical School for overcoming the narrowness of economic theory and emphasizing the evolution of institutions (""one of the great achievements of our age"", p.70).  He also refers to the ideas of Karl Marx (albeit not by name).   The fifth chapter (I.5) is on methodology, on the appropriate balance of facts and theory, inductive versus deductive methods, forwarding that  ""facts by themselves are silent, they teach nothing until they are interpreted by reason"" (p.74). The sixth chapter (I.6) engages in apologetics for ""rational economic man"", excusing the focus on the selfish motive as being merely due to measurability. The seventh chapter (I.7) continues on the methodological track, briefly explaining the meaning of ""economic law"", and reminding that it is morally neutral and only hypothetical.  In his summary eighth chapter (I.8), Marshall situates his Principles in the space between the narrowly theoretical Ricardian tradition and amorphous empirical Historicist tradition, he defends the need to first decipher economic laws before applying them to practical policy problems, and sets out two rather long list of questions (one theoretical, the other practical) which economics seeks to address (p.95ff).  [Changes: many of the original chapters of Book I were completely rewritten, and some purged in later editions of the book. By the final (8th, 1920) edition, Chs.2 & 3 had been moved to Appendix A, Ch. 4 became Appendix B, Ch. 5 was removed, and the discussion rewritten and expanded into two essays - one comparing economics to biology and other sciences (App  C) and another on abstraction ( App. D).  Chapters 6, 7 and 8 were completely rewritten and became Chs. 3 and 4. [Quick ref links: 1st 1890 ed: Book I chapters I.1, I.2, I.3, I.4, I.5, I.6, I.7, I.8; 8th 1920 ed. Book I chapters: I.1, I.2, I.3, I.4, App. A, App. B,  App. C, App. D] Book II (""Some Fundamental Notions"") is still preliminary, dedicated to providing definitions of economic terms.  Its opening chapter (II.1) is perhaps an overlong defense of the right to use economic terms and definitions.  The second chapter (II.2) gets to the various definitions of ""wealth"" - exchangeable vs. non-exchangeable, etc. Unlike prior economists (e.g. Senior), Marshall does not limit the scope of economics to any particular definition.  The third chapter (II.3) dismisses old distinctions between productive and unproductive labor or enterprise - all economic activity is productive of ""utilities"", albeit some more indirectly than others (e.g. building capital goods).  The fourth chapter (II.4) tries to define various types of consumer goods (necessaries for existence, for efficiency, by convention, luxuries, etc). The fifth chapter (II.5) defines ""capital"", including an extended bibliographical note (p.135) and the sixth chapter (II.6) defines ""income"".   [Changes: By the final (8th, 1920) edition, Chs 3 & 4 are combined into Ch.3, and Chs. 5 & 6 flipped and combined into Ch. 4, with the bibliographical note on capital exiled to App. E.

Book II chapters: II.1, II.2, II.3, II.4, App. E] Book III (""Demand or Consumption"", later re-titled ""On Wants and Their Satisfaction"") is the beginning of the actual economics. The core of this book was already in his 1879 Theory of Domestic Values.  The first chapter (III.1) justifies treating demand first, emphasizing the over-arching importance given to utility by the recent marginalist revolution, and how it was neglected in classical economics. The second chapter (III.2) gives the ""Law of Demand"" - finally introducing ""desirability or utility"", and inserts diminishing marginal utility without much fanfare.  He avoids ""utils"" as a measure, and instead uses a monetary stick, the ""willingness to pay"", as a measure of marginal utility. He notes that this varies across people and incomes - although asserts these differences can be buried in averages. He makes special note of impatience and utility discounting over time. Curiously, while Marshall starts out by explaining how demand is a quantity conditional on price, he goes on to draw a demand curve with quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis (p.157), and states the general definition in the inverse form (""a person's demand for a thing as represented by a schedule of prices at which he is willing to buy different amounts of it"").  He makes note of shifts, and explains the importance of substitute goods. Marshall calls its downward-sloping shape the ""Law of Diminution of Marginal Demand Price"" and explains it inversely (""the greater the amount to be sold, the smaller will be the price at which it will find purchasers""). Thus his diagram is  justified by his use of an inverse demand function. Marshall's unintuitive reversal of the axes shall be the bane of every beginning economics student for the next century.   In this chapter, Marshall mainly references Bentham, Jevons and Edgeworth, but eventually gets around to also mentioning Gossen, Menger and Böhm-Bawerk.  Surprisingly, Cournot is not credited for the demand curve, and instead Marshall prefers to discuss Mill and a confused note in Cairnes.   In the third chapter (III.3) Marshall introduces the ""elasticity of demand"". He notes how elasticity varies along the demand curve - asserting it is inelastic at very high and very low prices, and quite elastic at intermediary prices..He also explains the relative inelasticity of necessary goods.  At one point, Marshall makes uses the numerical example of Gregory King (p.167), and goes into discussion on the difficulties of collecting demand statistics.  In the fourth chapter (III.4), Marshall  introduces his 1879 ""consumers' surplus"", or as he calls it here, ""Consumers' Rent"" (""the excess of the price which he would be willing to pay rather than go without it, over that which he actually does pay"", p.175).  He goes on to connect this measure with the utility of Jevons (and makes note of Bernoulli's contribution) [Changes: In the later editions, Marshall inserts a discussion on socio-cultural basis of wants (essentially a reiteration of his earlier ""necessaries"") as Ch.2, thus pushing Ch.2 (demand) forward to Ch.3.  The old Ch.3 (elasticity) becomes Ch. 4, while the discussion on current versus deferred uses is spinned off and expanded into its own Ch.5.  Old Ch. 4 (consumers surplus) now becomes Ch. 6.

Among the significant changes in the second edition (1891) is the introduction of the ""representative firm"".  It would go through more changes, passing through eight editions overall. The Principles was not written as a textbook, nor was not pedagogically-geared towards classroom instruction. Marshall subsequently put out his Elements of of Economics of Industry in 1892, essentially an abridged and simplified version of the Principles, geared for beginning students and the wider public.  But it was the Principles that would become the major treatise and bring English Neoclassicism to universities everywhere. Later years At Cambridge University, Marshall increased the prominence of economics in the Moral Sciences Tripos and the History Tripos, and later pushed Cambridge to create the separate ""Economics and Political Sciences"" Tripos.  The new tripos was approved by the university in 1903, and began in 1905. Marshall retired in 1908.  Against expectations, Marshall recommended Arthur Cecil Pigou rather than Herbert Foxwell as his successor as Professor of Political Economy at Cambridge.. In retirement, Marshall set about completing his long-planned companion volumes of the Principles, applying the basic theory to specific areas.  But increasing illness and other distractions, progress was slow.   The first companion volume, Industry and Trade, only appeared in 1919.  The second, Money, Credit and Commerce, in 1923.  But by this time, Marshall was already thoroughly incapacitated, senility (possibly Alzheimer's) having set in firmly by 1921, it is suspected the latter volume (if not also the first) was in fact cobbled together by Mary Paley.   A third contemplated volume, on economic progress, never went beyond a rough draft.   Marshall died on July 13, 1924.

Mary Paley Marshall, 1850-1944.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/paleymarshall.htm," English Neoclassical economist and wife of Alfred Marshall.  Mary Paley was a descendant of the  utilitarian philosopher and theologian William Paley.  Mary Paley would go on to become one of the first female students at Cambridge University.  She enrolled at the women's residence Sidgwick had established in 1871 (what would eventually becom become Newnham College, Cambridge).  She completed the Moral Sciences Tripos in 1874, achieving top marks, but could not receive a degree on account of her gender.  Paley was a lecturer in economics at Newnham College until 1876.  Mary Paley married her former economics teacher, Alfred Marshall, in 1876.  In 1885, the couple returned to Cambridge, and Paley resumed her lectureship at Newnham College.  Her lectures were compiled and published as Economics of Industry, with her husband as co-author (although the extent of his participation remains ambiguous). Mary Paley is frequently supposed to have had actively participated in the composition of Alfred Marshall's Principles, however there is little evidence to confirm that.

Harriet Martineau,   1802-1876,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/martineau.htm," 


English writer, economist and popularizer of Classical Ricardian economics. Harriet Martineau was born into a large Norwich family of Huguenot extraction.  Her father, Thomas Martineau, was a textile (bombazine and camlet) manufacturer. Despite the large brood  (she was the sixth child out of eight), Harriet obtained a thorough, if brief, education (""solid rather than showy"").  Much of it was obtained at home, but part of her teens were spent in formal boarding school in Bristol.  She did not evince promises of future brilliance nor receive much encouragement in her youth  - sickly, timid, dutiful and overlooked in the family, Harriet struggled under the thumb of an overbearing mother and critical elder brothers. Partially deaf from a childhood disease, Martineau took to writing early on for self-amusement, critical to developing her talent as a writer.  The lonely deaf girl from Norwich would go on to become one of the most influential economic writers of the age. Harriet's younger brother was the famous Unitarian minister and philosopher James Martineau. The intellectual contrast between them could hardly be greater - James the sensitive divine idealist of the past, Harriet the skeptical practical examiner of the future.  Martineau began her intellectual life sharing those strong religious leanings.  Around 1822, after her abbreviated schooling, Harriet met John Hugh Worthington, a divinity student and friend of James's from Manchester New College in York, to whom she would be briefly engaged.  Her frustration at not being able deepen her theological studies at a college, like her brother and fiancé, may have prompted Martineau to publish her first piece on female divines in 1822, under the pen-name ""Discipulus"", for the Monthly Repository, a small Unitarian journal with which she would have a long association.  Her second article, a plea to open higher education for women, was written in a male voice.  In 1823, she published her first book, Devotional Exercises, signing it merely as ""a lady"", and covering some deep theological topics, like the doctrine of necessity.  It was something of a success in the Unitarian community and ran through several editions.  She followed this up with another religious book, Addresses, Prayers and Hymns in 1826.   However, Martineau family fortunes soon took a turn for the worse.  It began with the outbreak of war in Spain in 1823, nearly bankrupting her father, who had shipments tied up there.  This was followed by the death of her eldest brother Thomas, a physician, in 1824.  Then came the financial crisis of 1825, wiping out much of the family's remaining wealth and leaving them swamped by debts.  Then, in 1826, came the death of her broken father.  This was followed quickly by difficulties of her fiancé Worthington - by now a  unitarian minister in Manchester.  Mental illness and dissolution led Worthington to commit suicide in 1826.  It was her first and last engagement - Harriet would remain unmarried for the rest of her life. To make matters worse, Harriet Martineau, always of a sickly disposition, had grown increasingly deaf.  With James then at university, the remainder of family had to scramble to make ends meet. Hoping to make some extra pennies from her pen, Harriet Martineau contacted Houlston, a publisher for the religious mass market.  Martineau submitted a few fancifully-written tales she had lying around. Houlston agreed to pay her five guineas for each she could produce, publishing them as small volumes of Sunday school-style storybooks.   She ended up producing nearly a dozen.  It was anonymous hack-work, but it brought in some much-needed money.  At Houlston's request, she wrote a larger story, Principle and Practice (1827), which had strong autobiographical elements. Two of her 1827 Houlston storybooks - The Rioters and The Turn-Out - touched on themes of political economy (Luddites and Wages, respectively).  She was not really familiar with economics then, having only an intuitive grasp gleaned from newspapers.  It was then that Martineau decided to learn it and picked up Jane Marcet's Conversations on Political Economy.  Marcet was a eye-opener, not only for introducing Martineau to the field, but also for demonstrating how it could be usefully conveyed by narrative tales. In early 1828, on her doctor's orders, Martineau took a brief pause from her writing. But upon the appeal of the William Johnston Fox,  the unitarian preacher and new editor of the Monthly Repository, she began submitting articles - a steady stream of essays, poems and reviews -  in the latter half of 1828 straight through 1832.  Her contributions to the Monthly were mostly unpaid and anonymous (usually delivered in a male voice and signed by ""V""). The Martineau family hit rock bottom in June 1829, when their textile business (under the guidance of her brother Henry since their father's death) finally went bankrupt, leaving them no means of support.  Her elder sisters were packed off as governesses,  but the sickly Harriet could not. Martineau and her mother took in needlepoint work to make ends meet.  Desperately appealing to Fox for compensation, he managed to provide Harriet with a small fixed salary of £15 per year.  Later that year, Fox found her a proofreading job with a London printer at a more generous salary, but she turned it down, unable to abandon her mother in Norwich.  In another setback, she wrote another book around this time, Life of Howard, on commission from Henry Brougham's Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (SDUK), on a promised payment of £30.  But there was some confusion - the manuscript was lost in Brougham's offices (it later re-appeared, cribbed wholesale into the publication of another writer (Hepworth Dixon?); Martineau went unpaid). In between needlepoint and unpaid monthly articles, in 1830, Martineau produced Traditions of Palestine, the first work in which her own name appeared as author, and probably her biggest success thus far.  Around this time, the proselytizing Unitarian Association opened up three essay competitions, inviting writers to submit essays communicating the Unitarian message to Roman Catholics, Jews and Muslims.  Martineau submitted essays that won all three competitions. However grand her reputation was now among Unitarians, Martineau's reach was still confined to a narrow sectarian community. She attempted to reach out to a wider audience with her Jane Austenesque novel Five Years of Youth, but it was not a success.  By late 1831, having gone beyond Marcet to read Adam Smith and other economists, Martineau began planning a series of stories to illustrate the principles of political economy. Martineau's attempts to find a publisher met with failure (allegedly, James Mill was consulted  by a publisher on the project and advised against it, arguing that the narrative tales were unsuited for such a serious topic). Nonetheless, her old publisher W.J. Fox persuaded his brother, Charles Fox, to give it a shot.  The latter agreed, wrote up a contract with Martineau and began to collect subscribers. In early 1832, Martineau's Illustrations of Political Economy began appearing, and, by 1834, she would put out 25 volumes in the series.  Unlike Marcet, she did not attempt to ""smother it"" in stories, but to expose economics systematically in a series of narratives. Her greatest intellectual influence was James Mill's Elements --whose order of topics she basically followed.  The volumes also contained the indelible democratic imprint of her reading of Jeremy Bentham.   Martineau was thoroughly ""Ricardian"" in her economics and ""necessarianist"" in her philosophy (which saw education as the salvation of society). She was also a doctrinaire supporter the wages-fund doctrine. Martineau's Illustrations were a sensation. Volume after volume sold out instantly, at home and abroad.  Jane Marcet, James Mill (now repentant), Richard Whately and Robert Malthus praised her work.  Henry Brougham  remarked that his entire stable of SDUK writers had not nearly as much sense as ""that deaf little girl from Norwich"". In November, 1832, after eight numbers of the series were published, Martineau moved to London,  where her mother soon joined her.  There, she concentrated on finishing the volumes and held court to London society: economists, reform activists, and politicians of every stripe called upon her and flooded her mail, requesting her to emphasize some theoretical principle or political cause in her stories : Henry Brougham badgered her to take up Poor Law reform; Lord Althorp, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, sent his secretary to provide her with details of his upcoming budget; the Royal Commission on Excise Taxes provided her with a draft of their report before they had officially submitted it - all in the hope that she would take it up in her Illustrations. Martineau took her share of criticism too.  The Tory Quarterly Review denounced her work as crude apologism and for baldly serving the Whig agenda.  When she ventured a volume on the sensitive issue of Ireland, the Dublin press savaged her.  Her 12th volume, which contained critical comments of the French monarchy, led to the cancellation of an official French plan (arranged by her new friend, Marcet) to introduce translations of Martineau's books into the French state school curriculum.  Her works were banned in Russia and Austria-Hungary after she constructed one story (13th, Charmed Sea) around Polish exiles in a Siberian labor camp (she sought to illustrate the spontaneous emergence of money from barter). As the series wound down in 1834, Brougham prevailed on her to take up Poor Law reform in a new series, Poor Laws and Paupers Illustrated and, having dashed off that, Martineau was soon at work on still another, Illustrations of Taxation. Although ill and deaf, Martineau continued writing indefatigably, promoting notorious causes such as the abolitionist movement and the establishment of the Poor Laws.   Although pro-laissez-faire and pro-direct taxation, she also defended the right to unionize and strike (rare for most political economists of the time).  Even then, liberals such as John Stuart Mill ""shuddered"" at the way Martineau translated Ricardian political economy into an apologist doctrine.  After the 1830s, Martineau would return only occasionally to her youthful passion, political economy.   Age emboldened her: Martineau's now-classic 1837 Society in America was vigorous in its critique of American society.   In 1839 she tried her hand at a novel (Deerbrook) and then went on to history (1841, 1849) and even hypnotism (1844). Her anti-religious 1851 treatise was rather controversial.  Her 1853 translation of Auguste Comte's Cours de philosophie positive is largely responsible for bringing his ideas to Great Britain.  Her work on the Indian crisis (1857, 1858) encouraged the introduction of natives in the colonial civil service, urging that British aim should be ""developing India for the Indians"". (1858: p.98).  Around 1858, she ceased her connection with the Westminster Review, and took up writing for the Edinburgh Review. Her 1859 book on the sanitary condition of the army was written for Florence Nightingale.  In 1859  she also began writing for the American Anti-Slavery Standard

James Martineau, 1805-1900,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/jamesmartineau.htm,"  The English Unitarian theologian and philosopher, who's inclusion on this site is due to his popularization of hedonic philosophy and his coincidental relationships with multiple economists. Born into a Norwich textile manufacturing family of Huguenot descent, James Martineau was the younger brother of the economist Harriet Martineau (they were the sixth and seventh of a large brood.)  Non-conformist (Unitarian) by faith, James was given a thorough, if brief, education, rounded off by two years at the dissenting Bristol school established by the Unitarian minister Lant Carpenter.  Exhibiting an early penchant for mathematics, at his father's request, Martineau ended his studies and was apprenticed to a civil engineer in Derby for a year.  But the lure of faith and theology kept dogging him, prompting him to abandon his scientific vocation and pursue a calling as a Unitarian minister. To this end, in 1822, Martineau enrolled in Manchester New College, a  non-conformist academy, then at York.  This turned out to be a strenuous expense, coinciding with an extremely difficult period in his family's fortunes. After completing his studies in 1827, Martineau spent a year filling in for his sickly old teacher Carpenter at the Bristol School, and was invited to take over the job.  But Martineau was eager for pastoral work.  He finally found a vacancy in Ireland, and, in 1828, Martineau was ordained and took up duties at the Eustace Street Presbyterian Church in Dublin.  In 1832, entering a quarrel over regium domum, Martineau resigned from Dublin, and moved to Liverpool.  In 1836, Martineau published his Rationale of Religious Enquiry, raising reason as the ultimate arbiter of religious truth, and setting him on the road to his future explorations on the relationship between religion and human conscience.  The book making him a minor public celebrity. James Martineau was appointed the first Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy and Political Economy at Manchester New College (MNC) in 1840.  In 1853, MNC moved to London. A semi-formal deal was eventually struck with her old rival, University College London (UCL), whereby MNC would concentrate on theology and related topics, while UCL would take care of the secular courses.  Unwilling to leave his Liverpool home and pulpit, Martineau spent four years commuting the distance, until finally moving to London in 1857.  His course of lectures included Ethics, Philosophy of Religion and, a weaker spot, Logic (assigning Hamilton, Mill, Bain and Aristotle). In 1858, Edward Taggart, the Unitarian minister of Little Portland Street Chapel, died.  Martineau was appointed jointly with jointly with John James Taylor, the principal of MNC, to succeed Taggart in the pulpit.  When Taylor died in 1869, Martineau succeeded him both as principal of MNC and sole minister at the chapel. Philip H. Wicksteed was among Martineau's first students in London and his successor at the Little Portland Street Chapel.  W. Stanley Jevons attended Martineau's course at MNC in late 1860, later proving instrumental in familiarizing Jevons with utilitarian philosophy.

Karl Marx, 1818-1883 ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/marx.htm," German economist, philosopher and socialist revolutionary, founder of Marxian economics. Karl Marx was born on May 5, 1818 in the Rhineland city of Trier, then part of the Kingdom of Prussia. Marx was of German Jewish descent.  His grandfather Marx Levi, had been a prominent rabbi in Trier.  Karl's father, Heinrich Marx, a lawyer, had formally converted to Lutheran Christianity in 1824 to advance his legal career.  Karl was his second son, but after the first died, became the eldest of the surviving brood of seven children (Karl had a younger brother and five sisters). Trier had been under French occupation during the revolutionary wars.  Heinrich Marx was an ardent enthusiast of the French Enlightenment and great admirer of Voltaire and Rousseau, and gave young Karl a largely secular irreligious upbringing. The young Marx was also greatly influenced by the Baron Ludwig von Westphalen, a prominent Prussian aristocrat and official in Trier, the father of one of his school-friends. Von Westphalen was also an Enlightenment liberal, and much taken by the bright young Karl, served as an early mentor, practically a second father. Berlin
 
Karl Marx was educated in the schools of Trier, and enrolled at the nearby University of Bonn in 1835. Marx's early passion for literature and philosophy was overruled by his father, who insisted he study law. Bored by his studies at Bonn, Marx delved into extracurricular activities - drinking, dueling, student politics and getting in trouble with the police. In an effort to get his son to buckle down, away from bad influences, Heinrich allowed young Karl to transfer to the University of Berlin in 1836. Karl Marx flourished in Berlin  - not that he found law at the University of Berlin any more attractive than it had been at Bonn, but Berlin had more stimulating offerings in other departments. Marx was particularly taken by the philosophy lectures of the charismatic young Bruno Bauer, then the leading figure of the ""Young Hegelians"".  The Young Hegelians were a group of followers of the late Berlin professor and philosopher Georg W.F. Hegel (Hegel had died only recently, in 1831).  Hegel had articulated a complex philosophy around the concept of ""alienation"" - that is, the disconnect between the ""subject"" (roughly, man's consciousness) and ""object"" (the real world around him).  Hegel had posited that man's understanding of reality is a matter of ideas, but that these ideas are constantly changing and being re-interpreted by a process he called ""dialectic"".  The Young Hegelians, like Bruno Bauer and Ludwig Feuerbach, had adopted Hegel's methods, but were uncomfortable with Hegel's relentless idealism. Hegel had emphasized the primacy of human ideas in determining the shape of society and the course of history, but the Young Hegelians began to reverse that, and suggesting that it was social conditions that determined human ideas (what they called ""naturalism""). Marx came into the Young Hegelian circle in 1837 and began to absorb all this heady stuff.  After his father's death in 1838, Marx's means were straitened, but the parental constraints on his activities were also lifted.  Marx assisted Bauer in editing a new edition of Hegel's Philosophy of Religion (1840).  Marx went on to write a doctoral thesis on the Greek atomist philosophers, elevating Epicurus over Democritus. Fearing his Berlin professors might object to its content, Marx instead submitted the thesis at the University of Jena (known to be more relaxed), which awarded him his Ph.D. in 1841. Marx soon began making plans to follow Bauer and take up a lectureship in Bonn. By this time, the Young Hegelians were drifting into politics. Despite their turn towards naturalism, they still believed that change in society came through change in ideas. As a result, many Young Hegelians believed reform in conservative Prussia could be brought about by people like themselves challenging existing ideas about the social, religious and political order.  The ascension of King Frederick William IV to the Prussian throne in 1840 seemed to promise a new era of liberalism - or at least many young Germans hoped. But it turned out to be illusory, and censorship was actually ratcheted up. The Young Hegelians were suspected and targeted by the obnoxious Prussian authorities - their journals and newspapers were censored  and academic and civil posts blocked. When Bauer's lectureship at Bonn was terminated, Marx realized his own chances there were nil.. Cologne Giving up the idea of an academic career, Marx turned to journalism.  He moved to Cologne and became chief editor of a new liberal newspaper, the Rheinische Zeitung (""Rhine Gazette"") in October, 1842.  At this stage, Marx's convictions were largely as a classical liberal, and consonant with the commercial interests that funded the newspaper.  Marx's editorials, principally in defense of freedom of the press and other civil liberties, were stridently critical of what he perceived to be a disappointingly conservative Prussian government.  Marx's bold attacks prompted the Prussian authorities to dedicate a special censor in Cologne to observe the newspaper, and find a basis to shut it down. But Marx was quite careful in his wording, and managed to escape two legal suits. Finally, in early January 1843, the wearied government simply decreed that the Rheinishe Zeitung should shut down at the end of the quarter.  Marx had resigned in advance in the hopes of saving it, but the RZ was wrapped up by March. Two months later,  Karl Marx married Jenny von Westphalen.  A childhood friend from Trier, Jenny was the daughter of his early mentor, the Baron von Westphalen.  The match raised some eyebrows, given Jenny's aristocratic background and Marx's lower social status and ethnic roots.  But her liberal-minded father blessed the match, and after a seven-year engagement (begun in 1836), Karl and Jenny were finally married in Kreuznach on June 19, 1843. Marx and his new bride moved to Paris in November 1843.    Paris The sojourn in Paris was a momentous phase of Marx's life - even though it turned out be short, little more than a year.  Over the summer of 1843, Marx had planned with the Young Hegelian publicist Arnold Ruge to launch the Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher, a new German-language journal to be published abroad to escape Prussian censorship.  Although Zurich had been Ruge's first choice, Marx insisted on Paris. Marx's growing interest in politics had made him aware he needed to get a better grasp of economics and there was probably no better place to study it than in Paris.  Marx was also curious to explore the budding socialist movement in France (recently brought to widespread attention in Germany by Lorenz von Stein's 1842 work).  The Marxes (and Ruge) took up residence at 38 Rue Vaneau (gmap) in Paris. Several other German expatriates also lived in the building and were frequent guests in Marx's apartment - notably, the poet Heinrich Heine and the radical activist German Mäurer, leader of the proto-communist League of the Just (Bund der Gerechten).  Through them, Marx became personally acquainted with, and consorted with. a variety of radical writers and leaders of political movements, both German and French.  Marx's lifelong conversion to socialism was effected here.  Due to disagreements between Ruge and Marx, the Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher was dissolved after its first and only number (February 1844). But the issue contained two notable articles by Marx already pointing in his future direction.  The first criticzed Bruno Bauer's thesis on Jewish emancipation,. Bauer had argued that anti-Semitism could be overcome by separating church and state. Marx replied the problem was not caused by the state, but rooted in civil society, and that only by first changing the underlying social conditions could emancipation be achieved.   Marx's second DFJ article was an introduction to a projected larger work criticizing Hegel's Philosophy of Right. Hegel's political philosophy had posited that the State was a determinant of ideas in society, whereas Marx argued that it was society that created the State and infused it with their ideas.  While Hegel saw the State civil service possessing a universal point of view, transcending the particularist conflicts of different social groups, Marx saw them as merely tools to protect the interests of the dominant classes.  Marx concluded that political reform in Prussia was impossible, everyone was too closely invested in the current order, and that change could only come about by a revolution from below.  It is here that Marx first identified the existence of a new social class that seemed to be emerging in the rising industrial centers in France - the urban working class, the ""proletariat"".  As it was a novel class that had no obvious space in the old social order, Marx boldly identified the proletariat as the conduit for change.  As its numbers increased and their consciousness of their social condition became sharper, Marx conjectured the proletariat would begin demanding change, not merely political reform, but a complete overthrowing of the existing order and social relations. He predicted the proletarian revolution would start in France, where industrial conditions were more advanced, and then spill over into Germany.  ""The day of German resurrection will be announced by the crowing of the Gallican cock"" (p.85).  That same issue of the DFJ contained a couple of articles by another German expatriate, Friedrich Engels, at that time a manager in his father's textile factory in Manchester, England. Marx and Engels finally met in September 1844, when Engels came on a short visit to Paris.  Although they had met once before (in the RZ offices in Cologne), it was this Paris visit that marked the beginning of their close friendship and lifelong collaboration.  At the time, Engels was better versed in economics, and certainly had a deeper empirical knowledge of industrial capitalism and workers' movements (Engels's 1844 DFJ contributions were preludes to his famous 1845 study of the conditions of the English working class).   But Marx was catching up.  As part of his research on Hegel's theory of the State, Marx was undertaking a crash course in economics, reading Adam Smith, Jean-Baptiste Say, James Mill, as well as immersing himself in French socialist literature.  Marx was particularly impressed by Smith's account of the division of labor, and was trying at the time to combine it with Hegelian theory.  In his Paris manuscripts (which would be later be collected and published in 1932 as the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844), Marx decided to explain the Hegelian theory of alienation in terms of economic relationships.  Marx argued that alienation was brought about not by inadequate consciousness (as Hegel had assumed), but by the material situation.  Specifically, Marx posited that the emergence of private property and division of labor had brought about four dimensions of alienation - the estrangement of the laborer from his product, his estrangement from the production process, his estrangement from his own humanity and his estrangement from society.  It is for this reason, Marx concluded, that the proletariat was the revolutionary class - not only did they have a compelling interest to overthrow the existing order, but by being completely alienated, they were the only ones with nothing to lose. Shortly after meeting Engels, Marx abandoned the grand Hegel project and launched a new one with Engels focused on some recent writings of the Young Hegelians.  The first collaborative work between Marx and Engels was the treatise on the Holy Family (1845), a critique of Ludwig Feuerbach's theory of religion.  A Young Hegelian, Feuerbach had posited that religion was an obstacle to consciousness, and that once it was removed, human ideals would be realized on earth.  But Marx and Engels argued that religion was no obstacle, that the real obstacle, the roots of alienation, lay in material economic conditions.  Religious ideals merely echoed difficulties on earth, and emancipation from religion would achieve nothing by itself, without changes in the underlying economic circumstances. And once the material circumstances changed, then the need for religion would disappear naturally.  This was the first cogent expression (in print) of Marx's materialism and the beginning of his break with the Young Hegelians. Brussels After the DFJ had gone defunct, Marx took to contributing and editing Vorwärts!, a German-language magazine that was launched in 1844 by Heine and other radical exiles in Paris.  Its unbridled attacks on the Prussian government drew the attention of the authorities.  In January 1845, after pressure by the Prussian embassy (reportedly delivered by the cultural attaché in Paris, Alexander von Humboldt), the French minister François Guizot suppressed the magazine and issued an order expelling Marx from France.  Marx and his family moved to Brussels in February, 1845 where they would remain for the next three years..  Engels visited Brussels in April 1845, and would stay with the Marxes on and off until August 1846.  It was here that Marx and Engels began their work as political activists, establishing the ""Communist Corresponding Committee"" in Brussels.  Although principally oriented to the community of immigrant German artisans and workers in Belgium, the intention was to put the leaders of disparate working class movements in various European countries in contact with each other, as a prelude to the formation of a general political movement.  During the summer of 1845, Marx and Engels traveled to England together, to meet German expatriate workers there, as well as make contact with English Chartist leaders.  Marx's knowledge of the British economy and economic thinking was deepened during this sojourn (it was here that Marx came across the works of the English Ricardian Socialists) During the Brussels period, Marx and Engels produced their second collaborative work, The German Ideology, often regarded as marking the transition of Marx from young philosopher to the mature social scientist.  The definitive epistemological break with the Young Hegelians can be dated in April 1845, when Marx drafted his eleven ""Theses on Feuerbach"" (what would become the first chapter of the German Ideology).  Although the rest of the manuscript was finished by the Spring of 1846, Marx and Engels were unable to find a publisher, and so set the manuscript aside in June 1846 (the German Ideology was first published in the 1930s).  In the German Ideology, Marx and Engels expounded more generally on their theory of historical materialism, and introduced many of the building bricks of future Marxian thought. Their first part emphasizes  the superiority of Marx's materialism over the naturalism of Feuerbach and the Young Hegelians.  Feuerbach was right to reverse Hegel, but had not gone far enough. Feuerbach's historical man, who constructs ideas, although materialist in conception, is still too abstract, living in an abstract situation,  almost some state of nature of the philosopher's imagination, and as a result, his ideas are also abstract, and really owe more to the philosopher's own sentimental humanist ideals. Moreover, naturalism is inherently static - it leaps from circumstances to ideas in one leap,  and does not account for how changing circumstances can and have changed ideas over time. The understanding of historical man, Marx and Engels insisted, needs to be embedded in real history, the historical situation of his real circumstances, as they actually have been, and the changes they have undergone over time.  This requires serious, deep research into the facts of economic history, not conjectural anthropology.   But a correct interpretation is not enough.   Marx and Engels derided the Young Hegelian confidence in ideas being sufficient to bring about reform.   Positing new interpretations, demanding changes in people's consciousness,  combating old ideas with new ideas, is merely fighting with shadows with shadows.  It will have no effect if they do not also address the underlying economic situation and engage with those actually capable of  bringing about change (like the proletarian movements).. As Marx famously notes, ""The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it."" Marx and Engels' reserved the second part of the German Ideology to criticize contemporary strands of socialism.   Although he has little affection for the ""utopianism"" of French socialist thinkers like Fourier and Cabet, and the more limited vision of Saint-Simon, Marx reserves his criticism primarily for German commentators on French socialism.  He accuses them of failing to grasp the significance of working class movements, and treating socialist literature (immature as it may be) like just another intellectual exercise. (This is the only part of the German Ideology that made it into print). A major reason behind writing of the German Ideology was not merely to criticize German philosophers, but also for Marx and Engels to advertise their new political project to them.  The German Ideology was supposed to provide the ""scientific"" foundations of the Brussels Corresponding Committee.  Marx and Engels dedicate a good portion of the text giving an outline of the historical development of feudalism and its transition to capitalism and spend a perhaps inordinate amount of time describing an upcoming ""communist revolution"".  This is the first time both these ideas were set down, and they have a perceptible  ""first draft"" feel - clogged, inchoate and rough.   As Marx would later note, the book really served more as an exercise in ""self-clarification"" than communication (Zur Kritik, 1859: p.13-14).  Nonetheless, the basic underlying ideas of Marxian thought are already here - in particular, the dialectic of historical materialism.  It explains how productive forces determine social relations (called ""forms of intercourse"" here), how productive forces develop and eventually come into contradiction with the original social relations, and how these contradictions are eventually resolved by social revolutions. This resolution, of course, is not permanent - it merely sets up a new historical phase of development, which goes through the same pattern.  In the German Ideology, the development of productive forces are measured in terms of division of labor, which have their social counterpart in historical forms of property relations (tribal, communal, feudal, bourgeois), from which derive social classes and ""superstructure"" elements like the State and ideology.  They dote on the final phase of bourgeois capitalism, explaining its transition from guild structures to large-scale factory systems, and how it sets up the conditions for a proletarian revolution, which will culminate in ""communism"", the abolition of private property, and consequently an end to the division of labor, classes and the State.  The finality of communism is premised on the observation that the proletariat created by bourgeois capitalism is the only class created in history without property to fall back upon, and consequently the ""last class"" in history. Although the German Ideology manuscript was unpublished, Marx made his public break with ""sentimental socialists"" in print.  Its second part on 'true socialism' found its way into anonymous articles in the Die Westfälischer Dampfboot in 1846-47. But the first clear announcement of Marx's new ideas in print was in 1847, when Marx wrote his polemical Poverty of Philosophy (the only work Marx wrote in French). It was a critique of the recent book of French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (called Philosophy of Poverty - a title Marx satirically inverted)  Although Proudhon and Marx had been friendly in Paris, Marx's critique of Proudhon's book was scathing. Marx uses the review to outline of his own theory of historical materialism, and mercilessly mocks Proudhon's failure to grasp both economics and historical change. He accuses Proudhon for continuing to embrace natural ""eternal laws"" and failing to see that social life is grounded in economic life, and that notions such as property (Proudhon's touchstone) change with historical epoch.  Marx dismisses Proudhon's entire work as naive, trivial and pretentious.  Marx's diatribe was sensational, and helped popularize Marx's name well beyond German exile circles.  Clearly, the review of Proudhon was being used as a platform for Marx to state his own, growing views. Given that his prior manuscripts did not make it to print, Marx would later note that it was in the Misery of Philosophy that ""the leading points of our theory were first presented scientifically, though in polemic form""  (1859, p.14).  But the scornful ferocity of the attack left a deep bitterness between the two men.   1848 In January 1847, Marx and Engels were invited by the League of the Just, a German working class organization formed back in 1836, to draw up a new program.  Engels brought their program to League's congress in London in June, 1847, where it was adopted. The League of the Just and the Brussels Corresponding Committee were merged into a new organization, recast as the ""Communist League"" (Bund der Kommunisten), and adopted the now-famous motto ""Working men of all countries, unite!"".  At the League's second London conference later that year (November, 1847), attended by both Marx and Engels, they were asked to transform the program into a manifesto.   In the meantime,  that same summer, Marx organized expatriate German workers in Brussels into the German Workers' Society (Deutschen Arbeiter Vereins, DAV), and took editorial control of the Deutsche-Brüsseler-Zeitung, effectively the paper of the new communist movement.  That December, Marx delivered a set of lectures on economics before the DAV (what would be later printed in 1849 as Wage Labour and Capital, explaining the evolution of labor from slavery, to serfdom to wage labor). The Communist Manifesto finally came out in late February 1848.  It was a short, popular tract, written in German by Marx and Engels, intended to distinguish the Marxian socialism of the Communist League from other strands of socialism.  This is perhaps the best-known and most accessible of their works.  The Manifesto provides an outline of their theory, excising much of the heavy Hegelian baggage and placing a new emphasis on class conflict. They provide a thumbnail sketch of history as a struggle between oppressor and oppressed classes, and explain how socialism will emerge naturally from it.  They outline the purpose of the League, and review, and criticize, other types of socialism.  It ends with the famous and stirring threat:  ""Let the ruling classes tremble at the Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win"" (p.23) The Manifesto came out at the height of the people's revolution in Paris, which had broken out on February 22-24, 1848.  Although neither the Manifesto nor the Communist League had played a role in the Paris events, Marx was quick to congratulate the new revolutionaries.  Provisional government minister Ferdinand Flocon (editor of La Reforme, and Marx's friend from the Paris days) promptly revoked the old expulsion order and invited Marx to return to Paris.  Simultaneously, the Belgian government gave Marx twenty-four hours to leave, arrested him and marched him to the border.  But Marx hardly needed encouragement, as he had no intention of missing out on being at the epicenter of revolutionary events.  Marx arrived in Paris on March 5,  Engels arrived a couple of weeks later, and the Brussels central committee of the Communist League relocated their headquarters to Paris.  But they would not stay for long.   The revolutionary upheavals had spread east -- to Vienna, Budapest and Berlin by mid-March.  Marx and Engels scrambled to issue a manifesto calling for the establishment of a communist party inside Germany, and rushed east.  Marx and Engels arrived in Cologne in early April, 1848.  Marx would remain in Cologne for a year, and from there would witness the rise and fall of the springtime of the peoples.  Shortly after arriving in Cologne, Marx and Engels set about launching a daily newspaper, the Neue Rheinishe Zeitung (named after the one shut down in 1843), with Marx as editor-in-chief and Engels as assistant editor.  The NRZ was not, properly speaking, a communist newspaper, but rather set up as an organ of the democratic party in Germany (in which both Marx and Engels were active, and through which they first met and befriended the young Ferdinand Lassalle).  But when the first issue of Neue Rheinische Zeitung came out, on June 1, 1848, its liberal bourgeois backers balked at its strident tone.  Marx was supportive of the most radical democratic reforms of the German revolution, and the NRZ editorials reflected this.  However, he was not the most extreme. The Russian anarchist Michael Bakunin, an old friend from Paris, had also arrived in Germany at this time. Marx refused to support the wilder violent schemes favored by Bakunin - such as Herwegh's armed invasion of Baden or Bakunin's call for a Pan-Slavic uprising - and they had some acrimonious moments. Nonetheless, Marx was radical enough - the NRZ was the only German newspaper to unequivocally applaud the autonomous effort of the Parisian working classes to seize power during the June Days.   Marx urged the organization of German workers and visited revolutionary Berlin and Vienna that summer, trying to shore up fledgling workers' movements in those cities.   In September, 1848, parallel to the Frankfurt uprising, Marx, Engels and the NRZ tried to organize a communal revolution in Cologne in the heat of worker unrest, but the effort was defeated by late October.  Marx lingered on in Germany, watching morosely as the counter-revolution set in and the peoples' revolutions were suppressed across Europe.   By November, both Vienna and then Berlin were back under conservative control.  The NRZ called for civil disobedience to protest the Berlin coup, calling for a general boycott on taxes and other methods of peaceful protest.  Marx, along with other NRZ editors, were charged with libel, but acquitted at their trial in February.  In May, 1849, the NRZ vocally supported the violent insurgencies that broke out in pockets of Germany (including a Bakunin-organized uprising in Dresden) in a last-gasp effort to preserve popular gains.  But the revolution was clearly over.  The Prussian authorities ordered Marx expelled from Prussia on May 16, 1849 (he had renounced his Prussian citizenship back in 1845, and so was considered a foreign alien)   By contrast, legal proceedings were instituted against Engels, who had been actively involved in the May uprisings in the Rhineland (Engels made his way to revolutionary Baden, and eventually managed to slip over the border to Switzerland). The last issue of the NRZ, which came out on May 19, 1849, was printed in red ink. London Marx returned to Paris in late May, 1849, in time to witness the June rally of Ledru-Rollin and the French far-left in Paris, and the subsequent repressive crackdown on leftist organizations by the government of Louis Napoleon. On June 23, Marx was ordered to leave Paris within twenty-four hours.  He was given the option of going to Vannes, in Brittany, but Karl Marx decided to make his way to London instead.  He arrived in  London in late June, and his family followed in July.  Marx would live in London for the rest of his life. At this stage, Marx still hoped the situation in Germany could be retrieved, and that his stay in London might not be permanent.  The central committee of the Communist League had stayed behind in Cologne under the leadership of Friedrich Lessner (one of Marx's earliest disciples), and Marx imagined he might still be able run things from abroad.   At his urging, Engels left Switzerland and arrived in London in November. They promptly set up the NRZ Politisch-ökonomische Revue in London, recycling the title of their old paper as an irregular review, which they hoped to have printed and distributed into Germany from Hamburg.   But it would only run for a few issues in 1850 before hitting logistical difficulties. In its pages, Marx published his assessment of the lessons of the 1848 revolutions.  He applied his own theory to these political events - explaining the 1848 revolutions at least partly as a result of the financial panic and economic crisis of 1847, and the counter-revolutionary reaction also in economic terms.  Marx characterized the 1848 revolutions as a class conflict, rather than a political conflict, and its bloody denouement as evidence that modest democratic reforms were insufficient to address the plight of workers. But he went on to conclude that the conditions for a proletarian revolution were not yet ripe. The period between 1849 and 1852 were probably the darkest and most difficult days in Marx's life, not only for the repression of the revolutions and persecution of his comrades, but also for the precarious predicaments of his personal life.  Now thirty one years of age, Marx had arrived in London at the end of June 1849. In July, the Marx family - which now included three children (a fourth would be born shortly after their arrival) as well as Jenny's live-in companion Helene Demuth (""Lenchen"")  - were crowded into an apartment in the Chamberwell section of London.  They were soon also hosting a rotating coterie of German refugees and exiles.  Although Marx had always been poor, things were particularly straitened. Marx had sold his last remaining property in Trier and was unable to find employment in London. His contributions to the Chartist papers and lectures at the local German workers union were unpaid.  By the Spring of 1850, the money had run out and the Marxes were evicted.  In June 1850, the Marxes moved into a one-bedroom apartment on 28 Dean Street, in Soho (gmaps), the poorest part of the poorest neighborhood in London, which  would be their home for the next few years.  Engels was also unable to find paying work in London, and at length, in November 1850, Engels moved back to Manchester, accepting a position as a lowly clerk in his own father's company, and sent what little financial assistance he could to the Marxes.  That same November, 1850, their fourth child, Heinrich, died.  A fifth child, Franziska, was born in 1851, but died in the Spring of 1852. The Marxes' poverty reached such levels that the aristocratic Jenny had to beg a  neighbor for £2 to buy a coffin for her dead child. Some form of relief soon began to arrive.  In August 1851, Karl Marx had contributed some articles on the German revolution to Horace Greeley's New York Daily Tribune.  They proved a sensation, and the managing editor Charles A. Dana hired Marx by March 1852, to contribute a regular weekly column to the Tribune.  The sum - $5 or £1 per week (about $100 today) - was modest, but enough to stave off starvation, and when supplemented by Engels's generous subsidies (£5 a month after 1851), liberated Marx from the most pressing daily needs. Marx would continue contributing to the Tribune for the next eight years, until 1862 (although it is suspected Engels did most of the actual writing of Marx's earliest Tribune articles, given Marx's poor handle on the English language.).  At the height of these travails, from about July 1850, Marx delved into serious study of political economy.  Marx spent his days in the reading room at the British Museum, getting deep into economics and economic history, this time going beyond Smith and delving deeply into David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill  and other classical writers.   By January 1851, he was writing to Engels his first critiques of Ricardian rent theory.  In April, Marx estimated he would get done going through economics ""in five weeks"", by June that he was writing a work on economics that would take some ""six to seven weeks"".  By November, Marx spoke of looking for a German publisher for his forthcoming ""Economy"" book.  It was a bit optimistic. By mid-1852 this surge of energy had apparently worn itself out, and we hear little more about it.  Political events interrupted his research into economics. In 1852, Marx published his Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, condemning the French president's machinations to abolish the constitutional republic and transform France into an empire, elevating himself as Emperor Napoleon III.  Marx resignedly recognized that France still rested on the small farmer and peasant, and his inherent conservatism formed the backbone of support for Napoleon's coup and regime. (it is here where Marx wrote his famous observation: ""Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living"", p.9). Marx also revised his ideas on the future direction of the Communist League and other worker organizations.  The remaining central committee of the Communist League that had stayed back in Cologne were arrested by Prussian authorities and put on trial in October 1852.  The Cologne communists were sentenced to various prison terms.   From London, Marx published a scathing expose of the trial, but realized there was no point in continuing and the Communist League was dissolved in the aftermath.    Nonetheless, Marx refused to support the more radical plans being peddled by other German revolutionaries. Marx mocked the quixotic efforts of German radicals who made the rounds in the exile community, trying to re-ignite the revolution from abroad. Marx had little patience for their underground societies and hot-headed adventurist schemes.  For Marx, the workers' movement should be an open, mass movement, which requires patience and organization.  He deplored the murky conspiracies and plots for ""direct action"".  Marx and Engels' sarcastic Great Men in Exile (written 1852, but unpublished) was directed against them.. After 1852, Marx turned to focus more on his journalism for the Tribune.   In the run-up to the Crimean War in 1853, Marx came into the orbit of the shadowy orientalist David Urquhart, who managed to infect Marx with a rabid distaste for Tsarist Russia (already the arch-reactionary feudal imperialist state in Marx's mind, it did not take much).  Marx wrote several polemical articles for the Tribune denouncing Russian designs and almost accusing British minister Lord Palmerston of being a Russian stooge.  .In 1854, there was the Spanish revolution which focused his attentions.  He returned to economics briefly in early 1855, writing notes on money and commercial crises.  But then there was the Opium War of 1856 and the Indian Mutiny of 1857.  With his journalism pressing for research in other directions, it seemed that Marx might never end up getting around to his economics again.  Although there is no indication that he stopped his research into economics after 1852, there do not seem to be periods of sustained activity on it. In the meantime, his personal circumstances had changed again.  Marx's only son, the eight-year old Edgar died in 1856, leaving the surviving family with three daughters.  But things finally turned the corner later in 1856, when Jenny Marx came upon an inheritance from her mother in Trier, enabling the Marxes to move out of their crowded Soho apartment in early 1857 and take up residence in a comfortable suburban townhouse in Camden (north London. at 9 Grafton Terrace  (now 46; gmaps]).   Grundrisse Perhaps the new material comforts and less crowded atmosphere was the critical factor allowing him to return to economics.  By July 1857, Marx was revisiting the works of Bastiat and Carey..  But everything went into high gear in the late summer, when the Panic of 1857 and the accompanying worldwide economic slump hit the headlines.  For the next six months or so, in a gigantic burst of energy, Marx wrote a set of economics notes, known to posterity as the Grundrisse (Outlines).  In eight, densely-written notebooks, some 800 pages, Marx worked out the essentials of his new economic theory, containing the seeds of almost everything that would subsequently appear in the three volumes of Capital years later.  But this was also only an 'exercise' in self-enlightenment, rather than for publication.  In May 1858, Marx set the Grundrisse notebooks aside.  In the summer of 1858, Marx focused on actually writing a publishable draft.  He reworked his notes on money and capital in the form of an introduction to a forthcoming general work.  The introduction would come out as its own small book, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.  After some delays, it was published in early 1859.  The Grundrisse itself would never see the light of day.  Although some consider it a ""first draft"" of Capital, that is an overstatement as apparently no passages from the former were transferred to the latter.  Rather, like some earlier abandoned works, the Grundrisse was an exercise in self-clarification, to organize his own ideas for himself, rather than a proper composition.  Capital would be composed from scratch.  The Grundrisse would only appear in the mid-20th C. The Grundrisse marks an important transition in Marx's theory of history.  He jettisons the centrality of Smithian division of labor, which had measured the progress of forces of production in his earlier theories of  the1840s, and now identifies the development of private property as the critically progressing element. Previously, Marx had been stumped by the problem of explaining the apparently regressive transition from slave-based antiquity (high division of labor) to feudalism (with lower division of labor).  Marx resolved this in the Grundrisse by noting that feudalism was a step towards increasing private ownership relative to antiquity.  He also backs away from the Manifesto-style obsession with internal class conflict, recognizing the transitions and social revolutions can, and often are, brought about externally (e.g. Germanic conquest of the Roman empire).  Finally, he also abandoned the uniform linear stages history of modes of production (tribal,  slave, feudal, capitalist), recognizing he had generalized too quickly from the experience of the Mediterranean civilizations. He now identifies that other non-slave organizations of production (which he calls ""Asiatic"", ""Germanic"" and ""Slavic"" modes of production) could arise from the tribal phase, and insinuates that they need not continue necessarily into the feudal stage.  In short, in the Grundrisse, history is a little more open and a little less deterministic than in his previous writings. Marx interrupted his economics again and returned to European politics during the 1859 Franco-Sardinian war against Austria.  Although the cause of Lombard freedom from Austria had merit, Marx's deeply-held mistrust of Napoleon III led him to denounce the whole affair in the newspapers.  This brought Marx into conflict with other leftist radicals, notably Ferdinand Lassalle and Karl Vogt, who supported the Italian cause and the war against Austrian imperialism.  Marx's relations with Lassalle were strained, and Vogt wrote a pamphlet personally denouncing Marx.  Marx replied to the attack in his 1860 Herr Vogt basically accusing Vogt of being a paid Bonapartist agent.  Marx also sued the Berlin newspaper, National Zeitung, for libel, for reiterating some of Vogt's accusations.  The lawsuit went nowhere, and landed the Marxes only deeper in debt.  Compounding the trouble, Jenny fell ill with smallpox around the same time. The death of the Prussian king Frederick William IV in January 1861 and the ascension of the new king Wilhelm I of Prussia was accompanied by a general amnesty for former revolutionaries.  Marx toyed with the idea of returning to Germany, and joining Lassalle in launching a new newspaper in Berlin.  Marx undertook a visit to the continent in early 1861, calling on an uncle in Holland (who helped arrange a loan to tie the Marxes over) and his old mother in Trier.  But plans for a newspaper fell through - Marx and Lassalle failed to come to an agreement on sharing editorial responsibilities, but more importantly the amnesty did not restore Marx's lost Prussian citizenship and an application for re-naturalization submitted in late 1861 was rejected by the Prussian authorities.  Marx returned to London. With the outbreak of the American Civil War late that year,  the New York Tribune canceled Marx's regular column in 1862, placing Marx in a new financial predicament just as he was embarking on his grandest treatise yet. Marx had originally projected his 1859 Critique to be the first volume of a more general work on economics, but found that its rather abstract style had put off readers, and began reorganizing his general plan, for what would become Das Kapital. The entire first volume was essentially finished by the end of 1862 (at least according to his letters to the publishers).   But it would take another five years before it saw the light of day. The International In the meantime, Marx was busy.   The Universal Exhibition in London in 1862 had brought in streams of French and German artisans to visit the exhibition, and contact was opened between British, French and German labor leaders. The American civil war had drawn Marx's attentions, and in late 1862 he got involved in persuading British labor organizations to mount demonstrations in support of Lincoln and the unionist cause and to protest apparent plans by the British Liberal government to recognize the Southern Confederacy.  Marx subsequently fell ill through much of 1863, although by early 1864, his financial situation had much improved - he received a small inheritance from his mother (who had died in 1863) and Engels had ascended to partner in his father's Manchester factory, allowing him to expand Marx's allowance.  It is around this time that the Marxes moved once again, to 1 Modena Villas on Haverstock Hill in Hempstead Heath (now 1 Maitland Park Road, the original building was torn down c.1900 and replaced by ""the Grange""  gmap). . In 1863, Ferdinand Lassalle founded the first German labor party (ADAV), but it fell into internal dissension following Lassalle's premature death in a duel in early 1864.  At the time, Marx's attentions were focused on the Polish insurrection of 1863.  Following on the pattern of the Lincoln demonstrations, Marx urged the London Trades Council to organize a public protest in support of the Poles in April 1864.  A delegation of French union leaders was present, and the English council decided to draft an appeal to French laborers inviting them to form a sort of Anglo-French labor alliance.  The plan expanded over the summer, and invitations were sent out to representatives of other countries.  This culminated into a famous meeting at St. James Hall, London, in  November, 1864, where British and French labor leaders, as well as  representatives from a myriad of movements from other European countries, founded the International Workingman's Association (IWA), also known as the ""First International"".  The First International collected a whole array of socialist, communist, anarchist and trade union groups into the congress - English Chartists and Owenites, French followers of rivals Proudhon and Blanqui, German communists, wild anarchist followers of Bakunin,  Italian followers of Mazzini, Irish and Polish nationalists, etc.  The London delegates elected a provisional committee of twenty-one to organize the association.   Responsibility for writing its constitution and program was assigned to a subcommittee, which in turn left it to the forty-six year old Karl Marx to individually draft the provisional statutes.  A thirty-two person general council (which included more international figures) was elected on October 5 with directional and fund-raising responsibilities.  The immediate objectives of the International were to provide practical assistance to workers engaged in strikes, demonstrations and other struggles across different industries and countries, and to prevent the drafting of labor across-countries to break strikes.  Its long-term objectives are more open-ended, speaking vaguely of the ""complete emancipation of the working class"".  Marx's address - essentially a reiteration of the 1848 Manifesto - and his provisional statutes were adopted by the general council and published at the end of 1864. Through 1865, Marx's attentions were focused on the organizational meetings of the General Council of the IWA in London.   Unsurprisingly, quarrels were quick to develop - most notably between radical socialists like Blanqui (who argued for confrontational strikes) and anarchists like Proudhon (who argued for economic separatism, such as the establishment of worker cooperatives, outside of the capitalist system). Marx engaged in much correspondence to keep things together. English delegate Weston read a paper before the General Council of the IWA in 1865, using the wages fund doctrine to condemn trade union strikes as futile.  In reply, Marx hurriedly composed his own paper, Value, Prices and Profit, giving a synopsis of his own theory of wages and exploitation (intended to be put out as a IWA pamphlet, it was only published posthumously).  Throughout much of this time, Marx was bedridden for long periods with illness brought about by overwork.  Curiously, Marx also received overtures from the Prussian minister-president Otto von Bismarck.  The conservative minister-president had been quite personally fond of Ferdinand  Lassalle and was sympathetic to his State socialism program.  More shrewdly, Bismarck also hoped to use the working classes against his principal political opponents, the bourgeois liberals.  Since Lassalle's death, the ADAV had drifted under poor, squabbling leaders, and Bismarck may have believed Marx could breathe some life back into the movement (others suggest more cynically that Bismarck may have simply been trying to bribe Marx away from the revolutionary types of the IWA and tame him into a State socialist).  Whatever his motivations, aware of Marx's poverty, Bismarck tried to bring Marx to Berlin, offering him (through Lothar Bucher, in October 1865) a position as economic correspondent for the Staats Anzeiger, the Prussian government gazette.  Bismarck assured him he would have full editorial freedom, no restrictions on his content. Although tempted, Marx turned the offer down. Marx's statutes were only made permanent at the first annual congress of the IWA in Geneva in September 1866.   Three competing draft programs - Marx's, Mazzini's and Bakunin's - were submitted, but Marx's were finally adopted.  Marx did not attend the second annual meeting at Lausanne in 1867 - as he was then overseeing the publication of the first volume of Das Kapital.  Marx had declared it finished back in 1862, but it finally saw the light of day only now.  In March 1867, with his manuscript under his arm, Marx headed to Hamburg to deliver it in person to the publisher Otto Meissner, and was receiving proof sheets by June.  The first copies of the printed volume reached London in September, 1867. Capital The first volume of Das Kapital (1867) was Karl Marx's magnum opus.  It begins with a long, intricate and somewhat abstruse discussion of commodity production (Pt.1), which includes a discussion of money carried over from his 1859 Critique.  Only thereafter does he finally proceed to the principal theoretical contribution in this treatise: the theory of surplus value and labor exploitation. Marx essentially defines capitalism as a system (""mode of production"") designed for capital accumulation rather than consumption.  In more primitive systems,  farmers and artisans produced commodities with the object of exchanging them for money in order to buy other commodities that better fit their consumption needs (C-M-C).  In capitalism, by contrast, production of commodities for exchange are merely an intermediary step in a process initiated by capitalists in order to make more money, what he calls the ""circuit of capital"" (M-C-M'),   That is, capitalists use money (M) to buy labor power and raw materials, which are then transformed by production into commodities (C) which are then sold for a greater amount of money (M').  Critical to this story is the role of machinery and technological change. .The transition from C-M-C to M-C-M' was brought about by the competitive nature of capitalism.  The drive for profits emerged out of necessity - capitalists had an urgent need accumulate money in order to reinvest in the latest technology or risk being undercut and wiped out by other capitalists.  It was cut-throat competition, not mere greed, that forced capitalists to strive towards profits, and turned production towards the generation of profit, rather than the satisfaction of needs. But of course, it was a short-term gain - for although a new piece of cost-reducing technology may yield extraordinary profits for a particular capitalist, it is only temporary, as other capitalists will adopt it too, and the profit rate will be driven back down. While the dynamism of capitalism is the central story of Capital, it is all built on the exploitation of workers.  And it is this part of the story that is most associated with Marx's thought. While M-C-M' may seem straightforward, Marx identifies a puzzle: how is this increase in value, from M to M', achieved?  Having embraced  Ricardo's labor theory of value most insistently - that is, that labor-embodied is the only source of value - then the exchange process cannot increase value.  Instead, Marx turns to examining the production process, and identifies ""labor power"" (as distinct from labor) as the only input which has the capacity to create greater value than it costs the capitalist to hire.  It is this difference that the creates surplus and thus profits. The critical part of the labor exploitation story is that workers are paid full competitive wages, but that labor works more hours than what is needed to cover the wage bill.  Using the example of a working day, suppose a laborer works ten hours, but that the daily wage can be covered by four hours of labor, then the remaining six hours are ""surplus"" labor time that accrues to the capitalist.  Or to use Marx's term, the ""rate of exploitation"" = 6/4 = 1.5.  Now the capitalist can increase the rate of exploitation by increasing either the absolute surplus value (Pt.3) or the relative surplus value (Pt.4).   An example of the former is if the working day is increased from 10 to 11 hours, so the rate of exploitation increases accordingly to 7/4 = 1.75.  But technological innovation, the introduction of machinery (""constant capital"") can increase relative surplus value by reducing the the necessary labor time to produce daily wage. e.g. if the length of the working day is left unchanged at 10 hours, but technological improvements allows more to be done per hour, so that the wage bill is covered in 3 hours rather than 4, then the rate of exploitation increases to 7/3 =  2.33.  That is, relative surplus value increases    While increasing absolute surplus value was critical in the early stages of capitalism - with accompanying workplace struggles over the lengthening of the working day - it was relative surplus value that became the more important factor in the latter stages.  His subtle discussion of the wage (Pt.6) goes well beyond the Malthusian/Ricardian iron law of wages to allow competitive wages and absolute standards of living to rise over time - so long as labor productivity is increasing faster than the wage, the rate of exploitation will be increasing.   Although Marx's analysis taken together - technological innovation and rising wages - insinuates that workers may indeed be improving their living conditions as a result of capitalist exploitation, he believes workers find (or should find) rising relative surplus value and growing inequality to be a scandal.   A more subtle point is what happens to profit over time.  This is elaborated more in volume II, with the scheme of expanded reproduction.  While the Ricardian theory assume a diminishing rate of profit over time brought about by limitation of land, Marx rejects this limitation, believing capitalism can overcome such natural barriers.  But Marx posits a diminishing rate of profit over time because of the increased investment into machinery and raw materials per worker.  The rate of profit, by definition, is the surplus per capital invested. Even if the capitalist can extract a greater surplus value per worker, his overall profit rate might still decline because it requires ever-greater investment of capital.  Marx believes that overall, as capitalist advances, this tends to be the case, forcing the capitalist to look for innovative ways to boost the profit rate without simply increasing capital per worker.  This may have to be accomplished by mergers (thus leading to increased industrial concentration).  An alternative is to lean on the labor force, forcing wages down.  This is harder to accomplish in a competitive environment with tight labor markets, but Marx points out that there is a ""reserve army of labor"" that often softens labor markets.  This includes not only the legions of urban unemployed displaced by mechanization, but more critically the rural poor, living on the margin between agrarian and industrial society, who can migrate into and out of employment on a dime.   Marx ends volume I of Capital rather anomalously with a discussion of ""primitive accumulation"" (Pt.7) This perhaps should have been included earlier (and is often read earlier).  It discusses the critical role of private property in the transition to capitalism.  Means of production existed in pre-capitalist times, but they were not necessarily transferable private property, that could be converted into capital.  Marx identifies the critical historical role of political and military events in expanding the legal concept of private property, and the seizure of legal control and direction of productive activity by an emergent capitalist class. After the publication of volume I, Marx promptly began working on the second volume, and did much work in the course of 1868-69, but effort thereafter was sporadic.  Marx would not see the publication of the second and third volumes of Capital during his lifetime.   Nonetheless, Marx oversaw revisions in the first volume for a second German edition in 1872.  It was translated into Russian and French in 1872.  Nonetheless, by and large, Capital volume I failed to make an impact. Few bothered to read the hefty tome.  It passed largely unnoticed in the western press.  Even in socialist circles it was largely overlooked, only in Russia did it seemed to draw serious attention.  Party politics For the next few years, Marx's time was largely focused on political activities related to the International.  With Marx absent, the IWA congress in Lausanne in September 1867 ended up being dominated by French followers of Proudhon, who passed a series of resolutions focusing on cooperatives and worker credit. Nonetheless, Marx was ably represented by Kugelman, Eccarius and Lessner, and resolutions were passed making the connection between workers' rights and political revolution.  Many IWA delegates also ended up attending the neighboring Geneva Peace League organized by bourgeois liberals like J.S. Mill, and featured the presence of Italian nationalist Giuseppe Garibaldi and Marx's old rival, the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. Marx denounced it as a sideshow and reiterated the importance of staying aloof from established political parties.  At the next congress, in Brussels in1868, the IWA formally disassociated itself from the Geneva Peace League, although it did not forbid informal alliances with anti-militarist groups.  But at the parallel conference of the Peace League at Bern in 1868, Bakunin and his followers resigned in a huff and formed their own organization (Alliance de la démocratie socialiste) based in Geneva, and applied to the IWA for affiliate status.  At Marx's urging, the proposal was turned down by the IWA's general council in London, feeling that the ADS's program conflicted with that of the IWA, and the scope of an ""organization within an organization"" would merely cause trouble.  The Basel IWA Congress of 1869 seemed to cement the victory of Marx over Proudhon.   The Marxians successfully persuaded the congress that Proudhonian approach reduced the worker's struggle to a mere matter of ""wages and hours"" rather than actual emancipation. But the Basel congress also happened to be attended by Mikhail Bakunin himself as a delegate.  Marx suspected that Bakunin was calculating to take over the IWA organization for himself, and feared he might use to occasion to make wild demands and embarrass Marx and the GC leadership before the other delegates.  Anticipating Bakunin, Marx submitted a proposal on the abolition of the law of inheritance, a pet cause of Bakunin, worded in a  way that Bakunin would have no choice but to support it.  Nonetheless, Bakunin still criticized Marx for exaggerating workers' revolutionary potential, criticized  the Marxian political approach and instead urged the IWA to promote separation from the State, rather than taking it over.  That very same year, the Marxists launched their political involvement inside Germany.  In Marx's eyes, the Lassallian labor party (ADAV) had been too fractious and ineffective, with a bizarre and often hostile relationship to fledgling German trade unions, and the dissatisfaction with the party leadership was evident in the German delegates to the IWA.  Under Marx's influence, at a congress in Eisenach in 1869, August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht launched their own separate labor party in Germany, the Social Democratic Workers' Party (Socialdmokratische Arbeiterpartei, SDAP) on Marxian lines, and launched their party paper, Der Vokstaat.  The Marxian SDAP and the Lassallian ADAV would compete with each other for the next few years. There was no IWA congresses in either 1870 or 1871 - it was interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War.  Marx - with his fervent detestation of Napoleon III, latent German patriotism and fear of offending workers on either side - did not outrightly condemn the war and the IWA's General Council issued only a tepid statement.  The SDAP was spit over the issue - Bebel and Liebknicht condemned the war, but another group, the ""Brunswick Committee"", urged German workers to help the war effort so long as it was defensive (a position largely approved by Marx).  But once the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine was made an objective, Marx (and the GC) changed positions and condemned the war of conquest   Marx and the IWA threw their support wholeheartedly behind the Paris Commune formed in the aftermath of the war on March 18, 1871.  It was not a socialist creation - the Paris Commune was originally formed in alliance with bourgeois republicans and nationalists to resist what they perceived as attempts by a reactionary assembly at Versailles to reimpose a monarchy in France.  But in the course of the siege of Paris, as the bourgeoisie faltered, the socialists grew in influence.  The Paris Commune was crushed in May, in an orgy of bloodshed.  The subsequent crackdown and mass executions were traumatic for the workers' movement.  Perceived as the organizing force behind the commune, the IWA was blamed for revolutionary excesses and condemned by the press and politicians, and branches were suppressed in various European countries.  The British trade unions had also withdrawn from the IWA around this time - realizing that any connection to the IWA or Marx worked against their efforts to get parliament to repeal the remaining restrictions of the Combination laws.  Besides these external events greatly weakening the International, the Bakuninite takeover bid remained a threat and new internal conflicts had also arisen. Engels had retired from Manchester and moved to London in 1870, and thereafter, Marx and Engels were inseparable.  Other socialist leaders, even inside the GC, like Eccarius and Jung, grew embittered as they felt their counsel was being ignored by Marx, who seemed to now only consult Engels.  Although he was still struggling with finishing volume II of Capital, the organizational matters of the International took much of his time and mind. At the meeting of the general council in London in September 1871 (sometimes characterized as a congress), Marx introduced revisions to the IWA statutes, notably resolution No.9. which explicitly set up the goal of transforming the workers' movement into a political party. It was gauntlet thrown down against the anarchists. Marx's GC proposals were considered next year at the congress of the IWA in the Hague in September 1872 (which both Marx and Engels attended, and made sure as many of their followers were there as possible).   Marx's proposals faced vociferous opposition from the anarchists (who dominated the Spanish, Italian and Swiss delegations).  Marx emphasized the lesson of the Commune was the urgent need to seize political power. But anarchist leaders Mikhail Bakunin and James Guillaume say the real lesson was to reject politics and the state, to pursue separatism, and forge alliances between workers and peasants.  They accused Marx of a penchant for authoritarian statism, and reminded the congress that Marx and Engels were not workers themselves, but ""bourgeois intellectuals"" out of touch with worker needs or desires.  After five days of bitter fighting, the IWA's General Council voted to expel Bakunin and his followers..  Bakunin and the anarchist delegates decamped to form their own ""Anti-Despotic"" congress at St. Imier.  The socialist-anarchist split was now permanent.   Although the Marxists seemed to have ""won"" the Hague congress and prevented the Bakuninites from taking it over, it was a pyrrhic victory and the IWA was on the road to termination.    At the Hague, the GC had voted to transfer the GC headquarters to New York, in the hands of trusted German socialists, effectively abandoning Europe.  The Marxists realized that if it remained in Europe, the Bakuninite anarchists would continue to trying to to take it over and continue using its congresses to stage propaganda meetings against it . Several old branches (e.g. Belgian, Spanish) repudiated the Hague resolutions and transferred allegiance to the Bakunin's organization.  The British federation also condemned the move to New York and English activist John Hales tried to raise a campaign to depose Marx from his leadership position (Marx and Engels replied with letters to the International Herald). Although an IWA congress was still held at Geneva in 1874, it was attended by only a paucity of Marxists.   The last congress of the IWA was held at Philadelphia in 1876, where the First International was formally dissolved.   Through these stressful struggles, Marx's health declined precariously.  With his finances more straitened and his daughters grown and married off, the Marxes moved one last final time in 1875 - this time to smaller, humbler place down the road at 41 Maitland Park in Hempstead (building destroyed in WWII, plaque at current Maitland flats gmap).    The dissolution of the IWA was a blow to Marx's original aspirations.  But by now Marx realized that there was more to be gained by supporting the establishment and growth of separate workers' organizations and political parties at the national level, than insisting on unity in a precariously vulnerable international organization.  Marx took some comfort in the rapid electoral gains the socialists seemed to continue to be making in Germany during - especially in the 1874 Reichstag elections. On a trip to Carlsbad for a medical cure in the summer of 1874, Karl Marx took a side-trip to Leipzig to consult with Liebknecht in person about negotiations for a merger of the two rival socialist parties - the Lassallian ADAV and the Marxian SDAP - at an upcoming joint congress in Gotha, Thuringia.  However, in the prelude, the proposed united party program forwarded by Liebknecht to Marx took more elements from Lassalle's rather than the Marx's handbook.  In advance of the congress, Marx wrote his Critique of the Gotha Program (1875) as a missive to the SDAP leadership.  Besides condemning the unity program, it is here that Marx first carefully outlined his ideas of revolutionary socialism, including the concept of a ""dictatorship of the proletarian"". He criticized the Lasallian formula of ""To each according to his contribution"" , which tied wages to productive contributions, as only the first stage of socialism, and promoted in its stead the old slogan  ""From each according to his ability, to each according to what he needs"" (originally forged by Louis Blanc)  as the higher state of communism.  Marx's critique was not published - Liebknecht realized it would imperil the merger, and respectfully advised Marx that his advice could not be followed in this instance.  At the Gotha congress in May 1875, the socialist parties were merged to form a single united socialist party, the Social Democratic Party (initially called  Sozialistiche Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands, SAPD), and adopted the Lassallian-heavy program.  Marx was infuriated.   The rapid rise of socialists in local elections had alarmed Bismarckian government.  Or perhaps more precisely, it alarmed the German bourgeois liberal parties.  Presenting himself as the savior of Germany from the ""red menace"", Bismarck exploited a couple of dubious failed assassination attempts on the Kaiser to ban the Social Democratic Party in 1878.  But at the same time, Bismarck re-oriented German economic policy towards the more protectionist and State socialist direction he preferred himself with a series of reforms introducing the welfare state in Germany.  . With efforts in Germany stalled, Marx turned to France.   Battered and driven underground in the aftermath of the commune, French workers' organizations only began to be rebuilt slowly. With the counter-reaction relaxing, various disconnected syndicates, cooperatives, student groups, were brought together by former communard Jules Guesde under the umbrella of the French Socialist Workers' Federation (Fédération des travailleurs socialistes de France, FTSF) in 1878.  Up until now, Marxism was still largely unknown in French socialist circles (Proudhon, Blanqui, etc. were bigger names and influences), but Guesde came into contact with Paul Lafargue (Marx's son-in-law), who introduced him to Marx.   At a conference in Le Havre 1880, Jules Guesde founded the French Workers' Party (Parti Ouvrier, POF) as the political wing of the FTSF, the first French socialist party to compete independently in elections.  The POF's party program was largely dictated by Marx himself.  This was protested by the revolutionary syndicalist Blanquists, under Édouard Vaillant, who split to form their own organization, the Comité révolutionnaire central (CRC). The dismal showing of the POF in the 1881 French general elections brought further splits.  At the FTSF Congress at Saint-Etienne, there was a floor revolt against the Guesde-Marx program, claiming it had cost workers electoral seats and postponed the badly-needed reforms they wanted.  The Proudhonists, still nursing wounds from the First International, secured a resolution condemning the ""Marxist dominance"" of the party - prompting  Guesde and Lafargue to decamp in a huff, splitting the Marxist POF off from the FTSF. The Proudhonist FTSF, under the leadership of Paul Brousse and Benoît Malon, would go on to become its own, gradualist, socialist party.   The Proudhonists had exploited latent jacobin suspicions among French workers about the foreign program of the  ""Prussian Marx"" (it didn't help that Lafargue was German-born).  But in retrospect, Marx had overestimated the appeal of Marxism to French workers.  The bulk of French industry was largely still organized around small-scale production with highly-skilled workers, with a preference for decentralized organizations.  The centralized POF found some appeal in major industrial centers in the north, but not really beyond that. Death Although still acting as advisor to the various socialist parties, declining health and personal tragedies marked Marx's own last few years.  His wife, Jenny Marx, fell grievously ill with cancer in the Summer of 1880, and after a long struggle, finally died in December 1881.  During this period, as her condition worsened, Marx realized he would not long survive himself and with one last bout of effort in the summer of 1881, tried to finish the remaining volumes of Capital, but to no avail.  Ill and overworked, Marx was broken by Jenny's death, and only at the urging of his doctor and friends consented to abandon the miserable home in London and go abroad. In early 1882, Marx visited his daughters in Paris and went on to try a cure in southern France and even Algiers, but it did little good. He returned to England, spending the remainder of 1882 on the Isle of Wight.  In January, Marx returned to London.  Karl Marx died on March 14, 1883.  Posthumous publications Marx's legacy at the time of his death was uncertain.  Although he had achieved a degree of fame in his lifetime, he risked fading into the background after his death.  As a revolutionary activist, Marx's aspirations had fallen short: the First International had been a fiasco and was buried, the German socialists had gone in a different direction (and were banned altogether away), while Marxists elsewhere were drummed out of the main workers' movements. His intellectual impact was no more certain.  With the exception of the 1848 Communist Manifesto, most of Marx's published works had gone largely unread or were out of print and forgotten by 1883. It was left to Friedrich Engels to clear up the mess of manuscripts, popularize Marx's works and reignite the socialist movement. Engels's saw Marx's Capital as his major work, and felt it needed more attention that it had hitherto received. Engels's primary task was to complete the remaining volumes of Capital which Marx had been working on sporadically in the last dozen years of his life.  But even the first volume was having a hard time. It had been largely overlooked upon its first appearance in 1867. Most only became aware of its content via the synopsis of it given fourteen years later in Engels's popular Anti-Dühring (1878). An English translation would only appear in 1887, well after Marx's death.  Engels put out a fourth (German) edition of volume I in 1890, in an effort to keep it print.  But even so, few read it directly, most relying on popular synopses given elsewhere - besides Engels (1878), there was the notable French synopsis of Deville (1883), German of Kautsky (1887) and English of Aveling (1892). Already in the immediate aftermath of Marx's death, Capital was threatened with usurpation.  In early 1884, another book also called Das Kapital by the late German historicist Karl Rodbertus was published.  It contained (in its introduction) the bald charge that Marx's theory of surplus value had been plundered wholesale from an 1842 treatise by Rodbertus.  It was not the first time the charge had been raised, but it provoked Engels and Kautsky to reply in the pages of Die Neue Zeit.  C.A. Schramm rose to the defense of Rodbertus, and the battle continued over the next year.  Engels would spend a good part of his preface to a new 1884 edition of Poverty of Philosophy, as well as his preface to Vol. II of Capital, undermining Rodbertus's claim.   Under Engels's editorship, the second volume of Capital appeared in early 1885 (with the particular title ""The Process of Circulation of Capital"").  Less grand in its vision, volume II contains little history but a lot of economics.  It contains Marx's intricate multi-sectoral scheme of simple reproduction and a (somewhat incomplete) scheme of expanded reproduction.  It also delivers Marx's more detailed critique of Say's Law and a theory of crisis.   Curiously, one of the side-effects of the Rodbertus debate was the so-called ""transformation problem."".  This was essentially the same problem that bedeviled Ricardo and was noted by Marx in volume I - namely, that if competition equalizes wages and length of working day across sectors, so that surplus value is equalized.  But if so, then industries with different degrees of capital intensity (""organic composition"") will not have the same profit rate - contradicting the basic Smithian conception of competition in product markets.  If equalization of profit is forced by assumption, then prices will diverge from embodied labor value, thus invalidating the labor theory of value.  In the preface to volume II, Engels announced that Marx had already ""resolved"" the transformation problem in the notes to volume III, and challenged followers of Rodbertus (or anyone else who doubted Marx's ability) to posit their own solutions quickly before volume III came out.  Among those who submitted attempted solutions to Engels were Wilhelm Lexis, Conrad Schmidt, Julius Wolf and Achille Loria. As it turns out, Volume III was not ""about to come out"". Engels had put out volume II in one year.  But the manuscripts of volume III were in a worse shape, and would take a decade to sort through.  After hitting a wall in 1887, Engels set the manuscripts aside to focus on other projects.  Besides his own works, Engels put out a new (fourth) edition of volume I in 1890 and reprinted some of Marx's lesser works.  Volume III was finally published in 1894 (with particular title ""the Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole"").  With attention pricked up by the transformation problem, it drew attention from economists to see Marx's own solution.  The German historicist Werner Sombart reviewed it relatively generously, Wilhelm Lexis more critically, but the Austrian economist Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk tore it to shreds. More useful were the Russian contributions, in particular the mathematical solutions offered by the unknown Vladimir Dmitriev (1898) followed up by the academic Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz (1907). Nonetheless, Marxian economics has remained divided on whether Marx actually solved the problem, or even in interpreting what Marx's solution was exactly. Marx's other works only began to appear slowly.  The ban on German socialists was lifted in 1890.  In prelude to the new party congress, Wilhelm Liebknecht finally revealed and published Marx's 1875 Critique of the Gotha Program.  At the party congress in Erfurt in October 1891, the Lassallian Gotha program was ejected and a new program - the ""Erfurt Program"", on Marxian lines - was adopted by the renamed Social Democratic Party (Sozialdemokratischen Partei Deutschlands, SPD). Among Marx's notes, Engels ignored the Grundrisse, the outlines Marx had written in the splurge of energy back in 1857-68.  Engels had not used these notes in his own posthumous editing of the second and third volumes of Capital.  Indeed, the existence of the Grundrisse was unknown for decades.  The first indication was a 1902 article in Karl Kautsky's Die Neue Zeit, which extracted the introduction from its morass of notes, and assumed it was to have been intended as the introduction to his 1859 Zur Kritik work.   The rest of the Grundrisse was only discovered in 1923 by David Ryazanov in Moscow, and began to published in parts in 1939.  An excerpt on pre-capitalist formations was published as a separate tract in 1952.   The full edition of the Grundrisse had to wait until 1953. In a rare moment of collaboration, Engels handed a different set of Marx's notes on the history of economic thought, written around 1861-63, over to Karl Kautsky to edit and prepare for publication.  But Kautsky was even slower than Engels, and the notes, which would bear the title the Theories of Surplus Value were only finally published in 1905-10.

Andreu Mas-Colell, 1944-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/mascolell.htm," Andreu Mas-Colell is one of the leading Neo-Walrasian theorists of the modern day. His work - often characterized as a powerful testament to the value of worked examples and counter-examples - has led to a collection of remarkable insights and the opening of new avenues for General Equilibrium Theory. The story begins in 1974, when Andreu Mas-Colell proved the existence of a competitive equilibrium after dropping the famous axioms of completeness and transitivity of consumer preferences. He liked this so much that he and David Gale did it again in 1975.  Mas-Colell has since directed his efforts into several particularly important areas: in the exploitation of differentiable calculus to analyze G.E.T. (e.g. 1977, 1985), the use of cross-dual dynamics to examine stability of equilibrium (1986), the examination of market demand and aggregation (1976, 1977, 1987) and the theory of differentiated commodities (1975). Perhaps most famously, Mas-Colell has explored the conditions necessary for the existence of an equilibrium in a wide variety of infinite-dimensional contexts - whether for Walrasian competitive equilibria (1986, 1991), Nash equilibria (1984) or Radner equilibria (1996). Indeed, his 1986 proof of existence of a Walrasian equilibrium in a rather generic infinite-dimensional economy has been hailed as definitive (although his introduction of ""uniform properness"" has been an issue of concern ever since).  Mas-Colell is also renowned for his work on relating game theory to Walrasian G.E. - notably, in the relationship of the bargaining set with competitive equilibrium (1989) and exploring the relationship between Walrasian and Nash equilibria (1981, 1983).  Mas-Colell is also one of the co-authors of  what is easily the definitive modern graduate textbook on microeconomic theory (1995). Mas-Colell was born in Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain.  As an undergraduate, he was expelled from the University of Barcelona in the 1960s for democratic activism, finally obtaining his undergraduate degree in 1966 at the University of Valladolid.  In 1968, he went to the United States, getting a Ph.D in economic from the University of Minnesota in 1972.  He went immediately to the University of California, Berkeley (obtaining a joint appointment with the mathematics department in 1975).  He was lured by Harvard in 1981.   He returned to Spain in 1995, becoming a professor at the University Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona.  He has also since gotten involved in politics, entering the Catalonian Parliament under the parliamentary group Convergència i Unió and is serving as its Commissioner on Universities and Research      Major Works of Andreu Mas-Colell     Resources on Andreu Mas-Colell   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Pierre Louis de Maupertuis, 1698-1759,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/maupertuis.htm," The ""French Newton"", Maupertuis was one of France's foremost astronomers, physicists, geographers, biologists and mathematicians of the Enlightenment period.   Originally a soldier, Maupertuis became acquainted with the work of Sir Isaac Newton during a journey to England in 1728.  It was Maupertuis who was responsible for bringing Newton's work to a wider audience on the Continent  (esp. with his 1732 work) and thereby making him the poster boy of the Enlightenment spirit.  He was the tutor of Madame du Châtelet (the translator of Newton's Principia and Voltaire's mistress).  In 1736-7, Maupertuis led a famous expedition to Lapland to measure the degree of the meridien and thereby proving the Newtonian conjecture about the flattening of the globe at the poles.   In 1745, he was invited by Frederick of Prussia to head the royal academy of sciences in Berlin.  His activities there attracted numerous scholars and scientists, making Berlin one of the poles of the Enlightenment age.  In 1744, Maupertuis provided a new formulation of Fermat's ""principle of least action"", which was later taken up by Euler, Lagrange and Hamilton (it also led to a protracted controversy with Samuel König).   Maupertuis's 1745 work promulgates an early version of the theory of evolution and his 1751 work on hereditary traits presages the modern notion of dominant and recessive genes.  Jealous of his prominence in Prussian society, Voltaire's acerbic wit (esp. Diatribe du Docteur Akakia and Micromégas) made life in Berlin quite uncomfortable for Maupertuis .  Maupertuis's 1768 works on linguistics were critically reviewed by Jacques Turgot. Maupertuis's presence on this website is mainly due to his philosophy of ""negative hedonism"" (1749).  Like Locke and Maupertuis conceived of the pleasure/pain calculus in an asymmetric manner: pleasure was merely ""tranquility"", while pain -- or more precisely, ""uneasiness"" -- is the generator of action (to remove pain, etc.).  Thus, in Maupertuis's conception, human behavior is not characterized as the pursuit of pleasure, but merely pain-avoidance.  A deep pessimism about the possibility of achieving happiness, Maupertuis recommends a Stoical rather than an Epicurean outlook to life, as the former will minimize uneasiness, whereas the desire for happiness will just create more uneasiness.  Maupertuis's negative hedonism was taken up by the Italian utilitarians, such as Genovesi, Ortes, Verri and Beccaria.

Jakob Mauvillon, 1743-1794,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/mauvillon.htm," German military engineer, historian and Physiocrat. Born in Leipzig, Jakob Eléazar Mauvillon descende from a family of French Huguenot refugees in Saxony.  Bent on a military career, Jakob Mauvillon attempted to enlist in the Hanoverian army, but was consistently rejected on account of his diminutive height and frail constitution.  Persisting, he was at length admitted into the corps of engineers.   He went on to secure an appointment teaching engineering and military science, first in the military collegium of Cassel at 1771, achieving the rank of captain in the corps in 1777.  He subsequently moved to the Collegium Carolinium in Brunswick in 1784, eventually reaching the rank of lieutenant-colonel.   Mauvillon's interest in economics emerged via his translations of French texts, notably Abbé Raynal's Histoire des deux Indes in 1774 and then Jacques Turgot's Reflexions in 1775.  Converted to Physiocracy, Mauvillon went on to produce his own summary of the doctrine in an essay in his Sammlung von Aufsätzen (1776, a collection of translated economic essays, e.g.  Tucker).  Mauvillon's essay contains the probably the first use of the term 'Physiocrat' to refer to a follower of Quesnay's doctrines (the word physiocratie had been, of course, used earlier as a title by Dupont de Nemours, not the identifiers 'physiocrat' or 'physiocratic' for the sect). Mauvillon's essay provoked a response by his Cassel colleague C.W. Dohm, a cameralist and vigorous opponent of the new doctrine, which opened up a wider debate on Physiocracy in German circles.  Mauvillon composed a rejoinder to Dohm in his Physiocratische Briefe (1780) containing one of the better German restatements of the theory. Other participants in the Mauvillon debate include Fürstenau (1778), Springer (1780) in defense of physiocracy, with Pfeiffer (1780) against it, and Georg Andreas Will taking an intermediary position. In 1788, Mauvillon ghost-authored the bulk of De la monarchie Prussiene, normally attributed to the younger Comte de Mirabeau (son of the Physiocrat), with whom Mauvillon had struck up a friendship.

Hans Mayer, 1879-1955.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/mayer.htm,"Austrian economist, student of Friedrich von Wieser and professor at the University of Vienna.  Hans Mayer studied law at the University of Vienna, receiving doctorate in 1907.  After a period of interlude in the private sector and as a lecturer at Friburg (Switzerland), he obtained his habilitation at Vienna in 1914.  He was set to teach in Prague, but WWI broke out, and Mayer served on the front and eventually in the War Ministry.  Mayer returned to Prague in 1919, and in 1921 moved on Graz, succeeding Joseph Schumpeter. Friedrich von Wieser handpicked Hans Mayer to succeed to his chair at the University of Vienna in 1923.  Hans Mayer helped educate and mentor much of the Third Generation of Austrian School - which included Hayek, Haberler, Rosenstein-Rodan and Morgenstern. Mayer's tenure at Vienna has been regarded as controversial. For starters, Mayer reportedly spent much of his time sparring with his colleagues at Vienna.  These included junior colleague Ludwig von Mises (representing the Böhm-Bawerk's branch of the Austrian School, in contrast to Mayer's Wieserian tradition), the Austro-Marxist Carl Grünberg (who taught economic history) and above everything, the Historicist-trained economic ""universalist"" Othmar Spann (who taught economics and sociology).  The titanic battle between Mayer and Spann for the ""soul"" of economics at Vienna divided the university in the 1920s and veered into personal acrimony. In the streit between Mayer and Spann in the 1920s, Mayer deployed institutional resources in the service of the Austrian School.  The venerable old Austrian journal, Zeitschrift für Volkswirtschaft, Sozialpolitik und Verwaltung, founded back in 1892, had been only sporadically published since the end of the war, and attempts to re-launch it were marred by Spann's control.  Mayer effectively side-stepped it and launched the new Austrian journal, the Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie in 1929, placing it in the hands of Rosenstein-Rodan  and Morgenstern.  Mayer also founded the Austrian economics society (Nationalökonomische Gesellschaft, NÖG) in 1927.  Despite his early promise, Mayer himself published comparatively little.  Mayer is best known for intra-mural activities to maintain the Austrian School tradition at Vienna against Spann's aspirations and  for shepherding the department during the difficult years after the rise of the Austro-fascism in 1934.  But Mayer's notoriety rests on being the only member of the Austrian School that remained in Vienna after the Anschluss of 1938, and for accommodating himself with the Nazi authorities, including implementing their requests a little too eagerly (e.g. Mayer ordered the expulsion of all Jewish members of the NÖG within the first week).  No less sinisterly, although Spann and his cohort had been the first to be purged from Vienna, Mayer urged the Nazi authorities the proscribe Spann's publications, on the grounds that is was insufficiently anti-Semitic.  The ever-adaptable Mayer stayed on after the war, both at Vienna and at the head of  NÖG and the ZfN, until his retirement in 1950.

John Ramsay McCulloch, 1789-1864.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/mcculloch.htm," A prolific Scottish journalist, John Ramsay McCulloch was one of the most ardent and doctrinaire expositors of  the Classical Ricardian School.  John Ramsay McCulloch began his career as the editor of the Whig magazine The Scotsman, eventually moving on to the quarterly The Edinburgh Review, where he served as economics editor until the late 1830s. McCulloch used his position at the ER to popularize the Classical theory and promote his favorite economic policies, such as the repeal of the Corn Laws, Poor Law reform and repeal of the Combination Acts.  After David Ricardo's death in 1823, the Political Economy Club raised a subscription for a series of public lectures on economics in his memory to be delivered in London by John Ramsay McCulloch.  While the preparation of the lectures was going on, the same coterie of figures had gone on to found a university in London - what would become University College London.  It was consequently decided to institutionalize McCulloch's lectures into a permanent ""Ricardo chair"" at UCL.  As a result, McCulloch was appointed the first Ricardo professor of political economy at UCL in 1828.  McCulloch held that position until 1837.  He resigned in 1838 to take up an appointed the Comptroller of HM Stationary Office. McCulloch's main work, Principles (1825), was perhaps the first successful ""serious"" textbook in economics (and a rather loyal reading of Ricardo's theory).  However, critics often dismiss McCulloch as a ""lightweight"" in terms of the development of economic theory.  Arguably his main contribution was the ill-fated ""wages fund"" doctrine (1824, 1825, 1826).    McCulloch was also the editor of the 1828 edition of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations and the 1846 edition of David Ricardo's Works. He also composed some of the earliest accounts of the history of economic thought (naturally, flattering to the Ricardians). Despite his predilection and proclamations in favor of theory, McCulloch was also a monumental compiler of empirical facts (e.g. 1832, 1837).  His 1837 treatise, in particular, provides a statistical account of the failure of the Malthusian population doctrine.

Rev. John McVickar, 1787-1868,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/mcvickar.htm,"  Conservative American Episcopalian clergyman from New York, the first professor of political economy at Columbia, one of the first in the United States.  John McVickar was an Episcopalian minister, and an alumnus of Columbia.  Politically a Federalist, and a disciple of Hamilton, McVickar was nonetheless a convert to the economics of Ricardo and the ""British"" school of free trade.   John McVickar was appointed in 1817 as professor of moral philosophy, rhetoric and belles lettres at Columbia College .  He took responsibility for part of the generic final year course on moral and political philosophy commonly given by the college president.  ""Political economy"" was added to his title in 1826, when it was decided that the final year course should include some economics lectures.  Although welcomed by McVickar, it was not his main interest.  McVickar was devoted to the traditional classical curriculum, and taught everything - classics, theology, rhetoric & belles lettres, and ethics, history and economics in the final year.  McVickar was reasonably well-acquainted with the British Ricardian economists and drew from them extensively.  His early economic texts (1825, 1826) were just annotated reprints of J.R. McCulloch's articles from  Britannica.  The extensive introduction and notes by McVickar contain some observations critical of Ricardian doctrines and make adjustments for the case of America.. In his anonymous 1827 treatise on banking, McVickar denounced the ""monopolies"" of bank charters and advocated a ""free banking"" system for the United States, presaging the Jacksonian reaction in the 1830s.. McVickar maintained his heavy teaching load at Columbia for the next forty years, until 1857, when Columbia decided to expand the economics offering.  Advancing in age, and already feeling himself drawn too thin, McVickar's responsibilities were split.  He yielded the economics and history lectures to a new professor Francis Lieber, and other courses to other lecturers, confining himself to theology until his final retirement in 1864.

Carl Menger , 1840-1921.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/menger.htm," Carl Menger has been hailed as one of the three leaders of the ""Marginalist Revolution"" of the 1870s, along with William Stanley Jevons and Léon Walras. However, Menger's Grundsätze (Principles), published in 1871, eschewed all the mathematical scaffolding that characterized the works of the other two revolutionaries. As such, many economists have insisted that Menger should be placed apart. In at least one sense, he can be considered different. Unlike Jevons or Walras, Carl Menger founded a proper ""school of thought"" which has more-or-less retained its distinctive character since - namely, the Austrian School. His two disciples, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and Friedrich von Wieser did much to advance and forge that school. Menger's Grundsätze (1871) was conceived originally as the first volume of a larger treatise - but the rest never materialized. The Grundsätze was concerned mostly with setting out the concepts of marginalist value theory, namely using the concept of subjective value to underpin all of economics. Although he did not formally use the term ""marginal"", he did claim that people rank-ordered their needs and applied successive units of goods to satisfying less and less urgent needs. The ""value"" of a good, Menger claimed, would be the equal to the least urgent use to which it was applied. Only later did his disciple Wieser apply the term ""diminishing marginal utility"" to Menger's scheme. Note that he did not conceive of ""needs"" being cardinally measurable, only that a good will be consumed to the point where the further consumption of a unit of that good will satisfy a less urgent need than the consumption of another good which he could have bought instead - in modern terms, until the marginal utility of two goods are equal relative to their price. Menger's theory of production was also simple enough: factors and intermediate goods (""goods of higher order"") were demanded only because consumer goods (""goods of first order"") were demanded. The subjective determination of consumption demands, Menger claimed, would, in turn, determine the demand for factors of production. The problem of ""imputing"" the value of factors from the subjective valuation of commodities was the exact reverse of Classical theory! Menger's ""imputation theorem"" was to be a central concern of Wieser and the later Austrian school. The way Menger set out to explain his theory of price was also interesting: he began with pure exchange between individuals, then under conditions of monopoly, then oligopoly before finally formulating the case under pure competition.  Menger's chapter of the marketability of a ""commodity"", in particular his distinction between quality and quantity is also highly interesting. Menger's distinction between ""economic goods"" (goods which are scarce) and ""non-economic goods"" (free goods) was to become instrumental in later Neo-Walrasian theory.  It also might be important to note, as later Austrians have stressed, the element of time and uncertainty in Menger. While Menger did have an adjustment process for the establishment of price, he did not have an ""auctioneer"" outright but rather had his agents inching their way along, making errors and correcting them, over a long period of time.  There are no ""equilibrium"" prices, if by this we mean a set of prices at which exchange will be effectuated simultaneously to everyone's full satisfaction.  Rather, prices are ""symptoms of an equilibrium between individuals involved in an exchange process. Menger had submitted his Grundsätze as his habilitation thesis at Vienna.  After an interlude as a tutor to the ill-fated Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria-Hungary, Menger achieved a post as lecturer at the University of Vienna in 1873 (provisionally holding the Vienna chair which had been abruptly vacated by his predecessor, Albert Schäffle, in 1871).  Menger would go on to become ordinary (full) professor at the University Vienna in 1879.  He held that position until his retirement in 1903. When Menger's Grundsätze emerged in 1871, its subjective theory of value was a complete contradiction of the Classical theory of value. However, published obscurely in German, the opposition arose not from the old Classical economists but rather from the German Historical School, then dominant in German universities. Led by Gustav Schmoller, they denounced Menger's work as an ""irrelevant abstraction"" and, using their political power over German academia, ensured that none of Menger's followers and none of his work could make inroads in Central Europe. During this period, Menger shelved his work on the other volumes he was planning and launched a counter-strike in 1883 with his Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences (the Untersuchungen). It was a biting and sweeping polemic against the ""Historical method"" and a brilliant defense of economic theory which can still be read with much profit today. The Methodenstreit was on: Schmoller and Menger locked horns for the next couple of years (e.g. Menger, 1884) and the debate was carried on into the 20th Century by their disciples. Although it can be said that Menger won the day (Schmoller stopped replying), the German Historicists kept their hold on the German university system well into the middle of the next century. Menger's engagement with the German Historicists and his secluded life at the University of Vienna kept him out of the confrontation with the Classical economists and the construction of the new economics that Jevons and Walras were avidly pursuing. Nonetheless, Menger's contributions would eventually find their way in. Through the Austrian influence upon Fetter in America and Smart, Wicksteed, Robbins and the rest of the L.S.E. in Britain, his theory of alternative cost, the concept of supply as ""reverse demand"", (just) kept the marginalist theory from being completely swallowed up by the Marshallian ""synthesis"" of Classical and Marginalist doctrines. Indeed, Menger's insights would be instrumental in advancing Neo-Walrasian theory: in the Vienna Colloquium run by his son, Karl Menger, Menger senior's insistence on subjective value and his distinction between economic and non-economic goods would be instrumental for breaking Walrasian theory away from the Cassel system of equations and the forging of modern Neo-Walrasian general equilibrium theory. Thus, while the Austrian School has maintained that Menger was distinctly different from the rest - whether because of his stress on subjective valuation, on disequilibrium, on his lack of mathematics, on the spontaneous evolution of institutions (such as his famous work on money - see 1892) - there is nonetheless no denying that much of his work and insights have found their way into modern economics in a meaningful sense. As John Hicks would later put it, ""I yield to no one the honour I give to Menger"" (Hicks, 1973).      Major Works of Carl Menger   Resources on Carl Menger   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Karl Menger, 1902-1985.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kmenger.htm," Austrian mathematician and philosopher. Karl Menger was the only son of the Austrian School economist Carl Menger.  Menger junior entered the University of Vienna in 1920, originally intending to study physics, but eventually switching and earning his doctorate in mathematics by 1924.  Menger proceeded to the University of Amsterdam to work under intuitionist mathematician L.E.J. Brouwer. Two years later. Menger returned to Austria in 1927 to take up the position of professor of geometry at the University of Vienna.  Shortly after his arrival, Menger was invited to attend the logical-positivist philosophical discussion group known as the ""Vienna Circle"" (f. 1922 by Moritz Schlick, Otto Neurath, etc.). In economics, Karl Menger is best known for organizing the ""Vienna Colloquium"" in 1928, a mathematical colloquium which was an important forum for the resurrection of Walrasian general equilibrium theory in economics in the early 1930s.  Menger  also helped launch uncertainty theory. with his article on Bernoulli's expected utility hypothesis (1934), and encouraged John von Neumann to look into its axiomatization. With the atmosphere deteriorating during the Austro-fascist Dolfuss regime and increasing Nazi agitation, Karl Menger left Austria in 1937, a year in advance of the Anschluss.   He would spend the rest of his career in the United States, initially at Notre Dame, later (from 1946) at the Illinois Institute of Technology.

Tomas de Mercado, 1530-1576.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/schools/salamanca.htm#mercado," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by University of Salamanca or any other organization. See the official University of Salamanca website] The University of Salamanca, one of the oldest universities in the world (founded c.1218, certainly before 1230 by the King of Leon), and the earliest extant in Spain. It was a prominent Dominican bastion in the late Scholastic period.  It was one of the homes of  Thomistic theology, even after the doctrines of St. Thomas Aquinas were disintegrating elsewhere in Europe first under the Scotist and Nominalist onslaughts, and then from the Reformation.   The ""School of Salamanca"" usually refers to the 16th C. legal, political and economic commentaries through a merging of Thomist theology and Humanist philosophy, to create a body of natural, international and economic law.  This approach was initiated by the leading figures of the university, notably Francisco de Vitoria in the 1530s.  The Salamanca school counted Domingo de Soto and  Navarrus as its most prominent theoreticians.  During the inflationary 16th century, theologians were appealed to repeatedly on economic affairs, particularly the status of contracts in those confusing economic times.  In an effort to lay down guidelines for commercial practice and focusing on practical notions of the public good, they moved away from past dogma and approached their questions in the spirit of natural law philosophy.  The result was reversal of centuries of Scholastic thinking on economic matters.  It was the Salamanca school that defined the just price as no more and no less than the naturally exchange-established price.  Their analysis led them to trace a scarcity theory of value and employed supply-and-demand with dexterity. They rejected Duns Scotus's ""cost of production"" conception of the just price, arguing that there was no objective way of determining price.    Before Bodin, but after Copernicus, Salamanca scholars independently uncovered the essential properties of the Quantity Theory of Money and used it to explain the general price inflation of the 1500s. They also providing a resounding defense of usury. It is common to associate early Jesuit philosophers like Leonard Lessius, Luis Molina, and Juan de Mariana, with the Salamanca school.  Although many Jesuit philosophers, notably Toledo, Suarez and de Lugo, passed through Salamanca and interacted with its scholars, their connection to that Dominican bastion was less tight and they can perhaps be set apart (some suggest calling them the 'Coimbra School', on account of Fonseca, Molina and Suarez, but that is also not quite right).  Nonetheless, the Jesuits reached many of the same conclusions on many economic doctrines and certainly both contributed to the transition between Scholastic and Natural Philosophy.  One may perhaps deduce a distinction between their approaches - the Dominicans of Salamanca, consulted so often by the government, had a practical eye on the smooth and proper functioning of the Spanish state and empire; the Jesuit commentators seemed to take a more theoretical approach, closer to social philosophy, an outcome of their underlying human-focused theology and a general urge to revise Catholic method away from traditional Dominican Scholasticism.  However, The Jesuit Order ('Society of Jesus'), founded in 1540 by St. Ignatius de Loyola, was erected to combat the appeal of Protestantism.  Against the Calvinist doctrine of predestination, the Jesuits had taken to emphasizing the importance of free human will (sometimes to the point where they were accused of resurrecting the 5th C. Pelagian heresy by their Dominican rivals, as happened to Lessius in 1588 and Molina in 1597).   The Jesuit emphasis on the human will translated into a more wide-ranging political and economic philosophy that stressed the human role (to the exclusion of divine providence) in all manner of things and thus brought it closer to a natural philosophy approach.  The Scholastic doctrine of 'just price' was rejected out of hand as all-too-divine, the Jesuits arguing that value is a human affair and was determined by natural human interaction on markets.  They followed much the same line on money and inflation. On moral defenses of usury and profit, the Jesuits were eager to reform Catholic doctrine to bring it more in line with current practice, to ease their efforts to overcome the resistance of Protestant towns to re-catholicization. Quite more controversial was the Jesuit view of the basis of civil government, something the Salamanca scholars had largely and judiciously avoided.  In line with their general approach,  Jesuits like Molina, de Mariana and Suarez proposed that government rested on human consent rather than divine right.  This landed them in hot water with royal authorities.  Already resented as an ultramontanist agents (as the 'footsoldiers of the Pope', the Jesuits were not beholden to bishops, inquisitors or the national churches), Jesuit musings on the human rather than divine sources of government made them downright subversive to the established order.  It did not help matters that, notoriously, the Jesuit philosopher Juan de Mariana (1598) openly contemplated that the murder of a monach might be justified, if he proved tyrannical to the people.  This was uttered at a tense time of notorious political assassinations - Henry IV of France (attempted in 1595, succeeded in1610), James I of England (Gunpowder Plot, 1605), Paolo Sarpi of Venice (attempted, 1606), etc. - in which Jesuit activists were suspected of having a role (and may indeed have had one).  In the popular mindset of the time, the Jesuits became synonymous with regicide and political destabilization.   The Jesuits were temporarily expelled from France in 1595-1603, and were kept under watchful eye elsewhere, their subversive treatises frequently proscribed and burnt at public trial.  It was really only after the 1650s, when the Jesuits defeated the Jansenists (a French crypto-Calvinist Catholic sect, popular with parliaments and considered a threat to royal absolutism) in theological dispute, that the Jesuits earned their ticket into the royal courts of Europe and went from being regarded as nearly extra-statal terrorists to the reactionary upholders of royal power and the ancien regime.  [Although the old subversive 'regicide' label was resurrected by Enlightenment philosophers in the 1750s in an effort to dislodge the Jesuits from power and influence in the royal courts, a campaign orchestrated by the Marquis de Pombal, that ended up with the expulsion of the Jesuits from Portugal, Naples, Spain and France and the eventual reluctant suppression of the order by the Pope in 1773.]  Both the Salamanca scholars and the Jesuits had instrumental roles in the the easing of Church restrictions on markets, profits and, notably, the ban on usury.  The growth of commerce and capitalism in the 16th C. had led to the development of financial instruments which seemed to mock the old restrictions, and the popes had been roused to issue bulls condemning them. Pope Pius V's 1569 Cum Onus condemned personal annuities (quite common in Germany) as usurious, his 1571 In Eam condemned interest replicated in many businesses partnerships by the famous 'triple contract' (contractum trinius), while Pope Sixtus V's 1586 Detestabilis Avaritia condemned the interest implied by bank bills of exchange, a growing practice in intra-European commerce.  Nonetheless Salamanca scholars like De Soto and Navarrus and Jesuits like Lessius and Toledo, rushed to issue clarifications and commentaries that reduced the force of these bulls, found interpretations, exceptions and opened up loopholes which effectively legitimated the practices (althought their positions would not be formally reconciled with papal decrees until the 18th C.) The theoretical accomplishments of the Salamanca theorists and the early Jesuits in defense of markets have led some economists such as Friedrich von Hayek to suggest that, contrary to Max Weber's thesis, it is perhaps the religion of the Catholics and not the Calvinists, that set the grounds for capitalism.

Paul Pierre le Mercier de la Rivière, 1720-1794.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/riviere.htm," Pierre Paul François Joachim Henri Le Mercier de La Rivière de Saint-Médard  (his full name is quite a mouthful!) was a Physiocratic philosopher and economist. From a wealthy family of Saint-Médard, Mercier de la Rivière was a magistrate and councillor in the parlement of Paris from 1747 and an intendant of the Caribbean colony of Martinique from 1759 to 1764. In the mid-1760s, Mercier de la Rivière was recruited by Mirabeau into the Physiocrat sect.  In 1767, he published his most famous work, l'Ordre naturel.  Here, Mercier de la Rivière concentrated on Physiocratic political philosophy, articulating a theory of the State in terms of ""natural"" rights and duties in a manner consistent with the laissez-faire policies recommended by the Physiocrats.  There was, he claimed, an original ""contract"" between private individuals and government, where the government's took up the duty to ""secure"" private property of individuals and in return acquired the right to a share of the produit net which it takes up in the form of taxation.  In his words, the government, by ""divine right"", has ""co-proprietorship"" of property and hence a right to a share. But, Mercier de la Rivière cautions, this share is not ""arbitrary"" and no more should be claimed than what is absolutely necessary to perform the ""natural"" functions of government (i.e. secure property).    One of his more interesting conclusions is that the laissez-faire doctrine should apply equally to foreign trade as well as domestic.  In other words, Mercier de la Rivière not only recommended that internal restrictions on commerce be lifted, but also external ones.  He argued for this in terms of the ""natural"" responsibilities of the government to the exporters and importers among its citizenry -- and that considerations of the policies of other nations should not be involved.  In other words, a nation should lift its external trade restrictions unilaterally, even if all other countries happen to have protectionist regimes. Famously, it was Mercier de la Rivière who best articulated the Physiocratic theory of ""enlightened despotism"".  In effect, he argued that the function of government was making human laws in accordance with ""natural"" laws.  Surprisingly, Mercer de la Rivière believed that republican governments are too beholden to various private interests to ever be able to govern ""well"" (i.e. according to ""natural"" laws).  An absolutist monarch, beholden to no one and owing no one, is in a much better position to do so -- although the historical record shows that they tend to govern arbitrarily and thus no better.  But he blames this arbitrariness not on a lack of will to govern well, but rather on a lack of knowledge of the natural laws.  If an absolutist monarch were ""educated"" about to the natural laws, he would be much more effective at implementing them than a republican government ever could. He paints a picture of an ""ideal"" society and holds up imperial China as the example to follow. Mercier de la Rivière's endorsement of the ""enlightened despot"", naturally, infuriated the closet republicans of Enlightenment France, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau.  The Abbé de Mably's 1768 treatise was a powerful point-by-point assault on Mercier de la Rivière's book.  Mercier de la Rivière's arguments and celebrity led the powerful Empress Catherine II of Russia to summon him to St. Petersburg in 1767 as a consultant for her political reforms.  However, he cut a very bad impression.  Mercier de la Rivière babbled on about the necessity of setting up the State in accordance with ""nature's plan"", without giving any practical legislative suggestions.  The famous exchange went reportedly as follows: Cath.: ""Sir, could you tell me the best way to govern a State well?""
M.d.R.: ""There is only one, Madame, it is to be just, i.e. maintain order, and enforce the laws.""
Cath.: ""But on what basis should the laws of an empire repose?""
M.d.R.: ""On one alone, Madame, the nature of things and of men.""
Cath.: ""Exactly, but when one wishes to give laws to a people, what rules indicate most surely the laws which suit it best?""
M.d.R.: ""To give or make laws, Madame, is a task which God has left to no one. Ah! what is man, to think himself capable of dictating laws to beings whom he knows not, or knows so imperfectly? And by what right would he impose laws upon beings whom God has not placed in his hands?""
Cath.: ""To what, then, do you reduce the science of government?""
M.d.R.: ""To study well, to recognize and manifest, the laws which God has so evidently engraven in the very organization of man, when He gave him existence. To seek to go beyond this would be a great misfortune and a destructive undertaking.""
Cath.: ""Monsieur, I am very pleased to have heard you. I wish you good-day."" Mercier de la Rivière quickly became the laughing stock of the Russian Court and quietly returned to France in 1768.  Catherine's brief interest in Physiocracy came to an abrupt and disgusted end.        Major Works of Mercier de la Rivière      Resources on Mercier de la Rivière   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

James Mill, 1773-1836.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/jamesmill.htm," Scottish writer, utilitarian philosopher, Radical political leader and prominent Classical economist. Of humble background, James Mill (née Milne) was born in Montrose, Scotland, the son of a cobbler.  Encouraged by his mother, Mill attended to his studies and eventually, in 1790, enrolled at the University of Edinburgh with the help of a local gentleman, Sir John Stuart (after whom Mill later named his son).  At Edinburgh, he came under the influence of the philosopher Dugald Stewart and imbibed the legacy of the Scottish Enlightenment, including the economic works of Adam Smith. Originally intending to become a minister of the Church of Scotland, Mill received his M.A. in 1794.  Mill left Edinburgh in 1797, with a license to preach but gradually lost his faith.  He worked for a while as an itinerant tutor in Scotland until 1802, when Stuart invited Mill join him in London.  James Mill immigrated to England with a mind to become a professional writer.  He tried his hand at journalism, landing a steady job at the Literary Journal and feeling confident enough to marry Harriet Burrow in 1805.  However, the journal folded in 1806, and soon enough Mill's only source of income (often precarious) was as a freelance writer of articles, editorials and essays for a wide assortment of newspapers and journals, notably the rising Whig journal, The Edinburgh Review, founded by fellow Scottish immigrants. While still at the Literary Journal in 1804, James Mill published his first economic treatise reviewing the history of the Corn Laws, calling for the removal of all export bounties and import duties on grains and criticizing Malthus for defending them.  Soon afterwards, he came across the tracts of Cobbett and Spence, who had made a series of controversial points: that land (rather than industry) was the source of wealth, that there were losses to foreign trade between nations, that the public debt was not a burden,  that taxes were productive and that crises were caused by a general glut of goods.  In response, James Mill wrote his Commerce Defended (1807) dismantling all these arguments one by one.   It was here that Mill articulated his version of Say's Law of Markets (after Say, of course, who's Traite he had reviewed in 1805).  Mill argued that ""annual purchases and sales"" will ""always balance"" (1807: p.82) so the excess supply of any good was necessarily counterbalanced by excess demand for other goods.  Or, more accurately, he argued that the overproduction of of one good had to be made from capital withdrawn from other goods, which were thus left, necessarily, underproduced: ""A nation may easily have more than enough of any one commodity, though she can never have more than enough of commodities in general.  The quantity of any one commodity may easily be carried beyond its due proportion, but by that very circumstance is implied that some other commodity is not provided in sufficient proportion.  What is indeed meant by a commodity's exceeding the market?  Is it not that there is a portion of it for which there is nothing that can be had in exchange.  But of those other things then the proportion is too small.  A part of the means of production which had been applied to the preparation of this superabundant commodity, should have been applied to the preparation of those other commodities till the balance between them has been established.  Whenever this balance is properly preserved, there can be no superfluity of commodities, none for which a market will not be ready."" (Mill, 1807 [1808] p.84-5).  A partisan of the ""Banking School"", James Mill also participated in the Bullionist Controversies of the time (e.g. Mill, 1808).  It was around 1808 that Mill forged long-lasting friendships with two very influential men: David Ricardo and Jeremy Bentham.  Ricardo would provide him his economics, a continuation of his own, while Bentham would guide his political and social philosophy. Interestingly, the two influences seemed to never have met each other in the mind of James Mill.  With a few exceptions, it never occurred to him to bring the Benthamite concept of utility into his economics, nor even to bring the utilitarian ""greatest happiness"" principle to bear on the analysis of economic policy.  For all their close collaboration, Bentham never completely exorcised the Scottish liberal heritage in James Mill.    The influence was returned.  Mill has been greatly credited with pushing Ricardo to explore, articulate and publish his ideas, and with pushing Bentham in a democratic direction, embracing parliamentary reform, ballots and universal suffrage. It is alleged (not least by Mill himself) that the Edinburgh Review stifled and edited out Mill's radical political arguments.  But in the series of supplements to Encyclopedia Britannica from 1816 to 1824, Mill found fewer restrictions and took the opportunity to articulate his political philosophy, culminating in his famous radical essay on Government (1820), the most complete defense on democracy on the basis of utilitarian philosophy, rather than any ""natural law"" considerations. Widespread democracy and civil rights were, Mill argued, the best way to ensure a good, stable and efficient government.  This essay was famously torn apart by Thomas Macaulay.   Throughout this time, Mill's financial precariousness had not ceased.  Throughout the 1810s, he depended on the generosity of his friends, notably Jeremy Bentham and even his own young disciple and personal manager, Francis Place.   From 1814, despite a near-break with Bentham over a personal slight, Mill subleased a house on Queen's Square, London, from Bentham at a subsidized rent and lived with him on his country residences during the season.  But Mill (and his son, John Stuart Mill) found himself obliged to return the kindness by vigorous collaboration with their eccentric landlord, sorting through the Aegean stables of Bentham's manuscripts on legal and utilitarian topics, hammering them into presentable and publishable form.  In 1817, Mill produced his massive History of India, which he had been working on the side for many years.  Its analysis was clearly inspired by the conjectural histories typical of the Scottish Enlightenment: India was deemed a nation just emerging out of its barbarian stage and saw the English role as a civilizing mission (although he would later famously claim that the British Empire was ""a vast system of outdoor relief for the upper classes"").  He defended the rule of the East India Company (rather than the English government). Mill recommended several reforms for India, perhaps the most interesting was his call for the elimination of taxes and the complete nationalization of land (EIC fiscal revenue would thus arise from rents -- which he believed were easier to collect and less distortionary).  The success of his History led him to be hired by the London office of the East India Company in 1819, which finally provided him with financial security for the remainder of his life.   In the meantime, Mill was busy forging the Classical Ricardian School in economics. An energetic man, it was Mill who encouraged David Ricardo to publish his 1817 treatise on value and distribution and then pushed him to run for Parliament. In 1821, Mill helped found the Political Economy Club in London, which became a stomping ground for Ricardian economists and Benthamite radicals.   After Ricardo's death, James Mill, Ramsey McCulloch and Thomas de Quincey became the high priests of  Ricardian economics.  James Mill's Elements of Political Economy, (1821) quickly became the leading textbook exposition of doctrinaire Ricardian economics.  As this was compiled from the lectures on political economy he had given to his young son, John Stuart Mill, there were was little that was novel in it -- except for the ill-fated ""Wages Fund"" doctrine:  ""Universally, then, we may affirm, other things remaining the same, that if the ratio which capital and population bear to one another remains the same, wages will remain the same; if the ratio which capital bears to population increases, wages will rise; if the ratio which population bears to capital increases, wages will fall."" (J. Mill, 1821: p.44) Mill continued advancing the utilitarian doctrines of Bentham and the ""Philosophical Radicals"" until the end.  Although, the Mill-Bentham relationship had its complicated and heated moments, nonetheless, Mill remained an uncritical admirer of Bentham's philosophy and its principal propagator. It must also be noted that Mill, unlike Bentham, was a great advocate of government non-intervention in the economy, and thus very much a classical liberal.  Mill was a strict ""welfarist"", excluding social justice and any other such considerations from all utilitarian ""greatest happiness"" calculations.  Consequently, Mill argued that fiscal policy should be designed so as to leave  the status quo in place (e.g. proportional rather than progressive taxation).  It was Mill who was mostly responsible for forwarding the argument that since each individual acts in his own self-interest, then any  collection of people necessarily acts in the interest of the whole.  Mill was also a great advocate of widespread education.  He believed, like Bentham, that people need to be educated so as to best be able to figure out what is their own best interest.  But he added that what is in their own self-interest is often quite complicated.  This includes consideration of the impact of their actions on other people, choosing the right government and pushing for the right policies.  Wage claims by trade unions or protection against foreign commerce, for instance, might seem to be in the self-interest of workers, but a truly educated workforce would realize that their long-run interests are best served otherwise.  His belief that people were myopic, in the sense that they underestimated their future utility, was one of the earliest articulations of the ""time preference"" idea. In psychology, Mill is widely regarded as the father of ""monism"" or ""association of ideas"" in mental states.  Mill's 1829 Analysis originated as an attempt to decipher the psychological foundations of utilitarianism.   However, he ended up closer to the ""moral sentiments"" theories of  Adam Smith and the Scottish philosophers than to anything Bentham would have envisioned.  Mill helped found the Westminster Review, the publishing organ of the Philosophical Radicals, in 1824.  He is also largely responsible for the foundation of University College and the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (an working class adult education movement), which probably owes more to his earlier work on education reform than to Bentham. After another personal quarrel with Bentham in 1828, Mill moved out of the Queen's Square and acquired a new home of his own in Kensington in 1830.  He continued working with the East India Company, famously defending the company before the Parliamentary Select Committee of 1831-32.   In the political field, he as a moving force behind the Reform Bill and served as an advisor to the chancellor, Lord Brougham before his death in 1836. Mill's role in the history of both economics and philosophy is largely as a popularizer of existing theories, rather than as an original thinker.   To posterity, James Mill's greatest claim to fame was undoubtedly his legendary role as the father of John Stuart Mill.   As it turns out, this may perhaps have been his most important contribution to the development of economics, politics and philosophy in the 19th Century.

John Stuart Mill, 1806-1873.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/mill.htm," British philosopher, Classical  economist, prophet of liberalism and public intellectual. The particulars of Mill's life are too well known - as laid out in his famous Autobiography (1873) for instance - to be worth repeating here, so we will just rattle them out: son of the Ricardian economist James Mill, trained from an early age to be a genius, ""lent"" by his father to utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham, became a utilitarian himself, followed his father into the British East India Company, broke with Bentham, had an existentialist crisis, turned to the doctrines of Saint-Simon and Comte, met Harriet Taylor and waited twenty years for her husband to die, became a public intellectual Whig politician, etc., etc. J.S. Mill was an economist, a Classical economist following the footsteps of this father, James Mill, contributing articles on economics already in the early 1820s, while still a teenager, to the Westminster Review.  In 1844, J.S. Mill published his Essays on Some Unsettled Question , which he began writing over a decade earlier (around 1831), largely in response to the challenge of the Oxford-Dublin school.  It includes a methodological essay on the scope of economics (orig. published in 1836).  John Stuart Mill's greater economic performance was his magnificent 1848 Principles of Political Economy, a two-volume extended restatement of the Classical Ricardian theory,  He believed  Ricardo's labor theory of value to be so conclusive that, in the beginning of a discussion on the theory of value, Mill confidently notes that: ""Happily, there is nothing in the laws of Value which remains for the present or any future writer to clear up; the theory of the subject is complete: the only difficulty to be overcome is that of so stating it as to solve by anticipation the chief perplexities which occur in applying it."" (J.S. Mill, Principles, 1848: Book III, Ch. 1). Thus putting a stone on the matter, and burying supply-and-demand theory for another quarter-century.  When Jevons's later grumbled at the ""noxious influence of authority"" preventing the development of economics, there is little doubt he was referring to J.S. Mill.

John Millar, 1735-1801.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/millar.htm," Scottish Enlightenment philosopher, economic historian and Professor of Civil Law at the University of Glasgow.  John Millar is only known to have authored two works.  A deep admirer of Adam Smith, John Millar is best know for this Distinctions of Ranks, applying Smith's theories of civilizational stages to explain the development of hierarchical structures of society, politics, workplaces and the family.  His other named work is his posthumously published History of English Government, considered a classical epitome of Whiggish economic history.  (Millar was an early classical liberal, politically devoted  to the Rockingham Whigs). Millar was the teacher of the elusive John Craig, and Craig's own 1814 Elements thesis is believed to by some scholars to be a paraphrasing of Millar's lectures on political science at Glasgow.  Millar is believed to have authored a series of anonymous letters to the Scots Chronicle in 1796.  These  later compiled together as the Letters of Crito and (with more uncertainty) the Letters of Sidney (it has been alternatively posited Craig was the author of the latter).

Following the initial suggestions of Langton (1857), Mills set about amassing and plotting data from multiple sources - prices,  bank reserves, bullion, interest rates, bankruptcies, pauperism, etc. - to prove that the existence of a ten-year cycle in economic activity was correlated with credit, and 'business mood' - ""decennial fits of terror"".  Identified easy credit, speculative excess and overoptimistic expectations as characteristic of a boom, and argued for the usefulness of the suspension of convertibility in averting the worst effects of a crisis.

Hyman P. Minsky, 1919-1996.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/minsky.htm," American Post Keynesian economist at Washington University, St. Louis.. Originating from Chicago, Hyman Minsky initially studied mathematics at the University of Chicago, but switched ton economics and eventually received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1954, under Alvin H. Hansen.  Minsky taught at Carnegie-Mellon, Brown and Berekely, before taking up a position at Washington University in 1965. Hyman Minsky is most famous for his financial instability hypothesis.  His theory is articulated in his 1975 John Maynard Keynes, and with more detail in his 1986 Stabilizing an Unstable economy. Minsky began his JMK book as a general critique of the Neo-Keynesian synthesis view of the work of John Maynard Keynes from a Post Keynesian perspective, accusing conventional economists of assuming stability of long-run full employment, ignoring uncertainty (""Hamlet without the prince""), missing the (Kaleckian) connection between investment and profits, and essentially overlooking the role and vital importance that the financial system plays in a modern economy and its potentially destabilizing features, which (Minsky argues) was the core of Keynes's concerns. Minsky articulated a business cycle theory driven by financially-fueled investment. Minsky's emphasis was in noting how the character of the financing changes over the course of the cycle. Minsky proposes that in the upswing, investment is financed by a mixture of retained profits and borrowed funds. But as the boom continues, firms are encouraged to borrow more and expand more, thus the financial composition changes increasingly towards debt, and ever more profits are designated to service it.  Firms (and households) moved to ever more risky financing strategies, and with increasing debt burdens, firms became ""financially fragile"", where lower-than-expected earnings or a slight change in interest rates can have massive repercussions on a heavily indebted firm.  A firm squezed in this manner will not necessarily fail immediately, but be pushed into Ponzi financing, acquiring debt to pay off debt, postponing the reckoning while increasing its fragility.  The failure subsequently cascades to its lenders, and the credit crunch in the financial system and the economic system decline in the mortal embrace of a Fisherian debt-deflation crisis.  

Minsky believe financial instability is a characteristic feature of the post-war economy, and that the very institutional and policy measures introduced by governments to to stabilize economies themselves sometimes contribute to the problem. Reliance on their availability induces risky behavior and encourages unsustainable booms to go on for longer, and accumulate even greater debt burdens, so that the unraveling becomes even more devastating than otherwise.  Nonetheless, Minsky saw vital roles active government fiscal policy and monetary policy (more the Fed's lender of last resort function than its interest rate policy) to keep downturns contained so that they do not turn into depressions, although remaining skeptical on just how effective they might be if considered too late.

"Victor de Riqueti, Marquis de Mirabeau", 1715-1789.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/mirabeau.htm," French aristocrat and early leader of the Physiocratic sect.  Victor Riquetti, Marquis de Mirabeau, was an aspiring statesman, bubbling over in the Enlightenment spirit, a ""feudal character invaded by democratic ideas"", as de Tocqueville would characterize him.  Mirabeau's first treatise (1750) called for the decentralization of the tax system across France so that the central government could simply make a lump sum demand for revenues from a province, and leave it up to provincial authorities to raise them as they saw fit.  Such a system was indeed in place in the frontier provinces of France -- the so-called Pays d'État -- but in most other provinces -- the Pays d'Élection -- it was the royal representative (the intendant) who had to decide how to allocate the tax burdens.  What Mirabeau called for was simply the elimination of the latter system and the extension of the former to all of France. Mirabeau had long been in possession of a manuscript version of  Richard Cantillon's Essai from which he drew many of his ideas and contemplated publishing it under his own name.  In the end, he decided against it.  Instead, he had Cantillon's essay published in 1755 and decided to compose a separate series of commentaries on it.  These came out in 1756, under the signature of L'Ami des Hommes --  the ""Friend of Mankind"" -- an appellation by which Mirabeau became known (often derisorily) for the remainder of his life (he would sign many of his works simply as L.D.H.)   In his commentaries, Mirabeau seems to have misinterpeted the wage-fertility dynamics of Cantillon's theory.  He was left with the impression that ""population"" was the measure of a nation's wealth and policy should be geared to maximizing population growth.  To this end, Mirabeau argued for loosening restrictions on grain imports in order to lower food prices.  He also recommended the promotion of small peasant-proprietorship in land, which he believed would encourage stabler livelihoods and thus larger families among the peasantry, as well as avoid the unproductiveness of ""absentee ownership"", so prevalent with large farms.  The book was, to say the least, a sensation, going through multiple editions, and the ""Friend of Mankind"" was discussed in every salon. Intrigued, the wizened court physician, François Quesnay, summoned the ""Friend of Mankind"" to a meeting in July 1757 at his entresol in Versailles to ""set him right"" on these points.  Quesnay relayed to Mirabeau the economic doctrine he was himself developing and the points of contact between their theories.  Population, Quesnay insisted, was the effect, not the cause, of wealth.  The wealth of a nation is the ""net product"" of its agricultural sector and this is best achieved by higher grain prices (i.e. discouraging imports) and agricultural efficiency is best served by economies of scale (i.e. large farms).  In that celebrated evening, Mirabeau was won over completely.  He became the first disciple of Quesnay and the most faithful of what would later be known as the ""Physiocratic"" sect.   A man of action more than thought, Mirabeau set it upon himself to popularize Quesnay's theory and recruit new members into the sect.  Most of the wide public became first acquainted with Quesnay's Tableau through its reproduction in the 'Continuation of Part 6' (1760) of Mirabeau's L'ami des hommes. [Note: The original 1756 l'ami des hommes consisted of three parts - the first on population and agriculture, the second on commerce and industry, the third on foreign trade and colonies. Mirabeau would append further writings between 1758 and 1760, bringing the total work up to eight parts.  The Tableau came out as the 'continuation' of the sixth part (thus sometimes just labeled the seventh part).] Mirabeau was the primary architect of the Physiocrats' ""single tax"" doctrine, expounded in his 1760 théorie de l'impôt.  This was a controversial book.  France was then in the process of losing what was left of its empire in the Seven-Years War.  To finance this, the Crown was wringing the country dry with an incredibly inept tax system, in which an estimated 2/3rds of the potential tax revenues were lost to private middlemen.  Interestingly, Mirabeau defended the tax exemptions enjoyed by the nobility in return for their public service as officers, judges, etc.  He believed this was better than abolishing the exemptions and using the tax revenues to hire a professional bureaucracy.   At least the exemption system put idle noblemen ""to work"", while the latter system would draw productive citizens away from useful activities like farming, manufacturing and commerce.  Besides, he speculated, professionalization of State office almost always meant corruption and inefficiency -- he held up the terrible results of private tax-farming to illustrate his point. Mirabeau bravely challenged not only the insanity and brutality of the French fiscal system, but also the very policy priorities of the French Crown.  In his outlandish prose, Mirabeau openly questioned the monarch's right to an empire, given his inability to govern well at home.  Clearly, by directly insulting King Louis XV, he had stepped over the line -- and the Madame de Pompadour could not protect him now. As could be expected, Mirabeau was hauled off to jail at Vincennes in December 1760.  Through Pompadour's intercession, Mirabeau was released, but warned to stay confined to his rural estates in Bignon and refrain from writing again.   Mirabeau remained quiet until the sudden appearance of the young DuPont de Nemours' treatise calling for fiscal reform along Physiocratic lines.  As the authorities had let this circulate, Mirabeau reasoned, he ought to venture returning to print.  That same year, Mirabeau published his soft-spoken Philosophie rurale, incorporating some of Quesnay's own work.  This has been considered the best statement of early Physiocratic doctrine. Riding on the coat-tails of his new celebrity, Mirabeau decided to expand the Physiocratic message out of the halls of Versailles and into Paris society.  Mirabeau's Paris home became the public headquarters of the Physiocratic sect -- which met, every Tuesday, for dinner and discussion (the reclusive Quesnay did not attend, but the conversations were relayed to him).   As a curious aside, we should note Mirabeau's role in the ""cheap mills"" movement.  Soon after the famine of 1767 and prodded by Baudeau, Mirabeau set up a cheap flour-mill and bakery upon his estate in Fleury and produced excellent bread which he sold to the population at two-thirds of the going price.  He made a pretty penny and ""proved"" the ridiculousness of feudal restriction of banalité (which required peasants to grind their flour in their lord's mill).  Mirabeau's ""cheap mill"" example was much followed by other ""enlightened"" noblemen. It was Mirabeau, more than anybody else, who is responsible for the curious reputation of the Physiocrats as a sect of mystical charlatans and insufferable sycophants.  His bold, unrestrained, flowery and half-reasoned rhetoric irked many about him.  Indeed, some have speculated that not only would Mirabeau have avoided his arrest but might actually have succeeded in furthering serious economic reforms, had he only used a milder and more sensible way of expressing himself. More than once, Voltaire used his sharp wit to poke fun at Mirabeau (whom he detested more at a personal than an intellectual level). The latter part of Mirabeau's life was enveloped in public scandal.  The ""Friend of Mankind"" had, apparently, been using the very instruments of aristocratic privilege, to persecute his unruly wife and rebellious children.   Mirabeau died on July 13th, 1789 -- the eve of the storming of the Bastille. He is also known as ""Mirabeau the Elder"" to distinguish him from his estranged son, Gabriel Honoré Riqueti, Comte de Mirabeau ('Mirabeau the Younger'), the great orator of the National Assembly during the French Revolution.

Edward Misselden, 1608-1654. ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/misselden.htm,"Official of the Society of Merchant Adventurers who responded to the challenges of Gerard de Malynes against the charter companies.  Together with Thomas Mun, Misselden helped establish the ""traditional"" English Mercantilist position.  In his 1622 tract, Misselden identified the ""decay of trade"" to lie in the lack of money in Britain.  But he also condemned the idea of a monopoly structure in trade, advocating instead free entry into companies. In his 1623 tract, Misselden used his famous term ""balance of trade"" (in his definition, the excess of exports over imports).   Contrary to Gerard de Malynes and the ""bullionist"" position, Misselden explained that gold movements and exchange rates were determined by the nation's ""balance of trade"", and not by ""evil practices"" of the trading companies or individual transactors. He argued for government policies to maintain favorable trade balance for the nation  as a whole to insure inflow of bullion, but that attempts to stop the outflow of bullion outright were counterproductive. Also promoted devaluation of British money in order to promote favorable trade balance. . Naturally, Malynes authored  refutations to Misselden's tracts.

Wesley Clair Mitchell, 1874-1948.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/mitchell.htm," American  Institutionalist at Columbia, leading researcher on business cycles and founder of the NBER. Originating from rural Illinois, Wesley Clair Mitchell enrolled at University of Chicago in 1896, initially to study classics, but ended up diverted into economics.  At Chicago, Mitchell came under the influence of Thorstein Veblen and John Dewey,. but received his Ph.D in 1899 under J. Laurence Laughlin and Adolph C. Miller on monetary questions   Mitchell stayed on at Chicago, a tireless contributor of book reviews to its house organ, the JPE.   In early 1903, Mitchell followed A.C. Miller's move to UC Berkeley.  Mitchell finally joined the faculty at Columbia University in 1908, where he would remain for the rest of his career.  Mitchell, perhaps more than anyone, would build Columbia into one of the most notable citadels of the American  Institutionalist School during the inter-war period.   Mitchell was one of the founders of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in 1920, and its first director of research.  After undertaking the NBER's founding study on income redistribution, Mitchell directed the NBER towards quantitative studies of the U.S. business cycles for which that organization has become renowned.   Mitchell would remain at the research helm of the NBER until xx Mitchell's life-long interest in business cycles culminated in his authoritative NBER opus with Arthur F. Burns, Measuring Business Cycles (1946). His two other books on business cycles (1912, 1927) give a view of Mitchell at his best. His students, which include Simon Kuznets, carried on much of Mitchell's work into the post-war period.   Although Mitchell followed the Institutionalists in eschewing agent-based theory, W.C. Mitchell's work was full of theoretical insights about society and the economy and he was a profound scholar of economic theory - as exemplified in his masterful lecture notes (1967). He also wrote many articles in Institutionalist theory. Mitchell was also one of the first directors of the New School for Social Research (from 1919 to 1931).      Major works of Wesley C.

Franco Modigliani, 1918-2003 ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/modigliani.htm," Neo-Keynesian macroeconomist at M.I.T. Originating from Italy, Franco Modigliani joined the emigre wave of the 1930s, and became a student of Jacob Marschak's at the New School for Social Research,  In the model presented in his Ph.D thesis (1944), Modigliani was to provide the nucleus of the Neo-Keynesian Synthesis of post-war macroeconomics. His further work went on to consolidate much of that research effort - whether in his ""Life-Cycle Hypothesis"" for the consumption function (1953) or in the building of large macroeconometric models - such as his famous MPS model. He also made several important contributions to theory of money and finance - notably, the fundamental ""Modigliani-Miller"" theorem (1958) of corporate finance and the ""Preferred Habitat"" theory (19??) for the term structure of interest rates. Modigliani was teaching at M.I.T. when he won the Nobel prize in 1985.      Major works of Franco Modigliani       Resources on Franco Modigliani   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Luis Molina, 1535-1600,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/molina.htm," Spanish Jesuit scholar, who spent most of his career in neighboring Portugal, studying at the venerable University of Coimbra, and later became a teacher and leading scholar of the new Jesuit University of Evora.  While commonly associated with the Salamanca School, Molina's theories should be considered part of a distinctive tradition, the 'Coimbra School', led by his humanist teachers, notably Pedro da Fonseca, the Jesuit provincial of Portugal and, at a more distant range, Lessius in Louvain. Molina is best known in Catholic theology for his Concordia (1588), an attempt to reconcile the freedom of the will with the grace of God - what is known as ""Molinism"" in theological circles.  This had been the principal question raised by Fonseca and the Coimbra school, but it was left to Molina to suggest the solution.  Molina's thesis allows for Divine Grace to act upon Human Will, but only as an imperfect and neutral factor, so that man is ultimately in control of his own salvation.  More precisely, he elaborated upon Fonseca's theory of 'foreknowledge' (or middle knowledge, scientia media), proposing that God has foreknowledge of which humans will try to act well of their own free will, and to these gives faith, although that grace is nowhere a determinant of the will. To orthodox Dominicans, who embraced Aquinas's somewhat unsatisfactory formula that grace is universal and predetermines free will, Molina's thesis smelled like the old 5th C. Pelagian heresy (that denied the doctrine of Grace and placed man fully in control of his own salvation, a position condemned by St. Augustine).  Although passing muster with the Portuguese Inquisition, Molina's thesis caused a firestorm in neighboring Spain, where the Dominicans were stronger  Accused of Pelagianism, Molina and the Jesuits retorted by characterizing the Dominican emphasis on predestination as crypto-Calvinism. The Pope convened a series of councils in Rome from 1597 to settle the quarrel,  but for much of the next decade, they did little more than serve as a forum for Jesuits and Dominicans to rage at each other.  At the end of the day, in 1607, the Dominicans had the upper hand and the council prepared to condemn Molina's doctrine as heresy, before Pope Paul V intervened at the last minute and declared that both views were consistent with Catholic theology and the church could live with the ambivalence.  Molina did not live to see his vindication. Molina's position on free human agency informed his theories of political philosophy.  Most notably, he articulates a natural theory of civil government based on free human consent, rather than divine right.  From here, Molina goes on a wide-ranging exploration of good government, which touches upon many issues of economics and economic policy.  Molina rejected Duns Scotus's cost theory of ""just price"" because of the incentives to raise expenses artificially.  He discussed competition and condemned ""monopolies"" as another way of artificially raising price.  Argued that the ""just price"" is the natural exchange-established price by the free interchange of agents on the market.  Also held  that the value of money ""arises from circumstances"".  In line with his general exaltation of human freedom, Luis Molina also articulated a strong condemnation of slavery. ['Molinism' became the Jesuit theology par excellence.  Molina's authority was invoked in the famously bitter quarrel in France in the 1640s and 1650s against the Jansenists (a more unabashedly crypto-Calvinist Catholic sect) over grace and free will, a quarrel which would have tremendous political and social ramifications.  Louis XIV sided decisively with the Jesuits, and broke the Jansenist-riddled institutions of learning in France, allowing the Jesuits to slip back into the center of political and scholarly life in France, from which they had been dislodged in the 1590s. As a result, later 18th C. Enlightenment thinkers, in an effort to break Jesuit control of schools, cited the quarrel with the Jansenists and characterized Molinism, to which they should have had a natural affinity, as an obscurantist and regressive doctrine, or at least turned into a weapon of obscurantism by later Jesuit scholars.]       Major Works of Luis de Molina     Resources on Luis Molina   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Gustave de Molinari, 1819-1912 ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/molinari.htm," Belgian-born Parisian journalist and radical laissez-faire ultra of the French Liberal School.  In the aftermath of the 1848 Revolutions, Molinari launched a journalist campaign against socialists of all stripes.  In a controversial 1849 article, Molinari argued that police and even defense should be provided by private companies.  Crossing Napoleon III, Molinari fled into exile in Belgium during the 1850s, where he became professor of political economy at the Musée royale de l'industrie belge.   Molinari returned to Paris in the 1860s, where he became editor of the Journal de debats.  His 1880 book discussed how capitalist society evolved as a reaction against class-ridden and exploitative societies.  From 1881 to 1909, Molinari was the editor of the highly-influential Journal des économistes, which he maintained as a pulpit for the laissez-faire doctrines of the French Liberal School.

Geminiano Montanari, 1633-1687.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/montanari.htm," Modenese (Italian) inventor, astronomer, mathematician and economist. Geminiano Montanari was born in Modena and educated in law in Salzburg (Austria).   In 1657, he entered the service of the Grand Duke of Tuscany as court philosopher and astronomer.  He returned to Modena in 1661, in the service of the Duke of Modena.  It was around this time that he meant the aristocratic astronomer, the Count Malvasia, who encouraged his interest in the subject.  Montanari's work with lenses permitted him to construct a better telescope.   Among Montanari's first achievements was his famous ""mapping"" of the surface of the moon in 1662.  In 1664, through Malvasia's good offices, Montanari acquired a position as professor of mathematics at the University of Bologna, thus permitting him to finally gain some independence from princely patrons.  In 1672, Montanari published his detailed observations of several start (notably, Algol), noting that they varied in their degree of brightness over time.  Thus, Montanari challenged the old notion of the eternal ""incorruptibility"" of the heavens. His 1685 tract ridiculed the then-competing ""science"" of astrology.  In 1678, Montanari acquired a chair in astronomy and meteorology at the University of Padua (in the Republic of Venice), but he had little time for it. Montanari was much consulted by the Venetian authorities on a variety of engineering questions -- including the organization of the Venetian mint.   It was as a result of this experience that Montanari published his two main economic texts (1680, 1683).  Here, Montanari expounds the metallist thesis and use-value theory of Davanzati almost verbatim.

Antoine de Montchrétien, 1575-1621.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/montchretien.htm," Easily one of the more colorful figures in the history of economics, Antoine de Montchrétien (or Montchréstien), Seigneur de Vasteville, was a French Mercantilist thinker - and dramatist, poet, duellist, hardware manufacturer, governor, arriviste nobleman and soldier of fortune - credited for originating the term ""political economy"". Born a commoner, the son of apothecarist, in Falaise (Normandy), Antoine de Montchrétien was orphaned early and taken under the wing of a local French nobleman, François Thésart, Seigneur des Essarts.  This allowed him to acquire a decent education at the schools of Caen, including in the noble arts of riding and swordmanship.  Around the turn of the century, Montchrétien emerged as a famous poet and dramatist, commonly associated with the fashionable Pléiade style.  He was the author classical tragedies of the French dramatic canon like La Cartaginoise (1596), L'Ecossaise (1601), Hector (1604), with emphasis on elaborate lyrical choruses. Throughout this period, he lived the stormy life of an artist, conjoined with the rascally persona of a quarrelsome young noble, engaging in continuous duels with his cohort.  However, he also engaged in some serious reading, having authored a history of Normandy (unpublished) during this time. In 1605, Montchrétien killed an adversary in a duel, and fearing the law (duels had been recently outlawed), fled to England. It is there that he became an economist.  His interest had been sparked by the spectacle of the exiled French Huguenot community, who were heavily engaged in the crafts industries and commerce in London.  He began reflecting on the price the religious quarrels in France had exacted on her productive power and prosperity.   The Elizabethan attention on nurturing and protecting commerce and national industry also attracted his attention. Montchrétien returned to France around 1610, (his return facilitated by the intervention of James I of England, who was a fan of his plays), convinced by the lessons he learnt in England.  He swiftly married a wealthy Norman widow, who helped him set up a steel foundry and hardware workshop (knives, principally) in Ousonne-sur-Loire and rent a warehouse in Paris, his principal market.  It was during this time that he set down to write his Traité de l'oeconomie politique (1615).  Besides coining the title of the new science, the Traité is also renowned for being one of the most articulate and subtle of Mercantilist tracts. Montchrétien's thesis is presented as a plea to King Louis XIII and his mother, the regent-queen Marie de Medici, to protect the commerce and elevate the national industries of France. Drawing loosely from his English observations and works of Jean Bodin, lays out a keen, articulate case, laying out the central features of mature Mercantilism, anticipating Thomas Mun by several years.  Montchrétien's Traité was well-received by Guillaume de Vair (keeper of the seals, i.e. minister of justice), who afforded him entry into the counsel of Louis XIII in 1617.  But it is probable that his advice proved irritating, as later that same year, we find Montchrétien appointed governor of Châtillon-sur-Loire and ennobled with the title of ""Seigneur de Vasteville"", conveniently getting him out of earshot of the monarch. The outbreak of Huguenot uprising of 1621 proved fatal.  Although Montchrétien was probably Catholic by faith (at least, there is no evidence otherwise), he nonetheless took up the side of the rebellion.  Why he did so is not particularly clear.  Nonetheless, Montchrétien strapped on his sword and set about raising armies in the Maine region and Lower Normandy, marching them in relief of the embattled Huguenot citadels.   But in October, 1621, at a hostelry near Tourailles, Montchrétien was ambushed and killed by Claude Turgot, Seigneur des Tourailles (of the same ancestral house that would later produce the great Jacques Turgot).  Deprived of a live rebel, the court at Domfort put Montchrétien's cadaver on makeshift trial, sentencing his bones to be smashed with iron, his corpse burnt and his ashes scattered. After his death, Montchrétien's name fell into obscurity.  His reputation was savaged by contemporaries, and slanderous allegations circulating accusing the rebel of being an apostate, a forger, a highwayman, and a myriad of other likely falsehoods.  Montchrétien's fallen reputation may help explain why his Traité was not as appreciated and influential upon later French economists as it probably should have been.

"Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu", 1689-1755. ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/montesquieu.htm," French Enlightenment political philosopher, essayist and social commentator.  Montesquieu was among the first to attempt to apply Newtonian analogies to political, social, economic and moral behavior. Conceived of the concepts of ""social laws"" and a natural ""social equilibrium"" as the balance of opposing forces, that were later taken up by the Physiocrats.   Charles Louis de Secondat was a wealthy aristocrat of Gascon extraction.  His family (unlike many other noble houses) was heavily involved in wine industry and commerce of Bordeaux and, although Catholics, had extensive connections with the Huguenot community (Montesquieu himself married a wealthy Huguenot heiress, Jeanne de Lartigue,  in 1715).  His father, Jacques de Secondat, Baron de La Brède, was of a cadet branch and carved a career as a mercenary, before his death in 1713..  Charles Louis inherited the baronial Montesquieu title (as well as massive estates and fortune) from his uncle, Jean-Baptiste de Montesquieu, who died in 1716. Trained in law, Charles-Louis received his degree at the University of Bordeaux in 1708, and went on to became an advocate in the parlement of Bordeaux, succeeding his uncle to its presidency in 1716.  But his early interests were in the natural sciences and literature, and he was an active participant in the provincial academies of sciences and belle lettres in Bordeaux.  Montesquieu broke into the literary world with his Lettres Persanes, published anonymously in Amsterdam in 1721.  It is a fictional travelogue of a pair of Persian visitors to France, describing the country, its inhabitants, mores and politics, including a critical exposition of John Law's system. It was well-received, and gave Montesequieu entry into the ""republic of letters"" in Paris, including the salon of the Marquise of Lambert and (possibly) also the celebrated Club d'Entresol, the stomping ground of early Enlightenment figures like the Abbé de Saint-Pierre and the Marquis d'Argenson. Montesqieu's 1725 Temple de Gnide, a satire inspired by the Parisian salons, was judged to be a bit too licentious at the time.  Montesquieu sold his office of the presidency of the Bordeaux parlement and invested the proceeds into his wine business. Montesquieu was elected to the Académie française in 1728. After delivering his discourse, Montesquieu decided to depart France for a long sojourn abroad.  Leaving behind his wife to run the the wine business,  Montesquieu traveled extensively around Europe for four years, from 1728 to 1731, studying their societies and political systems.  After returning to France, Montesquieu threw himself completely into literary work, and wrote a 1734 dissertation on rise and fall of ancient Rome. Immediately after, Montesquieu began composing what would become his best-known work, L'Ésprit des Loix (""Spirit of the Laws"").  Initiated in 1735, t would only finally appear in print a decade later, in 1748, in Geneva.  It is hard to call it finished - a roaming, disconnected collection of thoughts, L'Ésprit was far from a polished treatise. Montesqueu's L'Ésprit des Loix begins with a survey and classification of types of government.  He identifies three types of government -  republic (rule of a group, which ranges in scope from democracy to aristocracy), monarchy (rule of one, but according to fundamental laws) and despotism (rule of one according to whim).  But Montesquieu's interest is less about specific forms of government, but rather in the way they govern.  For instance, he notes each system has a different underlying principle of legitimacy, that is, a measure of whether the government is acting according to the system, and the basis for whether it is to be obeyed: ""virtue"" in republics, ""honor"" in monarchies and ""fear"" in despotisms.  But Montesquieu is most famous for for focusing attention on the ""separation of powers"".  He is the first to clearly identify three branches of government - the executive, the legislative and the judicial - and to posit that whether or not these powers are separated ultimately determines whether the resulting governments are moderate or despotic, regardless of their type.  Although he acknowledges that legislative power is probably most safely held in the hands of elected representatives, he emphasizes the importance of ensuring minorities are not overruled by majorities, and the critical role of the executive in keeping the legislatures in check. But Montesquieu's  L'Ésprit des Loix was not a political tract, but rather a scientific one. Although it is clear he has preferences,  he is not writing this to advocate political reform.  Rather, the point is to explain why certain countries have one kind of system, and other countries have another, why some have succeeded in separating powers, where others have failed.  The main ""scientific"" objective of L'Ésprit des Loix was to decipher the ultimate causes of ""liberty"", that is, to explain the political and legal systems of countries, the type and character of the government, by other factors.  Montesquieu did not single out a unique factor, but connected everything holistically - physical geography,  climate, size, location, quality of land, as well as civilizational factors, like manners, morals, religion, economy, extent of commerce, etc.  In Montesquieu's view, all these factors were important and all connected to each other.  In his grand survey, Montesquieu concluded that liberty was rare and fragile, that there was always a tendency towards tyranny.   He eschewed the notion of secular progress of civilization,  positing instead that it was circular, the civilizations rose and fell routinely, usually by chance events.  Improvements in technology, for instance, might improve a nation's prospects temporarily, but it also increased the power of government.  Unless there are ""checks and balances"" (Montesquieu's great adage), the tendency towards abuse of power and tyranny is almost unstoppable.  Montesquieu singled out wars as particularly destructive as they were usually accompanied by internal measures (e.g. concentration of powers, suspension of civil liberties, increased taxation, militarization of societies) which crushed the citizenry and cleared the way to absolutism.  Montesquieu ascribed the fall of Rome to its incessant wars, which undermined liberties, corrupted the government and impoverished society.  Contrary to Gibbon and other Enlightenment writers, Montesquieu believed Western Christianity was actually a tonic, given that the Christian church often operated in opposition to the secular state, and historically served as a check to fend off the despotism of Emperors and Kings.  He contrasts this with Roman paganism, Chinese Confucianism, and latter Inquisition days, where state and church were merged, and religion reinforced, rather than counter-balanced, the power of the State.  He viewed the emergence of Protestantism in the 16th Century, restoring an oppositional stance, in a positive light.  In his view, democratic republics were also not ideal - historical examples showed democracy was also prone to abuse and excesses and often led to tyranny.  The ideal type for Montesquieu was the moderate monarchy, of which example he has the Medieval Germanic monarchies with heavy checks and balances from other parts of society.  Liberty, Montesquieu asserted, flourishes from opposition.  Montesquieu was particularly enthralled by the example of England, which seemed to have been able to preserve its liberties, while the rest of Europe slipped into absolutist regimes.  He ascribes much of it to her geography - islands having a natural barrier, they are less susceptible to land wars and invasions from outside, thus allowing her to society to remain de-militarized, unfortified and her taxes relatively low.  Moreover, naval powers, he asserts, are less susceptible to military coups, which are almost invariably undertaken by generals rather than admirals.  Highland civilizations - like the Swiss - also enjoy natural protections, the citizenry being scattered across mountains are harder to subjugate than in open lowland civilizations.   Muddy, water-clogged marshes were the natural protections that preserved Venice, Holland and ancient Tyre.  But their commerce was also key.  Montesquieu believed trade and interdependence was an antidote to conflict and reduced the risk of war (although given the numerous Mercantilist-motivated wars of the time, this could be disputed).  More permanently, commerce led to the creation of a large middle class and civil society, which held on to local powers and demanded intermediate powers, forcing the separation which kept tyranny in check. The current differences between England and France, Montesquieu asserts, are thus primarily due to France's unfortunate geographical situation.  France's extensive land borders set it up for repeated, endless wars, and consequently fated France towards absolutism, corruption and impoverishment.  England's island status might not be replicable in France, but its eschewing of land wars, its extensive commerce, its large middle class, the delegation and preservation of local powers and a vigorous parliament keeping the central government in check, had also helped preserve its liberties, and could serve as a prototype for another nations. The L'Ésprit des Loix was a sensation, and a catalyst for the French Enlightenment which would flower in its aftermath.  But it was also severely criticized, particularly by church authorities, leading Montesquieu to compose his Défense (1750), which helped clarify and popularize the original treatise. Montesquieu would spend his remaining years revising and expanding upon L'Ésprit.  He died on February 10, 1755, of a pulmonary infection. D'Alembert composed an ""Éloge a Montesquieu"" to open the fifth volume of the Encyclopédie. Diderot had previously asked Montesquieu to contribute articles on democracy and political systems for the Encyclopédie, but Montesquieu, tired of the topic, had declined.  However, Montesquieu ended up writing one article, on taste (""goût""), completed by Voltaire, that came out posthumously in the seventh volume (1757).

Henry Ludwell Moore, 1869-1958.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/moore.htm,"  Maryland native Henry L. Moore had a relatively quiet career.  Moore was educated at Johns Hopkins, getting his B.A. in 1892 and his Ph.D in 1896.  As a graduate student, he spent a year (1894-5) at the University of Vienna, where he attended courses given by Carl Menger.   After a short stint as a lecturer at Johns Hopkins and Smith College, Moore joined the economics faculty at Columbia University in 1902, where he would remain for the remainder of his career.   Moore's early research on the Continental proto-marginalists von Thunen and Cournot inspired his interest in the Marginalist Revolution in general -- and the Lausanne School in particular.  As a young man, Moore traveled to Europe and met Leon Walras in 1903 (with whom he continued a correspondence), Pareto in 1908 and Bortkiewicz in 1912.    Self-educated in mathematics and statistics, Henry Moore gradually became interested in the empirical examination of Neoclassical economics.   His 1911 work used correlation analysis to empirically test the marginal productivity theory of distribution.   This was to be carried on by his student, Paul H. Douglas. In 1914, Moore jumped on board the business cycle wagon.  Moore argued that economic cycles were caused by fluctuations in commodity production, which, in turn, are driven by rhythms of climate change.  Moore identified a 8-year cycle on the basis of this.  However, to make this work, Moore had to introduce an upward-sloping demand curve for pig-iron -- for which he was roundly criticized.  A decade later, in his 1923 cycle book, this condition was replaced with a more acceptable one related to competition.  However, he then introduced an even wackier hypothesis, connecting the 8-year climate cycle to the position of the planet Venus.  Fellow economists giggled as astrologists got excited.   A critical component of Moore's analysis of cycles was his statistical estimation of demand and supply curves via least squares methods.  In this, Moore's work was much better received and he can be rightly regarded as one of the fathers of econometrics.  Moore's 1917 work employed such methods to forecast cotton yields.  This line of research was carried on by Moore's most faithful student and disciple, Henry Schultz. In a series of articles starting in 1925 and culminating in his Synthetic Economics (1929), Moore tried to connect business cycles and general equilibrium theory.  He did this simply by assuming that the statistically-fitted trends of economic time series were precisely the theoretical equilibrium values.  As statistical trends fluctuate over time, Moore modified the equilibrium equations of Walras's GE system, expressing them as ratios over trend and thus coming up with what he called a ""moving equilibrium"".   Moore then showed how the deep parameters of the Walrasian system (e.g. partial elasticities of demand and supply, production coefficients, etc.) could just be computed by statistically estimating them from the trend values of the variables. Although he never was quite successful in his estimation efforts, Henry Moore and his students at Columbia, notably Schultz and Douglas, accomplished much in pioneering empirical work that would influence later econometricians.

Thomas Moore, 1779-1852   ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/mooreco.htm," The following are a few satirical poems by Irish poet Thomas Moore on the subject of the Bullionist Controversy, Public Debt, the Corn Laws and other economic subjects of the day. Thomas Moore was one of the more revelrous poets of English Romantic era (1790s-1830s), composer of the orientalist epic poem ""Lalla Rookh"", translator of the ""Odes"" of Anacreon, and an early rival and then close friend, executor and biographer of Lord Byron. Although his stock has fallen somewhat since his day, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe considered him to be one of the three best living poets of that time (the other two being Lord Byron and Sir Walter Scott). Thomas Moore was a Catholic Irish activist, liberal Whig and close friend of Lord John Russell.  Thomas Moore was often quite provocative in political matters: for instance, his beautiful ""Irish Melodies"" are seeped in Irish nationalist lore, and his numerous tweaking satires on all sorts of traditional British mores and institutions, even when characteristically good-humored, still carry a sting. Unlike his literary brother, Thomas de Quincey, Thomas Moore was not an economist, but wrote several amusing pieces which touched on the economic debates of the day. Most of the poems reproduced here were originally written by Thomas Moore for The Times and published in his 1828 book, Cash, Corn and Catholics.  Economic debates in Britain at the time swirled around the Bullionist controversy, the National Debt and the Corn Laws, and Moore touches on many of the same topics that agitated contemporary Classical Ricardian economists. At the time, a Tory government was in power with Robert Banks Jenkinson, Earl of Liverpool as Prime Minister. Liverpool's economic guru was Frederick J. Robinson, who was appointed President of the Board of Trade in 1818, and became Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1823.  Moore refers to the former repeatedly as ""Jenky"" or ""Jenkin"" and to the latter as ""Freddy"" or ""Robin"".  Contents The early 1800s were the years of the great Bullionist Debate involving Ricardo, Thornton, Malthus, Torrens and others. At issue the proposed resumption of payment in specie (i.e. to legally force banks pay note bearers with gold bullion on demand).  In 1797, the threat of a French invasion had led to a run on the Bank of England and other banks. This prompted the government to suspend the requirement that banks to honor their notes on demand with payment in gold. During the remainder of the Napoleonic wars, this suspension continued -- partly because it facilitated government borrowing to pay for the war effort. Writers like Ricardo opposed the continuation of the suspension and argued for resumption of payment in specie.  They charged that, if suspension continued, banks would wildly issue notes far above their store of gold bullion, which would be inflationary.  The ""Amatory Colloquy"" between the Bank and the Government refers to the issue of resumption of payment in specie -- the Bank being outraged at the Government's requirement that payment be made in gold. The Bank notes that the Government itself had benefited from the suspension of payment as it was therefore able to borrow huge amounts from commercial banks.  Coutts was a prominent British bank. The ""Dialogue"" between the sovereign (a gold coin) and the banknote is also on this issue. Unbacked during the suspension, the female note feels abandoned by the roaming male gold coin; the male coin, in turns, feels the female note has been ""flirtatious"" with other precious metals. There is perhaps one too many puns (noted originally in italics by Moore) in this poem. ""Memorabilia of Last Week"" is an account of the budget debate in parliament. We leave it here, as opposed to the section on Public Debt, because of the reference to Bullionism in the end. As noted earlier, Frederick Robinson is the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Back BANK Is all then forgotten? those amourous pranks
You and I, in our youth, my dear Government, play'd;
When you call'd me the fondest, the truest of Banks,
And enjoy'd the endearing advances I made? When left to ourselves, unmolested and free,
To do all that a dashing young couple should do,
A law against paying was laid upon me,
But none against owing, dear helpmate, on you. And is it then vanish'd? -- that ""hour (as Othello
So happily calls it) of Love and Direction""?[1]
And must we, like other fond doves, my dear fellow,
grow good in our old age, and cut the connexion? GOVERNMENT Even so, my belov'd Mrs. Bank, it must be;

[2] Mr. Abercromby's statement of the enormous tavern bills of the Commissioners of Bankrupts. Back The ""Sinking Fund"" was created in 1717 by Sir Robert Walpole in which tax revenues were set aside to paying back the interest and the principal on government debt.  It was revived by William Pitt the Younger in 1780s, to handle the increasing public debt after the American war, and subsequently the French Revolutionary Wars.   Joseph Hume was a radical MP who, among other things, promoted the setting up of savings banks. Henry Brougham was the founder of the influential Whig journal, Edinburgh Review and a prominent liberal politician.  Of course, ""R-b-ns-n""  refers to Frederick J. Robinson (the contemporary Chancellor the Exchequer) and ""Jenky"" to Robert Banks Jenkinson (the Tory Prime Minister). ""All in a Family Way"" is a satire on the notion of the burden of the public debt. Moore clearly thinks the government debt is bad, and so plays on the ""all-in-the-family"" argument, made by British Tory politician, Sir Robert Peel.  ""Freddy"", once again, refers to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The ""Enigma"" is not too difficult to figure out: the riddler is the public debt, of course.  The ""Premier"" refers to Arthur Wellesely (Duke of Wellington), the war hero who defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, led the conservative Tory faction in parliament and later succeeded Liverpool as Prime Minister in 1828. ""The Periwinkles and the Locusts"" is taken from a passage in Rabelais (Book III, Ch. 2) and refers, again, to the unsustainability of public debt (incidentally, the subsequent debate in Rabelais between Panurge on Pantagruel on the merits of debt are very much worth reading on their own). The country is essentially run on debt on the promise of Periwinkle revenue - but when the books are laid open, not only is there little revenue, but the Locusts (i.e. the Lords) have taken much of what there was. Moore's note on the expensive feeding of the Locusts refers to the Corn Laws - which are more extensively discussed below.  The Laird of Salmagundi is, of course, Wellesley. His later ""Translation from the Gull Language"" describes how the public debt prevented English military intervention abroad (probably in reference to Greece, who had recently been struggling in their war of independence against the Ottoman Turks. cf. with the ""Ghost of Miltiades"" below.)

I heard them say,
And they cheer'd and shouted all the way,
As the Laird of Salmagundi went,
To open in state his Parliament. The Salmagundians once were rich,
Or thought they were -- no matter which --
For every year, the Revenue[1]
From their Periwinkles larger grew;
And their rulers, skill'd in all the trick
And legerdemain of arithmetic,
Knew how to place 1, 2, 3, 4
5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 and 10,
Such various ways, behind, before,
That they made a unit seem a score,
And prov'd themselves most wealthy men!

The people wise, the ruler clever --
And God help those, like me and you,

That the Periwinkle Revenue
Would thus go flourishing on for ever. ""Hurra! hurra!"" I heard them say,
And they cheer'd and shouted all the way,
As the Great Panurge in glory went
To open his own dear Parliament. But folks at length began to doubt
What all this conjuring was about;
For, every day, more deep in debt
They saw their wealthy rulers get: --
""Let's look (said they) the items through,
And see if what we're told be true
Of our Periwinkle Revenue.""
But, Lord! they found there wasn't a tittle
Of truth in aught they heard before;
For, they gain'd by Periwinkles little,
And lost by Locusts ten times more!
These Locusts are a lordly breed
Some Salmagundians love to feed.
Of all the beasts that ever were born,
Your Locust most delights in corn;
And though his body be but small,
To fatten him takes the devil and all!
""Oh fie! oh fie!"" was now the cry,

And the Laird of Salmagundi went
To open his Locust Parliament! (Thomas Moore, 1827) Notes: [1] Accented as in Swift's line - ""Not so a nation's revenues are paid."" Back [Scripta manet] 'Twas grav'd on the Stone of Destiny,[1]
In letters four, and letters three;
And ne'er did the King of the Gulls go by

The ancient race of the Gulls should ne'er
One hour of peace or plenty share.""
But years and years successive flew
And the letters still more legible grew, --
At top, a T, an H, an E,
And underneath, D. E. B. T. Some thought them Hebrew, -- such as Jews,
More skill'd in Scrip than Scripture use;
While some surmis'd 'twas an ancient way
Of keeping accounts, (well known in the day
Of the fam'd Didlerius Jeremias,
Who had thereto a wonderful bias,)
And prov'd in books most learnedly boring,
'Twas called the Pontick way of scoring.

'Tis freedom's fight, and on the field
Where I expire, your doom is seal'd.""

He hath summon'd his Peers and Patriots all,
And he asks, ""Ye noble Gulls, shall we
Stand basely by at the fall of the Free,
Nor utter a curse, nor deal a blow?""

But, -- why do they rest suspended there?
What sudden blight, what baleful charm,
Hath chill'd each eye and check'd each arm?
Alas! some withering hand hath thrown
The veil from off that fatal stone,
And pointing now, with sapless finger,
Showeth where dark those letters linger, --
Letters four, and letters three,
T.H.E. D.E.B.T. At sight thereof, each lifted brand
Powerless falls from every hand;
In vain the Patriot knits his brow, --
Even talk, his staple, fails him now.
In vain the King like a hero treads,
His Lords of the Treasury shake their heads;
And to all his talk of ""brave and free"",
No answer getteth His Majesty
But ""T.H.E. D.E.B.T."" In short, the whole Gull nation feels
They're fairly spell-bound, neck and heels;
And so, in the face of the laughing world,
Must e'en sit down, with banners furled,
Adjourning all their dreams sublime
Of glory and war to -- some other time. (Thomas Moore, 1833) Notes: [1] Linfail, or the Stone of Destiny, -- for which, see Westminster Abbey. Back The "" Corn Laws"" were instituted in 1815 by the British parliament prohibiting the import of corn (i.e. a generic British term for small grains like wheat, oats, barley, etc.) until the home price became eighty shillings a quarter. A more flexible set of Corn Laws were instituted in 1828 with a sliding scale of import duties rather than outright prohibition. This price-support scheme at a rather high level had benefited the landed gentry tremendously by assuring them a steady, artificially-inflated income from their lands.  Rallied against the Corn Laws were the populations in the cities, faced with higher food costs, and, consequently, industrial manufacturers, faced with higher wage bills. Some of them organized themselves into a ""free trade"" movement for the repeal of the Corn Laws. However, the British government, in particular the House of Lords, was dominated by landlords and gentlemen and thus defended the Corn Laws assiduously. Paradoxically, it was the Corn Laws that propelled David Ricardo, himself a landlord, into theoretical economics in order to set up the basis for an argument for its repeal. In contrast, his poorer friend Thomas Malthus was a defender of the laws. It seems throughout that Moore himself was against the Corn Laws - even though he parodied his own interest in it (cf. ""Corn and Catholics"" below). The poem ""Cotton to Corn: A dialogue"" is self-evident. Cotton manufacturers want the Corn Laws repealed to enable corn-exporting countries to pay for British cloth exports. References are also made to the mechanical advances of the industrial revolution -- to the Spinning Jenny and to Richard Arkwright, textile manufacturer and inventor of the water-frame. ""An Expostulation to Lord King"", refers to a proceedings in the House of Lords when a particular Lord King was reprimanded by other Peers for having ""made so many speeches against the Corn Laws"".  In the process, Lord King brought several petitions against the Corn Laws by various groups, such as weavers and shoemakers, to the attention of Parliament.  ""No bread and the treadmill"" refers to the workhouse, the horrible 19th Century way of dealing with the hungry and unemployed throughout Britain. ""Ode to the Goddess Ceres"" takes a satirical swipe at the landed interests behind the Corn Laws - with Moore taking on the role of Sir Th-m-s L-thbr-e, a landed gentleman in the House of Lords. Ceres, recall, is the Graeco-Roman goddess of earth and harvest. ""B-nth-m"", naturally, is Jeremy Bentham, the ""philosophical radical"" of whom, it seems, Moore was never fond. The two M--lls are James Mill and his son John Stuart Mill, both of them Ricardian economists and Benthamite reformers.  His reference to an ""war on all breeding whatever"" refers to J.S. Mill's advocacy of contraception. ""The Donkey and his Panniers"" is an interesting fable. The Donkey is obviously the British economy while the ""panniers"", we suspect, are the ""Corn Laws"" by which the Donkey is burdened and collapses. Note the reference to the General Glut Controversy when one of the donkey's drivers figures he collapsed due to an ""overproduction of thistles"". Note also that Moore alleges that the Bullionist Resumption Act is not the cure either.  Nor, in his mind, does he think that the post-war depression Britain fell into was merely a natural outcome of the ""transition to peace"". It takes the passerby to note that, first of all, one needs to remove the panniers (i.e. repeal the Corn Laws). ""Corn and Catholics"" is a partly self- directed jab regarding the two hotly-debated issues of the day: the repeal of the Corn Laws and the Catholic Emancipation Act, both of which Moore supported and wrote much about. Alternatively, it could be interpreted as a parody against British apathy to the Corn Laws and the Catholic situation. Back Said Cotton to Corn, t'other day,
As they met and exchang'd salute--
(Squire Corn in his carriage so gay,
Poor Cotton, half famish'd on foot): ""Great Squire, if it isn't uncivil
To hint at starvation before you,
Look down on a poor hungry devil,
And give him some bread, I implore you!"" Quoth Corn, then, in answer to Cotton,
Perceiving he meant to make free --
""Low fellow, you've surely forgotten
The distance between you and me! To expect that we, Peers of high birth,
Should waste our illustrious acres,
For no other purpose on earth
Than to fatten curst calico-makers! -- That Biships to hobbins should bend --
Should stoop from their Bench's sublimity,
Great dealers in lawn, to befriend
Such contemptible dealers in dimity! ""No -- vile Manufacture! ne'er harbour
A hope to be fed at our boards; --
Base offspring of Arkwright the barber,
What claim canst thou have upon Lords? ""No -- thanks to the taxes and debt,
And the triumph of paper o'er guineas,
Our race of Lord Jemmys, as yet,
May defy your whole rabble of Jennys!"" So saying -- whip, crack and away
Went Corn in his chaise through the throng,
So headlong, I heard them all say,
""Squire Corn would be down, before long."" (Thomas Moore, 1826) Back (""Quem das dinem, Rex magne, laborum?"" - Virgil) How can you, my Lord, thus delight to torment all

On a question, my Lord, there's so much to abhor in?
A question - like asking one, ""How is your wife?"" --
At once so confounded domestic and foreign. As to weavers, no matter how poorly they feast;

You may always conclude that Lord L-d-d-le's joking! And then, those unfortunate weavers of Perth -
Not to know the vast difference Providence dooms
Between weavers of Perth and Peers of high birth,
'Twixt those who have heir-looms, and those who've but looms! ""To talk now of starving!"" - as great Ath-l said --[3]
(and nobles all cheer'd, and the bishops all wonder'd,)
""When, some years ago, he and others had fed
Of these same hungry devils about fifteen hundred!"" It follows from hence - and the Duke's very words
Should be publish'd wherever poor rogues of this craft are --
That weavers, once rescued from starving by Lords,
Are bound to be starved by said Lords ever after. When Rome was uproarious, her knowing patricians
Made ""Bread and the Circus"" a cure for each row;
But not so the plan of our noble physicians,
""No Bread and the Tread-mill"" 's the regimen now. So cease, my dear Baron of Ockham, your prose,
As I shall my poetry -- neither convinces;
And all we have spoken and written but show,
When you tread on a nobleman's corn, how he winces.[4] (Thomas Moore, 1826) Notes: [1] See the proceedings of Lords, Wednesday, March 1, 1826, when Lord King was severely reproved by several of the noble Peers, for making so many speeches against the Corn Laws. [2] The noble Earl said that ""when he heard the petition came from ladies' boot and shoe-makers, he thought it must be against the ""corns"" which they inflicted on the fair sex"". [3] The Duke of Athol said that ""at a former period, when these weavers were in great distress, the landed interest of Perth had supported 1500 of them. It was a poor return for these very men now to petition against the persons who had fed them"". [4] An improvement, we flatter ourselves, on Lord L.'s joke.

That with our meals our slumbers mix --
That spoil our tempers and digestions --
Eternal Corn and Catholics! Gods! were there ever two such bores?
Nothing else talk'd of night or morn --
Nothing in doors, or out of doors,
But endless Catholics and Corn! Never was such a brace of pests --
While Ministers, still worse than either,
Skill'd but in feathering their nests,
Plague us with both, and settle neither. So addled in my cranium meet
Popery and Corn, that oft I doubt,
Whether this year, 'twas bonded Wheat
Or bonded Papists, they let out. Here, landlords, here, polemics nail you,
Arm'd with all rubbish they can rake up;
Prices and Texts at once assail you --
From Daniel these, and those from Jacob.[1] And when you sleep, with head still torn
Between the two, their shapes you mix,
Till sometimes Catholics seem Corn --
Then Corn again seems Catholics. Now, Dantzic wheat before you floats --

Back The first poem, ""An Incantation: Sung by the Bubble Spirit"" is probably about the sustainability of public debt and thus might properly be grouped with the earlier ones. However, it can also be seen as speculative bubbles in general, thus we keep it separate. ""The Ghost of Miltiades"" is about Greek war bonds. As noted earlier, Greece had been fighting for independence  from the Ottoman Turks since 1821.  In 1824-5, the fledgling Greek government obtained two large, high-interest from English banks, which were then turned and floated as bonds on the London market.  Andreas Luriottis was the Greek agent in London.  The whole thing did not end well and the value of the Greek bonds collapsed accordingly -- ending with the ""Benthamite"" trader wailing about his subsequent losses and trying to sell them back to the Greeks. ""Jerry"" is Jeremy Bentham, of course. The last poem, ""Ode to the Sublime Porte"", is not about economics at all, but an all-too-Moore-like jab at some female friend of his, a confirmed ""Benthamite"" who tiresomely raves endlessly on about the articles in the ""Westminster Review"". Consequently, he petitions the Sultan for her death by being sown up in a sack and thrown into the ocean (the legendary Ottoman treatment of unwanted harem women) -- albeit with the review tied around her neck. The articles in one copy of the Benthamite journal are read out, which, apparently, include James Mill on the General Glut Controversy.   I have no idea who Mr. ""Fun-Blank"" is (possibly Edwin Chadwick).  The ""celebrated political tailor"" is  Francis Place. ""Old Jeremy"" is obviously Bentham himself. The young Mr. M--- is John Stuart Mill.  [It might be useful to compare this poem with Moore's ""Blue Love-Song"" and ""Proposals for a Gynaecocracy"" for some of his not-so-gracious-but-still-amusing thoughts on females in politics and intellectual affairs.] Back [Air: Come with me, and we will go,

And he said, in a voice, that thrill'd the frame,
""If ever the sound of Marathon's name
Hath fir'd they blood or flush'd thy brow,
Lover of Liberty, rise thee now!"" The Benthamite, yawning, left his bed --
Away to the Stock Exchange he sped,
And he found the Scrip of Greece so high,
That it fir'd his blood, it flush'd his eye,
And oh, 'twas a sight to see,
For never was Greek more Greek than he!
And still as the premium higher went,
His ecstas rose - so much per cent.,
(As we see in a glass, that tells the weather,
The heat and the silver rise together,)
And Liberty sung from the patriot's lip,
While a voice from pocket whisper'd ""Scrip!""
The Ghost of Miltiades came again; --
He smil'd as the pale moon smiles through rain,
For his soul was glad at the patriot strain;
(And poor, dear ghost -- how little he knew
The jobs and the tricks of the Philhellene crew!)
""Blessings and thanks!"" was all he said,
Then, melting away, like a night-dream, fled! The Benthamite hears -- amaz'd that ghosts
Could be such fools -- and away he posts,
A patriot still? Ah no, ah no --
Goddess of Freedom, thy scrip is low,
And, warm and fond as they lovers are,
Thou triest their passion, when under par.
The Benthamite's ardour fast decays,
By turns he weeps, and swears, and prays,
And wishes the d--l had Crescent and Cross,
Ere he had been forc'd to sell at a loss.
They quote him the Stock of various nations,
But, spite of his classical associations,
Lord how he loathes the Greek quotations! ""Who'll buy my Scrip! Who'll buy my Scrip?""
Is now the theme of the patriot's lip,
And he runs to tell how hard his lot is
To Messrs. Orlando and Luriottis,
And says, ""Oh Greece, for Liberty's sake,
Do buy my Scrip and I vow to break
Those dark, unholy bonds of thine --
If you'll only consent to buy up mine!""
The Ghost of Miltiades came once more; --
His brow, like the night, was lowering o'er,
And he said, with a look that flash'd dismay,
""Of Liberty's foes the worst are they
Who turn to a trade her cause divine,
And gamble for gold on Freedom's shrine!""

Sir Thomas More, 1478-1535.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/more.htm," Famed English humanist philosopher, lawyer and politician.   Oxford-educated Thomas More was a good friend of Erasmus of Rotterdam and collaborated on the general humanist project to revamp Catholic learning and theology in the light of the classical rationalism revived by the Renaissance, while simultaneously fighting the schismatic tendencies of the radical Reformation.  In 1516, More published his most famous work, Utopia (literally ""no place""), a description of an imaginary communistic society.  Private property is condemned and absent in Utopia, thus More's work can be seen as a prelude to early socialist literature. Thomas More served as personal counselor to King Henry VIII from 1517 and, after the fall of Cardinal Wolsey, More was appointed Lord Chancellor in late 1529 (the first time a non-cleric held that position).  During which he distinguished himself as a proponent of the English alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and a vigorous persecutor of the Lutheran heresy.  While More was notionally in charge of securing the king's divorce from Catherine of Aragon (Charles V's niece), he disliked the tactic of placing pressure on the church's privileges in England and eventually resigned in 1532.  In 1535, More refused to swear an oath to the Act of Succession breaking the English church from the Roman Catholic Church.  He was arrested for treason and subsequently beheaded.  The Catholic Church has since canonized Thomas More as a saint.      Major Works of Sir Thomas More     Resources on Sir Thomas More All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Abbé Andre Morellet, 1727-1819 ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/morellet.htm," French Enlightenment cleric, philosophe and wit and member of the prestigious Academie des Sciences.  The Abbé André Morellet (or l'abbé mord-les, as Voltaire called him) was a close admirer and disciple of Vincent de Gournay and Jacques Turgot. He criticized the French indies company in his 1760 treatise, provoking a response from Neo-Colbertiste Jacques Necker, and a subsequent rejoinder.  In his 1770, Refutation, Morellet defended the (Turgotian) version of Physiocracy against the attacks of  Galiani and  Diderot.  He took up the defense against Linguet's assault in his 1775 Paradoxe and criticized the work of Necker in his 1775 Analyse  But he was not personally friendly with the Physiocrats.  Unlike his fellow traveller, Condorcet, Morellet miraculously survived the Revolution, despite of his brave, public attacks on the Directorate and the Terror.  He also translated the works of Beccaria. The Abbé Morellet was elected to the prestigious Académie française in 1785.

Morelly, ?-?,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/morelly.htm,"Not to be confused with Abbe Morellet, Morelly was a mysterious Enlightenment-era French writer about which very little is known. In his famous utopian poem the Basiliad, Morelly outlined the rudiments of his communistic vision of society, which he followed upon by a more elaborate defense in his Code de la nature.  Morelly identified the ""desire of ownership"" (i.e. private property) as the source of all evil and crime. Argued that in a communistic society, with centrally-regulated distribution of goods -- every man contributing according to his ability and receiving according to his need.--  evil as such would be eradicated and natural man would emerge.  Morelly's work echoes the contemporary contributions of Rousseau, who's most famous work was published around the same time.  But Morelly is far more radical. Morelly is suspected by some to be an alternative ego and pen-name of Diderot himself.    He has been variously identified as a régent in Vitry-le-François, and referred to (possibly erroneously) as Etienne-Gabriel Morelly, son of a civil servant of that same town, who's father may have been responsible for the first few works attributed to him.

Oskar Morgenstern, 1902-1977.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/morgenstern.htm," Oskar Morgenstern was groomed in the Austrian tradition, but was considerably less dogmatic in his tastes.  Succeeding Hayek in 1931 as director of the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle research, Morgenstern's research interests were not in the Hayekian monetary overinvestment theory, but rather in speculation and economic prediction (the subject of his 1928 habilitation thesis).  A professor at the University of Vienna in 1935, Morgenstern was also an active participant in Karl Menger's Vienna Colloquium and employed Abraham Wald in his institute.   He was also one of the great critics of the Austrian theory of capital, helping to bury the notion of the ""average period of production"". Morgenstern's 1935 article on the difficulties of perfect foresight, which stemmed partly from his Austrian training, and the greater generality of ""strategic behavior"" over ""robinson-crusoe"", price-taking behavior, led the mathematician Edward Cech to put him in touch with John von Neumann's 1928 article on games.     After Morgenstern was dismissed by the Nazis in 1938, he moved on to Princeton, where he finally met von Neumann.  Together, Morgenstern and John von Neumann wrote their famous treatise on the theory of games (1944), which not only launched  game theory but also the theory of choice under uncertainty. Morgenstern provided much of the economic analysis in that book. Morgenstern continued working on a variety of themes, notably a reworking of the von Neumann multi-sector growth model (with Kemeny and Thompson, 1956, 1976), on national defense (1959), on economic data (1950) and on finance, notably the testing of the emerging random walk hypothesis (with Granger, 1970).

Michio Morishima, 1923-2004,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/morishima.htm," Japanese Neo-Walarasian economist, initially at Osaka, and from 1970 at the L.S.E..  Although never quite abandoning his Neo-Walrasian roots, Morishima remains one of the most enthusiastic proponents of John von Neumann's 1937 model of an expanding economy. As a result, Morishima has spent much of his career exploring the von Neumann model and translating existing economic theory (notably, that of Ricardo, Marx, Walras and Hicks) into those terms.   Morishima has been influential also in various other aspects of Neo-Walrasian theory - notably, in linear production theory, stability theory, capital theory (to which he contributed a turnpike theorem) and the theory of demand  in all of which he has made landmark contributions. It his hard to choose among his various remarkable treatises which can be considered his magnum opus (he tends to announce that each new book is it), but perhaps his Equilibrium, Stability and Growth (1964) has been the most influential on Neo-Walrasian economics. Morishima was also a protagonist in the revival of interest in Classical Ricardian System.  He was involved in the Cambridge Capital Controversy of the 1960s and the Marxian debate over the ""transformation problem"". The ever-eclectic Morishima has also written several examinations of the historical, social and economic conditions of Japan and the world at large.

Bernard Moses obtained his B.A. from the University of Michigan in 1870, and, like many Americans at the time, took a graduate tour of  Germany, eventually earning his Ph.D. from Heidelberg in 1873, before returning to the United States. . After a brief stint at Alboin, Bernard Moses was hired by the University of California Berkeley in 1876, at a particularly chaotic period in the fledgling university's history.  Its president, Daniel Coit Gilman, had departed the previous year, due to entanglements with the politics of California state legislature.  Newly-minted Moses was brought in to essentially  take over all the social science classes abandoned with Gilman's departure.  Bernard Moses taught all the economics, history and jurisprudence courses at Berkeley almost single-handedly for the next fifteen years.  For his economics courses, Moses relied on an eclectic mix of Perry, Fawcett and Cossa for texts.  Moses founded the short-lived Berkeley Quarterly in 1880, and carved out the Department of History and Political Science in 1882. Although never made university president, Bernard Moses was arguably the most prominent faculty member at Berkeley, and shepherded economics and the social sciences through the political storms that frequently battered Berkeley from the 1870s through the end of the 1890s. Moses was gradually relieved of economics classes by the hiring of new faculty (notably Carl Plehn in 1892), allowing Moses to specialize more in economic history. Moses became a pre-eminent authority on the history of imperial Spain and Latin America..  When the Department of Economics was separated in 1902 under A.C. Miller, Moses remaining a strong and influential presence.  Moses was vital in giving early Berkeley economics its historicist-institutionalist tinge. Moses retired in 1911.

Thomas Mun, 1571-1641.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/mun.htm,"East India Company official who is perhaps most identified with ""the"" founder of traditional English Mercantilism. The grandson of a mint engraver and the son of a mercer, Thomas Mun lost his father early and was brought up his step-father, a wealthy East India trader.  After serving an apprenticeship in his step-father's business, Mun carved a career as an overseas merchant in the Levantine trade, traveling overseas for extended periods.  In 1615, Mun was elected as a director of the East India Company.  In the early 1620s, Mun took up the defense of the EIC against the restrictions advocated by Milles and Malynes that had recently been taken up by an angry English parliament.  Mun's defense was first articulated in a tract published in 1621, and then further elaborated in a presentation before Parliament in 1628, which culminated in his principal mature piece, England's Treasure by Forraign Trade, written c.1630 but only published posthumously by his son John Mun in 1664.  Mun summarizes his formula in the famous opening to chapter 2 of the latter pamphlet. ""Although a Kingdom may be enriched by gifts received, or by purchase taken from some other Nations, yet these are things uncertain and of small consideration. The ordinary means therefore to encrease our wealth and treasure is by Forraign Trade, wherein wee must ever observe this rule: to sell more to strangers yearly than wee consume of theirs in value.""  (1664: ch.2) Like Misselden, Mun explained that it was the trade balance of a nation as a whole, and not the individual activities of any particular trading companies, that determine whether gold and silver flows in or out of a nation.  The objective of economic policy, Mun argued, was ""to sell more to strangers yearly than we consume of theirs in value"" to induce an influx of precious metal.   He proposed that government strive to keep a favorable trade balance by promoting exports and restricting imports by a variety of means.  Mun bewails the short-sighted bullionist restrictions on the export of precious metals - noting that trading companies need to export cash in order to conduct their trading activities overseas, which will brings in more cash in the end.  Companies need cash to buy wares in foreign markets which they can re-export to other foreign markets for even greater value, and thus has the overall result in a net influx of treasure into England.  He uses the example of a company taking £100,000 is silver cash to buy Asian wares, which after transshipment via English warehouses, will be sold in Spain or Italy for £200,000. ""Money begets trade, and trade encreaseth money"". The best government policy, Mun argued, would be to promote devaluation and assist the charter companies (who, as importers of raw materials and exporters of more valuable finished goods. were instrumental in inducing an influx).  However, Mun doubted that rising prices was a good policy.  In his new doctrines, Thomas Mun was anticipated by the Neapolitan Antonio Serra (1613) and the Frenchman Montchretien (1615.)  John Ramsay McCulloch speculated that there was an earlier edition of Mun's work, written and published in 1609, but a copy has never materialized.

John F.Nash, 1928-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/nash.htm," When the 21-year old John Forbes Nash, Jr wrote his 27-page dissertation outlining his ""Nash Equilibrium"" for strategic non-cooperative games, the impact was enormous. On the formal side, his existence proof was one of the first applications of Kakutani's fixed-point theorem later employed with so much gusto by Neo-Walrasians everywhere; on the conceptual side, he spawned much of the literature on non-cooperative game theory which has since grown at a prodigious rate - threatening, some claim, to overwhelm much of economics itself. When the young Nash had applied to graduate school at Princeton in 1948, his old Carnegie Tech professor, R.J. Duffin, wrote only one line on his letter of recommendation: ""This man is a genius"". It was at Princeton that Nash encountered the theory of games, then recently launched by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern. However, they had only managed to solve non-cooperative games in the case of ""pure rivalries"" (i.e. zero-sum). The young Nash turned to rivalries with mutual gain. His trick was the use of best-response functions and a recent theorem that had just emerged - Kakutani's fixed point-theorem. His main result, the ""Nash Equilibrium"", was published in 1950 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. He followed this up with a paper which introduced yet another solution concept - this time for two-person cooperative games - the ""Nash Bargaining Solution"" (NBS) in 1950. A 1951 paper attached his name to yet another side of economics - this time, the ""Nash Programme"", reflecting his methodological call for the reduction of all cooperative games into a non-cooperative framework. His contributions to mathematics were no less remarkable. As an undergraduate, he had inadvertently (and independently) proved Brouwer's fixed point theorem. Later on, he went on to break one of Riemann's most perplexing mathematical conundrums. From then on, Nash provided breakthrough after breakthrough in mathematics. In 1958, on the threshold of his career, Nash got struck by paranoid schizophrenia. He lost his job at M.I.T. in 1959 (he had been tenured there in 1958 - at the age of 29) and was virtually incapicated by the disease for the next two decades or so. He roamed about Europe and America, finally, returning to Princeton where he became a sad, ghostly character on the campus - ""the Phantom of Fine Hall"" as Rebecca Goldstein described him in her novel, Mind-Body Problem. The disease began to evaporate in the early 1970s and Nash began to gradually to return to his work in mathematics. However, Nash himself associated his madness with his living on an ""ultralogical"" plane, ""breathing air too rare"" for most mortals, and if being ""cured"" meant he could no longer do any original work at that level, then, Nash argued, a remission might not be worthwhile in the end.  As John Dryden once put it: Great wits are sure to madness near allied,
And thin partitions do their bounds divide. (John Dryden, Absalom and Achitophel, 1681) Nash shared the Nobel prize in 1994 with John C. Harsanyi and Reinhard Selten - for what he claims was his ""most trivial work""!      Major Works of John F. Nash     Resources on John Nash   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Martin de Azpilcueta (Navarrus), 1493-1586.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/navarrus.htm," Martin de Azpilgueta (also known as ""Doctor Navarrus"") was a Spanish Dominican priest and leading legal scholar of the Salamanca School.  He studied at Cahors and Toulouse (although Navarrus left before Jean Bodin arrived there).  Navarrus was appointed as professor of civil and canon law at the university of Salamanca.  From 1538, he taught at Coimbra and became a personal counsellor to the King of Portugal.  Navarrus principal economic work is his Comentario (1556) where Navarrus explicitly denounced price controls and defended money-changing and usury. Independently of his Toulouse schoolmate Jean Bodin, Navarrus is considered an independent discoverer of the Quantity Theory of Money . As he wrote, ""Other things being equal in countries where there is a great scarcity of money, all other saleable goods, and even the hands and labor of men, are given for less money than where it is abundant.""  Navarrus extended this to a more general scarcity theory of value, arguing that ""all merchandise becomes dearer when it is in strong demand and short supply"".  Navarrus served on a papal commission assembled in 1568 that resulted in a famous bull by Pope Paul V, Cum Unas, characterizing personal annuities as usurius.  However, Navarrus' subsequent ""clarifications"" of the bull took out much of its force, noting how it contained several loopholes that allowed redeemable forms of annuities (a point Toledo and the Jesuits ran with in 1571)   However, Navarrus's principal effort was in justifying interest achieved by bills of exchange, a growing practice in Mediterranean commerce.  Pope Pius V, in his 1571 bull In Eam, had condemned exchange banking as usurious, but Navarrus commentaries again opened up loopholes.

Henri Navier, 1785-1836.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/navier.htm," French engineer, mathematician and economist. Claude Louis Marie Henri Navier is a towering figure in engineering history, considered the father of structural analysis.  His importance in economics lies in his development of cost-benefit analysis, as a predecessor of Jules Dupuit.  Originating from Dijon, Burgundy, Henri Navier graduated from the École Polytechnique in 1804 and the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées in 1806.  While following a successful career as a civil engineer, Henri Navier remained involved as a teacher at the ENPC, becoming full professor by 1830.  Navier was a mentor for a critical generation of engineer-economists (notably Dupuit). Navier's principal contribution to economics is his 1830 article on the evaluation of public works (roads, bridges, etc.)   In typical engineering fashion,  public works were traditionally evaluated in terms of their costs to produce, and choice of projects ranked accordingly.  For example, if there are two possible routes to lay a road from Paris to Lille, then the route chosen will be the one that is costs less to produce. However, Navier pointed out this was evidently unsatisfactory for public works, where the objective was not to benefit the producer (the government), but rather to benefit the community at large.  Appealing to the cost-oriented classical economics, Navier proposed to measure the benefit to the community in terms of ""costs saved"" by consumers.  A particular route might be more expensive to build than another, but it might lower transportation costs to users of the road by more.  Navier proposed a decision rule that projects should only be undertaken if the total community benefit exceeded total recurring costs, e.g. if annual cost savings to users of a road exceeded the interest on capital plus maintenance costs of the road. Navier's method of cost-benefit analysis was the starting point of  Dupuit's 1844 breakthrough paper.  In particular, Dupuit made two important corrections. He first criticized Navier's narrow focus on transportation costs to measure cost savings, noting that there were other types of savings that need to be included (e.g. access to new sources of cheaper raw materials).  Dupuit's second point was more revolutionary: Navier had recognized that cheaper transportation costs not only benefited existing traffic, but might induce an increased volume of traffic. Navier proposed to measure the total benefits by applying the same costs per unit saved by old traffic to estimate the costs saved by the new traffic. Dupuit noted that this was an error that led to overestimation - as evidently the new traffic did not think it worthwhile to travel before, so they are not saving the same costs per unit as the old traffic.  From this kernel, Dupuit went onto propose to calculate consumers' surplus instead.       Major Works of Henri Navier   Resources on Henri Navier All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Jacques Necker, 1732-1804  ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/necker.htm," French Enlightenment economist, Neo-Colbertiste and minister of finance. The Geneva-born Jacques Necker started off as a clerk in a Swiss bank of Issac Vernet at the age of 15 and worked his way to the top quickly.  In 1750, Necker moved to bank's Paris branch and, by 1762, was made a partner. As a result of his speculative activities, by 1765, Necker a very wealthy man and the sole director of the bank.  Necker became gradually involved in public affairs.  Necker made numerous loans to the French government, was appointed minister for Geneva in Paris and sat on the board of directors of the French Compagnie des Indes (which, in 1769, he vainly defended from the attacks of the Abbé Morellet).   In 1772, Necker retired from the bank and began writing his ideas on contemporary economic and financial topics.  A Neo-Colbertiste, Necker was opposed to the Physiocrats.  He was particularly (and very personally) antagonistic to Morellet and his master, Jacques Turgot.  In 1773, Necker laid out his defense of State corporatism in a ""eulogy"" to Colbert, an essay that was crowned by the French Academy.  His 1775 tract attacked Turgot's plan for free trade in grains.   After Turgot was dismissed from government in 1776, Necker replaced him as director-general of finances, effectively the French minister of finance for King Louis XVI (Necker could not hold the formal title of comptroller-general (contrôleur général) because he was a Protestant and a foreigner).  Necker quickly reversed most of Turgot's famous edicts. Following a policy of borrowing rather than raising taxes to finance state expenditures (then exploding because of the American Revolutionary war), Necker earned a good degree of popularity among the people of France.  His push for the creation of new provincial assemblies were well-received by commoners, but earned him enemies in the court and parlements.   However, Necker's short-term, high-interest loans pushed the government closer to bankruptcy.  Jacques Necker's reputation as a financial ""genius"" came with his famous 1781 Compte Rendu report where, by manipulating the figures, he made it appear that French crown finances were not in crisis, but in fact enjoying a surplus.  He did this by restricting his report to ""ordinary"" revenues and expenditures paid in and out of the French Treasury (Trésor Royal), calculating a budget surplus of 10.2 million livres.  Necker concealed most war-related costs, assigning them to ""extraordinary"" expenditures (which he did not publish), and omitted mention of new government borrowing to finance the yawning budget deficit. Necker's credited the surplus to the reforms of the bureaucracy made under his tenure. Necker's optimistic report was severely criticized by contemporaries - his successors would calculate the true budget to be a deficit of 70m livres. By piercing the veil of secrecy surrounding crown finances at the time, the Comte Rendu, was a sensational best-seller and rocketed Necker to sky-high popularity.  But inside the royal court,  already sore at Necker's belated attempts to curtail spending, the reception was different. Many felt it was unseemly for Necker to publicly share the details of the crown's accounts with common people.   Like so many finance ministers before him, Necker soon found himself isolated and unable to push his more serious financial reforms through.  Louis XVI dismissed Necker in May 1781, a mere four months after the report, replacing him with Joly de Fleury. (a collection of evaluations of Necker's administration were re-printed in a 1781 Collection complette; most were largely negative, many from financiers, harping on Necker's foreignness, his accumulated fortune and unflatteringly comparing him with John Law) Although courted by Austria and Russia, Necker preferred to remain in the wilderness.  Necker wrote his famous Traité (1784), one of his better treatises.  In the meantime, Necker's successor, Alexandre de Calonne, had realized the truly desperate condition of French state finances and tried to reinstate some of Turgot's old reforms, which were greeted by howls of opposition in the assembly of notables.  Calonne and  Necker entered into a very public confrontation in 1787, which resulted in Necker's exile from Paris. In August 1788, as bankruptcy loomed and the reforms of Calonne and his successor Brienne were unable to stem the bleeding, Necker was called back by the king as director-general and minister of state in order to work his magic again   Realizing that bankruptcy was imminent,  Necker urged for the convocation of the Estates-General to raise new funds. Although the Estates-General had not met in 175 years, this was reluctantly announced by King Louis XVI.  In the meantime, anticipating trouble from the crop failures, Necker reinstated price controls.  At Necker's recommendation, King Louis XVI issued an edict creating short-term, interest-bearing paper (intended to circulate as money). However, facing a storm of protest, the edict was withdrawn a month later.  Necker arranged for a series of last-minute loans to stave off bankruptcy, but realized there was no avenue left but to wait for the convocation of the Estates-General .  The rest of the court, however, remained antagonistic After the opening of the Estates-General in May 1789, and the tribulations of the Third Estate,  Necker was one of the main voices in the royal council urging Louis XVI to reconcile himself with the self-proclaimed ""National Assembly"" (Assemblée nationale).  But at length the conservative elements of the court engineered his dismissal on July 11. It was upon the news of Necker's removal that Camille Desmoulins rallied the population of Paris, and spontaneous marches wound through the streets of the city, carrying wax busts of Necker, demanding his reinstatement. This culminated in the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789.  The humbled Louis XIV, on visiting Paris a few days later on July 17, restored Necker as minister of finance.  Finances, however, were still no better, and in early August, Necker arranged for an emergency loan of 30 million livres (Aug 9), and then another of 80 million livres (Aug 27).   In September 24, Necker delivered his stunning financial report to the Assembly, reporting that that he only managed to collect 12m of the 113m expected from the loans.  The country's credit was gone, and Necker requested a 25% income tax.  This was granted by the assembly the next day (but they also forgave all unpaid taxes before 1789).  But things were only getting worse.  The ""great fear"" in the countryside through the summer of 1789 had left many landowners with bigger problems on their hands.  The Autumn of 1789 was marked by starvation in France (October Days, etc.).  On November 14, Necker pleaded with the Assembly to give him permission to borrow 170 million livres from the Caisse d'Escompte, and authorize the bank to issue 240 million livres in paper money (covering the 90 million already borrowed). However, the scheme was turned down. But a month later, on December 19, the French National Assembly voted for an issue of 400 million livres of treasury bearer bills, known as assignats. In its first issue, the assignats bore an interest rate of 5% and were secured on confiscated church lands. The radical journalist Jean-Paul Marat promptly launched a smear campaign against Necker, accusing him of selling the nation to bankers. But economic policy was no longer really in Necker's hands, nor the king's, but in the Assembly.   In April 1790, there was a second issue of assignats of 400 million livres, this time only 3% and declared legal tender.  Through the first half of 1790, crown lands were sold off to make up for revenues and old Colbertiste policies that had been previously dear to Necker, like the internal controls on the grain trade, the French Indies company, the hated salt tax (gabelle) and labor dues (corvée), etc. were abolished.  In the popular press, Necker continued to be associated with the assignats, and hounded for it.  Necker was implicated by association in the bloody crackdown on the mutiny of Nancy. Having had enough, Necker finally resigned as minister of finance on September 4, 1790, and went into retirement on his Swiss estates. After Necker, control of the French treasury was taken up directly by the Assembly.  They fared little better - a mere month after Necker's departure, there was an additional issue of 1,200 million in assignats, and the declaration (Oct 14) suspending all interest payments, turning the assignats into fiat paper money proper.  Necker continued largely quietly at his Chateau de Coppet in Switzerland.  He published a small memoir in 1791 defending his tenure as finance minister.  He only returned to Paris in late 1792 to make a passionate plea before the National Assembly to spare the life of King Louis XVI.  Necker went on write a history of the French Revolution in 1796. Jacques Necker was the father of Anne Louise Germaine, Baronness de Staël-Holstein, the legendary Germanophile writer and salon-mistress, Madame de Staël, who wrote a personal memoir of her father.

Takashi Negishi, 1933-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/negishi.htm," Takashi Negishi was part of the ""Hicksian"" generation of Neo-Walrasian general equilibrium theorists. Educated at the University of Tokyo, Negishi rose to prominence (while still a graduate student!) during the late 1950s with his work on the Neo- Walrasian general equilibrium system. Negishi's signature has been his attempt to extend the multi-market Neo-Walrasian system in several directions to incorporate concerns such as international trade, imperfect competition, stability, money, trade and unemployment - and, as a consequence, helping to discover and delineate the limits of conventional theory. Negishi's 1960 paper provided a novel method of proving existence of equilibrium via the Second Welfare Theorem which was to be employed with much fruition by later economists (esp. those working on infinite commodity worlds). His 1961 attempt at incorporating imperfect competition into G.E. was not as successful, but it clearly revealed the problems associated with non-convexities in a Walrasian system. His work on stability of a Walrasian equilibrium was just as prodigious: his 1958 article reduced the number of condititions for tatonnement stability to merely gross substitution, while his 1962 paper with Hahn, he introduced the ""Hahn Process"" of non-tatonnement stability. His 1962 survey article on stability is considered authoritative.      Major works of Takashi Negishi   HET   Resources on  Takashi Negishi   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Hans Neisser, 1895-1975.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/neisser.htm,"Born in Wroclaw (then Breslau, Germany), Hans Philipp Neisser originated from an assimilated Jewish family.  Neisser studied law and economics at Freiburg, Munich and Breslau until 1916, and subsequently served as a soldier for the remainder of WWI.  Neisser received his doctorate in the aftermath in 1919-20.  Neisser went on to join the staff of the German Socialization Committee in Berlin form 1922 to 1924.  In 1925, Neisser launched the left-leaning weekly business magazine Wirtschaft.   He was subsequently appointed to a government commission to investigate German production in 1926.   In 1927, Hans Neisser joined the Kiel Institute, where he would quickly flourish. His 1928 treatise on monetary economics was well-received and served as his habilitation at the University of Kiel. Hans Neisser may today be best remembered by modern economists for his 1932 critique of the Walras-Cassel model which helped prompt the Vienna Colloquium into action. However, Neisser's other contributions to monetary theory (esp. what he called ""circuit velocity"", e.g. 1928, 1931, 1933),  structural growth and cycle theory (e.g. 1936, 1961) and econometrics - and philosophy (e.g. 1971) - bear out Schumpeter's description of him as ""one of the most brilliant economic minds"" of his generation. However, Neisser's early achievements were shadowed by the tumult into which his career was thrown. As a German Jew, social democrat and researcher at the Kiel Institute, Neisser was among the first to be expelled during the Nazi ascendancy - in spite of the extraordinary efforts made by the Kiel directors to retain him. He subsequently moved to the United States in 1933, where he became the first Jew to receive a position at the University of Pennsylvania. However, seven years later, Neisser was still untenured because ""he couldn't get along with anyone"". He gravitated to the New School for Social Research, where he joined his old Kiel colleagues, Adolph Lowe, Gerhard Colm and Jacob Marschak, where he remained for the rest of his career.

John von Neumann, 1903-1957.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/neumann.htm," Born in Budapest, Hungary in 1903. After simultaneously earning a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Budapest and a doctorate in chemistry from the University of Zurich, John von Neumann joined the faculty of the University of Berlin in 1927. He moved to Princeton in 1932 where he became the youngest member of the IAS. During this time, he made important contributions not only to pure and applied mathematics, but also to physics and, in some ways, philosophy (esp. in relation to the quantum paradox). He was also active in the Manhattan Project (the development of the atomic bomb) and was one of President Truman's advisors on the Atomic Energy Commission. His later work on parallel processes and networks has earned him the label of the ""father of the modern computer"". As Nicholas Kaldor would later write, ""He was unquestionably the nearest thing to a genius I have ever encountered."" An astoundingly creative mathematician, John von Neumann has played a rather important role in post-war economic theory through two essential pieces of work: his 1937 paper on a multi-sectoral growth model and his 1944 book (with Oskar Morgenstern) on game theory and uncertainty. John von Neumann's famous 1937 paper - actually, originally written and presented by von Neumann at a Princeton seminar in 1932, but only published in the Spring of 1937, at Karl Menger's request, in the proceedings of the famous ""Vienna Colloquium"".  It ostensibly derived from his reading of Wicksell and Cassel.  The 1937 paper has been called ""the greatest paper in mathematical economics that was ever written"" (E. Roy Weintraub, 1983). It precipitated what Morishima later called a veritable ""von Neumann Revolution"" in general equilibrium, capital and growth theory. He introduced several important concepts in his 1937 paper, besides the obvious methodological one of resurrecting ""mathematical economics"".   He bequeathed (1) the concept of ""activity analysis"" production sets, to be later extensively employed by Koopmans and the Neo-Walrasians; (2) linear system of reproduction as later used and developed by Leontief, Sraffa and the Neo-Ricardians; (3) price-cost and demand-supply inequalities which accounted for the Vienna Critique of Walrasian systems of equations; (4) the first use of a (generalization) of Brouwer's fixed- point theorem to prove the existence of an equilibrium, later to be known as Kakutani's Fixed Point Theorem; (5) The minimax and maximin solution methods and the saddlepoint characterizations; (6) early statements of duality theorems of mathematical programming and complementary slackness conditions; (7) a novel manner of incorporating fixed and circulating capital via joint production; (8)  the elucidation of the concept of ""balanced"" or ""steady-state"" growth - later employed with gusto by Harrod, Solow, Hicks and the entire flow of growth models since; (8) derivation of the ""Golden Rule"" - showing that the rate of interest is related to the rate of growth rather than the quantity of capital, anticipating Allais and the ""optimal growth theory"" and the turnpike theorems of Koopmans, Radner and others. John von Neumann's 1944 book with Oskar Morgenstern, Theory of Games and Economic Behavior was a landmark of twentieth century social science. The theory of games (what he called ""Gessellschaftsspiel"") had been single-handedly invented nearly a couple decades earlier by John von Neumann in a 1928 article, wherein he set up a two-person zero-sum game and provided a proof of the minimax theorem. The matter had laid dormant until von Neumann dusted it off again in the 1944 book, with another proof and more solution concepts.   Besides launching  entire field of Game Theory, the 1944 book  introduced several other important elements used in other fields of economics, such as the axiomatization of utility theory per se (as later pursued by Arrow, Debreu, etc.) and the axiomatization of the theory of choice under uncertainty, i.e. the formalization of the expected utility hypothesis.

Simon Newcomb, 1835-1909.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/newcomb.htm,"  Simon Newcomb was one of America's earliest (but not complete) converts to the Marginalist Revolution.  But he was neither an economist by training nor vocation. Rather, Newcomb was a renowned Johns Hopkins mathematician, physicist and astronomer who had risen from rags to intellectual riches. Nonetheless, he was equipped to help economics along its mathematical track. Newcomb was also one of the main developers of the Quantity Theory of Money (before Fisher) and was among the first economists to distinguish carefully between stocks and flows and, in doing so, provided the earliest clean statement of the theory of loanable funds.  On the whole, Newcomb was not necessarily a very nice person.  He was the quintessential American apologist and a steadfast opponent of the Institutionalist school.  He engaged Richard T. Ely in a particularly nasty Methodenstreit in the 1880s and 1890s, eventually being instrumental in securing the latter's departure from Johns Hopkins and the transformation of the American Economic Association into a wider professional organization.   Newcomb can be characterized as an ""apologist"" for economic doctrine.  He was an avid proponent of laissez-faire, but he coupled that with a vociferous and outspoken opposition to the emerging American labor union movement. Naturally, as a faithful devotee of the Quantity Theory, he helped create, he was also opposed to the inconvertibility of paper currency and the bimetallist movement.

Born and educated in Yorkshire, William Newmarch worked as a clerk for a local stamp distributor, insurance company and bank, before moving to London in the 1840s to take a job at Agra Bank.  In 1851, he resigned from Agra to become secretary at the Globe Insurance Company and, in 1862,became chief officer of the Glyn, Mills & Co. Bank, where would remain thereafter.  A free-trade activist, Newmarch was the author of the Merchants' Petition of 1820 and founder and leading organizer of the Political Economy Club of London, and contributed a 'Commercial History of the Year' column to The Economist and the Journal of the Statistical Society for twenty years (1863-82), reviewing the progress of trade. A liberal and member of the Reform Club, Newmarch authored one anonymous pamphlet (1859) in defense of Lord Derby's government. Newmarch's articles on the new gold finds in California and Australia in the Morning Chronicle, were collected into this first treatise, 1853.  Newmarch was one of the main figures of the English "" Banking School"" during the Bullionist Controversy.  He rejected the Quantity Theory without actually developed a clear monetary theory of his own. Newmarch was president of Section F of the BAAS in 1861, the first (non-noble) president of Statistical Society of London in 1869-71 (and long-time secretary and editor of its Journal).  Newmarch assisted Thomas Tooke in the compilation of volume 5 & 6 of his magnum opus on historical price statistics .He was a member of the Tooke Memorial Committee which managed the Tooke professorship at Kings' College London from 1859. After his death, a subcription was raised for the Newmarch Lectureship in Economic Science and Statistics at University College London.

Sir Isaac Newton, 1642-1727. ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/newton.htm," Cambridge genius, mathematician and scientist.  Sir Isaac Newton principal fame rests in his monumental Principia Mathematica (1687), wherein Newton famously introduced his three laws of motion and the concepts of mass, force and the principle of universal gravitation. In his Opticks (1704), Newton showed that white light was heterogeneously composed of more basic, primary rays, each with its own specific colour and index of refraction.  Independently of Gottfried Leibniz,  Newton was also the inventor of the mathematical calculus (defended by Voltaire and and much criticized by George Berkeley). In 1696, Newton gained an appointment as Warden of the Royal Mint and, in 1700, was made Master.  The semi-senile Newton was responsible for the determination of the relationship between the values of gold and silver in the minting of coins. His undervaluation of silver led to the effective formation of the gold standard.  His understanding of inflation was rather simple-minded -- blaming it on clipping and forgery.  Newton spent much of his spare time coming up with novel ways of combating inflation, i.e. coming up with new gruesome ways to torture and execute counterfeiters and clippers.

John Shield Nicholson, 1850-1927.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/nicholson.htm,"   Classical economist at Edinburgh, a one-time student, later a critic, of Alfred Marshall.  Born in Wrawby, Lincolnshire, the son of a Independent minister originating from Cumberland.  John Shield Nicholson obtained his B.A. in philosophy from King's College, London in 1870, and went on to study for a year at the University of Edinburgh.  He subsequently enrolled  at Trinity College, Cambridge, to study moral sciences.  At Cambridge, Nicholson came under the tutelage of Henry Sidgwick and Alfred Marshall (then a lecturer at St. John's), who introduced him to economics.  Nicholson was an early prize pupil of Marshall.  In 1877, Nicholson won the Cobden prize, with an essay that would become his first publication, the Effect of Machinery of Wages.  He completed his M.A. at London in 1878, winning the Gersternberg prize. Nicholson eked out a living as a tutor until his appointment in 1880, at the relatively young age of thirty, as Professor of Political Economy at the University of Edinburgh (more precisely, ""Professor of Commercial and Political Economy and Mercantile Law""). He would remain at Edinburgh until his retirement in 1925. In 1893, Nicholson published the first volume of his Principles, intended as a textbook for economics for the lay public.  It jostled for attention with Marshall's own recently published textbook.  Unimpressed by Neoclassicism, Nicholson sought to restate the old Classical truths in practical, appealing form.  Nicholson's attack on utility theory and Marshall's consumer surplus prompted a brief controversy with F.Y. Edgeworth in the 1894 edition of the Economic Journal.  While severely critical of the Neoclassicals, Nicholson was no less repelled by the English Historical School.  Nicholson's great strength was his ability to communicate economic questions to the general public. Nicholson did his best to explain all sides of current economic debates -- from the impact of mechanization to the fallacies of Marxism.  Like his great hero, Adam Smith, Nicholson nurtured a cautious liberal position, but he was not a doctrinaire laissez-faire apologist.   A believer in the virtues of competition, Nicholson was a virulent opponent of both trade unions and corporate trusts and was highly disturbed by the appeal of simple-minded socialism. However, at the same time, Nicholson was a believer in government regulation and anti-trust law, a bimetallist and a proponent of the underconsumption thesis of economic fluctuations.   John Shield Nicholson also had time to publish three novels  in 1888-1890. Nicholson was the first president of the Scottish Society of Economists (f.1897, since renamed Scottish Economic Society).      Major Works of John Shield Nicholson   Resources on John S.

William A. Niskanen, 1933-2011,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/niskanen.htm," Chicago-trained  economist, of the ""Public Choice"" school.   William A. Niskanen obtained his B.A. at Harvard in 1954, and his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1962.  In the 1960s, Niskanen worked as an analyst at the US Department of Defense, and later at the Office of Management and Budget. Niskanen is perhaps best known for his 1971 model of the ""budget-maximizing bureaucrat"", i.e. how government policy is guided (and distorted) by the incentives of government agencies and bureaucrats to increase their budgets and authority rather than serve the general public interest. Niskanen worked as the lead economist at the Ford Motor Company in the mid-1970s.   Niskanen became an economic advisor to Ronald Reagan, and served as a member of the Council of Economic Advisors from 1981 to 1985.

Sir Dudley North, 1641-1691.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/north.htm," English  Mercantilist of the ""liberal"" stripe. Born in Westminster, of a family of English notables.  His father was Dudley North, the  4th Baron North, an English peer, his brother Francis (Baron Guildford) was a notable jurist who would later become the Lord Chancellor of James II and another brother John became a cleric and master of Trinity College, Cambridge.  Dudley North, the fourth son, showed little aptitude for schooling, and was early designated for the mercantile life.  He was apprenticed to a overseas merchant involved in the English trade with Russia and the Ottoman empire.  In 1661, North was sent as a factor to Smyrna, Anatolia, but subsequently quarreled with his employer-partner, and began trading on his own account.  North's business flourished and he eventually moved to Constantinople.  North soon amassed a fortune and rose in the ranks of the English Levant Company, becoming treasurer by 1670.  Feeling wealthy enough, before the age of forty, Dudley North returned to England in 1680, leaving his business in Constantinople in the hands of another brother (Montague North). As a prominent figure in the City of London with well-placed relatives loyal to the crown, Dudley North was quickly fingered by the royal council of Charles II as a potentially useful figure, ""their man"" in otherwise hostile London.  In June, 1682, they arranged for North's election as sheriff of London, over the howling opposition of the Whigs. North was knighted in the course of his year's service and, around the same time, married Ann Cann Gunning, a wealthy widow and heiress, with a fortune larger than his own.  In 1683, North was appointed commissioner of customs, and a year later, in July 1684, appointed to the Treasury commission.  After the death of Charles II in 1685, North returned to the customs commission and was elected in 1685 as member of parliament for Bambury (cb).  At the Glorious Revolution of 1688, North did not flee England with other Jacobites, but stayed in London and transferred his loyalty to William of Orange.  Nonetheless, vengeful Whigs tried to implicate him in their retroactive investigation of his time as sheriff (notably his arrangement of the kangaroo trials that followed the Rye House plot in 1683), but North shook off the charges.  Dudley spent his remaining years focused on his trading business, and managing his fortune and that of his relatives.  He died on December 31, 1691.  A few weeks before his death, Sir Dudley North anonymously published his Discourse on Trade, one of the earliest treatises breaking the Mercantilist mould, moving it away with its obsession with precious metal and advocating free trade.  North's motives were to calm fears of the nascent English ""currency crisis"", when it was widely believed there was a scarcity of coinage due to a variety of factors, including gold and silver flowing out of the country by trade imbalances.  As a leading trader in London, North felt obligated to correct that impression.  Unlike his more empirically-minded contemporaries, like Petty, who swamped their readers with masses of data to support their case, North takes a ""rationalist"" approach, reminiscent of Newton and Descartes, to support his positions.  He systematically sets out fourteen propositions (prop), and defends them one by one. While North acknowledged money had real value as a metal commodity, and also an extra value for its convenient services in transactions, the wealth of the nation really consists of the satisfaction of consumption wants. North regarded trade as a ""commutation of superfluities"" (a way to get rid of produced surpluses, excess supplies in return for excess demands), and should not be merely though of  as a way a nation could acquire treasure.  North asserts that trade benefits traders and also benefits the country.  He denounces trade monopolies, which he argues are really curtailing trade under the veil of promoting it, and produce no benefit but simply transfer profits from one merchant to another.   He argued that prices, including the value of money as a commodity, are determined by supply and demand, and explains the relationship between excesses and price adjustment.. That the volume of money in circulation may be temporarily too little or too much, but ultimately the quantity of money adjusts to the needs of trade (he posits an automatic mechanism to explain hoarding and dishoarding of coins; he also underlines the importance of free minting and the ""theft"" of debasement).  Consequently ""shortage of money"" is often a red herring, and really is just an indicator of some kind of problem in real markets, with lack of revenues and profits, due to overproduction, some disruption of trade or shortfall in demand (he hints at an underconsumption thesis).   North advocates the lifting of trade restrictions, the elimination of price controls and a low interest rate policy to promote trade. And once trade picks up, the ""currency crisis"" will resolve itself.  North's 1691 tract did not have an impact - its print run was exceedingly small (North's brother suggests it was suppressed by royal order) and its existence largely unknown to contemporaries.  John Ramsay McCulloch stumbled on a copy and had it printed in his 1822 and then again in his 1856 collection on early English tracts.  [Note: McCulloch also suggested that a second scarce tract (Considerations of the East-India Trade, published in 1701 (p.541)),  might have also been written by Sir Dudley North.  As a result, the Considerations were for a long time attributed by historians of economic thought to North, but scholars (such as Viner) have shown otherwise (e.g. it refers to two East India Companies, which did not come into being until after North's death).  The Considerations are now usually attributed to Henry Martyn.] Historians have been divided on their estimation of Sir Dudley North.  Some (e.g. Schumpeter) regard it as a confused tract, or not any more noteworthy than other contemporary Mercantilist writers of liberal leanings.  But others have hailed North as a prescient anticipator of many of the arguments made a century later by Adam Smith (e.g. many assert North was among the first to distinguish capital as a separate factor of production).  They argue that North at least deserves the honors of ancestor to British Classicism similar to those afforded to his contemporary Boisguilbert by the French school.  The difference, of course, is that Boisguilbert was actually read by descendants, and was a decided influence, whereas North was only retroactively discovered. [Note: Scholars (e.g. Letwin) have also raised the question of whether North actually composed the Discourses by himself, at least as it is written, some suggesting the material may have been rearranged and massaged by his brother Roger North from a differently-organized draft left by Dudley, that Dudley was just a dyed-in-wool Mercantilist with muddled ideas, and it is Roger that deserves to be credited for deriving its liberal policy conclusions.]      Major Works of Sir Dudley North     Resources on  Dudley North     All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Edwin G. Nourse, 1883-1974,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/nourse.htm," American agricultural economist and US government advisor. Despite his suburban Chicago roots, Edwin Griswold Nourse studied agricultural economics at Cornell, and after a few interruptions, finally obtained his Ph.D. in 1915 from the University of Chicago. While teaching at the University of Arkansas,  Nourse wrote his first work. In 1918, Nourse joined Iowa State College, as head of its agricultural economics department.  In 1923, E.G. Nourse was recruited by the newly-founded Brookings Institution in Washington DC, to take charge of its agricultural research wing. He would remain there for the next two decades, eventually ascending to Director of Research in 1940. In 1946, President Harry Truman selected Edwin Nourse as the first chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors.  Nourse would remain there until in 1949.  Although Nourse presided over the Employment Act of 1946, his tenure at the CEA was marked by rivalry between the relatively conservative Nourse and his younger and more radical colleague, Leon Keyserling.  Nourse eventually resigned in December 1949, when he felt that Keyserling's policies were pushing the country into inflation.      Major Works of Edwin G. Nourse     Resources on Edwin G.

Ragnar Nurkse, 1907-1959.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/nurkse.htm," Followed up on Rostenstein- Rodan's thesis and anticipated much of the Lewis doctrine in stressing the role of savings and capital-formation in economic development. Early expounder of the ""balanced growth"" doctrine. Born and raised in Estonia, then part of the Russian empire, Ragnar Nurske began his education at the University of Dorpat (Tartu) in 1926. But in 1929, Nurske moved to Edinburgh, completing his first degree at the university there in 1932. Nurkse proceeded to Vienna, where he came into the orbit of the Austrian School, particularly Gottfried von Haberler. In 1934, Nurkse moved out of academia and joined the secretariat of the League of Nations in Geneva, working primarily as a researcher. With a few publications already under his belt, Nurkse enrolled in the Ph.D. program at Edinburgh, but never got around to completing it. During World War II, Nurkse emigrated with other League staff to Princeton, in the United States. Nurkse was the primary author of a League study on international currency problems that contributed to the Bretton Woods agreement. After the League was dissolved in 1945, Nurkse was briefly with the IAS in Princeton, then joined the faculty of Columbia in 1947.

It was at Columbia that Nurkse's interests shifted from international money to economic development. Nurske's famous 1953 tract, setting out his balanced growth doctrine, was based on lectures he had given in Rio de Janeiro and Cairo the previous year, and opened the discussion in the budding field. In 1959, Viner lured Nurkse to Princeton, but Nurkse never started. Nurkse died of a heart attack on a hike in the Swiss Alps in May 1959.

Georg Obrecht, 1547-1612.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/obrecht.htm," Alsatian 16th C. jurist and early Cameralist at Strasbourg Born in Strasbourg, Georg Obrecht studied law at Tübingen and thereafter moved to Paris in 1570 to continue his studies.  A protestant, Obrecht was caught up in the troubles of the French Wars of Religion and narrowly escaped the St. Bartholomew Day's Massacre in 1572,  albeit losing his library in the process.  He made his way to Basel, where he obtained his doctorate in 1574.  Obrecht became a professor of law at the University of Strasbourg in 1575, where he would remain for the much of the remainder of his life.  He became rector of the university in 1593, presiding over the period where Strasbourg eclipsed Wittenberg as the center of Protestant learning. Obrecht's early works, e.g. 1605, 1606, argues for the establishment of State insurance for children (as a revenue-raising device for the State - parents would pay into it during the lifetime of the child, the sum handed back should they survive to adulthood.).  Obrecht's principle economic work, Fünff underschiedliche Secreta Politica, (published posthumously in 1617, although an earlier edition - date unknown - had already been privately published for circulation among policymakers.)  It was composed as an administrative and fiscal handbook for Emperor Rudolf II, whom Obrecht served as a legal advisor since 1604.

Nicholas Oresme, 1320- 1382,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/oresme.htm," Nicolas Oresme (sometimes Nicole de Oresme or Nicolaus Oresmus) was a Medieval French Scholastic philosopher, mathematician and scientist. Originally of humble background from Normandy, Oresme studied theology with Jean Buridan in Paris.  Oresme was enrolled in the royal-subsidized College of Navarre in Paris, acquiring his master of arts before 1348 and made master of theology around 1356.  He remained as grand master of the College of Navarre until around 1361, when he became a canon and later dean of the cathedral of Rouen.  In Christmas 1363, he pronounced an energetic discourse, denouncing ecclesiastical luxury and corruption, before the Pope Urban V and the Sacred College in Avignon, that nearly got him accused of heresy (the discourse was frequently reproduced by later Protestant writers).  He wrote numerous treatises against astrology, a series of summaries of natural sciences and a significant christological treatise, De communicatione idiomatum.  Oresme is commonly credited as one of the prime developers of a ""clockwork"" theory of the universe, and an inventor and avid user of longitudinal plots and bar charts. Around 1360, Oresme became a confessor and counsellor of the Dauphin Charles (future King Charles V of France), and was commissioned by the king, around 1370, to undertake translations of several of Aristotle's works, notably his Ethics, Politics and Economics into vernacular French (albeit from the Latin translations, rather than the Greek original).   Oresme was made Bishop of Lisieux in 1377 and a French translation of the Bible is credited to him (although now known to be spurious).  A mathematician and originator of the ""clockwork"" theory of the universe.  Oresme has three economics-related works - his commentary on the Ethics, his commentary on the Politics and Economics and his celebrated 1373 treatise on coinage.  It is the last of these that contain his most original insights. In his commentaries on the Ethics, Oresme finds Ancient Greek and Medieval Christian morality largely in agreement. From the Politics, he discerns that monarchy is the ideal government, while oligarchy and democracy are less desirable. And from Economics, Oresme concludes that the pater familias is master, his wife a servant and slaves are mere brutes. In his famous 1373 monetary work, Oresme articulated a succinct version of the ""metallic"" theory of inflation.  In particular, his linked inflation to the (perennial) habit of European prince to debasing the currency.   Oresme accepted that the government was entitled to a modest seignorage gain, not only for the pure costs of minting, but also because coins had a ""usefulness"" (e.g. portability, wide acceptability, etc.) beyond their pure metal content. Oresme condemned ""alterations"" in the value of existing money (i.e. debasement) as simple theft.       Major Works of Nicole Oresme   Resources on Nicholas Oresme All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

António Horta Osório, 1882-1960,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/osorio.htm,"  António Horta Osório was a Portuguese disciple (at a distance) of the Lausanne School. Born in Lousa, the son of a noble family, Osorio took his degree in law at the University of Coimbra in 1908.  A curious man with vast interests, Osorio was a notable lawyer (he would assist the Bank of Portugal during the great Alves do Reis fraud case of 1925), an early automobile fanatic and Olympic fencer.  In 1911, the new republican government authorized the formation of the University of Lisbon, gathering within it various older schools, including the Escola Politécnica de Lisboa (what would later be renamed the Faculty of Sciences).  Hoping to secure an appointment to the chair in political economy, Osorio presented a candidacy thesis on the mathematical theory of exchange (1911).  Osorio's candidacy failed before the conservative appointment committee, who preferred a more-established juristic-literary empiricist, Afonso Costa.  Curiously, Costa himself lobbied hard for the opening of another chair, which he hoped to induce Osorio to take, but Osorio declined to apply, claiming that if they didn't find him useful the first time, they wouldn't find him useful the second. Osorio's 1911 thesis was presented as the first of two volumes (the second would never be written, probably out of disillusionment with the results of his candidacy).  It was translated and published in French in 1913 with a laudatory preface by Vilfredo Pareto. There is little that is original in Osorio's work - he follows closely the presentation of Walras, and, more pointedly, Pareto, who's own Manuale had only been published shortly before.  Osorio's first chapter traces the history of mathematical economics, before moving on to a discussion of the ""scope"" of pure analytical theory in economics.  He defends the mathematical method as a vehicle of discovery itself, declaring that ""if mathematics provides us merely with a new language, then it is not worth employing it"" (1911: p.9). Osorio takes severe issue with Walras's ""instrumental"" vision for it, and lauds instead Pareto's methodological stance (Pareto, in his preface, takes the opportunity to reinforce that and mock some of Walras's schemes).  Nonetheless, he faithfully reproduces the scheme from Walras's Elements (including tatonnement and counting equations and unknowns), before moving onto the presentations of Pareto's Cours (1896) and Manuel (1909). It ends rather abruptly, giving us no idea what Osorio might have had planned for the second volume. Osorio's work was not particularly successful. Edgeworth, Schumpeter and a handful of others gave it a tip of that hat, particularly to his ruminations on utility as an index, rather than a measure.  Lacking originality, it's principal merit was its attempt to popularize the work of the Lausanne School.

Melchior von Osse, 1506-1556.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/osse.htm,"Melchior von Osse (also spelled Ossa, but he signed himself ""Osse""), was an early German Cameralist at Leipzig, Saxony Born at Ossa, near Geithen, Saxony, Melchior von Osse studied law at Leipzig.  After a brief stint in the army, he returned to the university and became professor of law at Leipzig in 1536.  Around 1537, Osse became a counselor to the Albertine dukes of Saxony (Saxe-Meissen), before switching, in 1541, to the Ernestine Elector George Frederick I of Saxony (Saxe-Thuringia), the champion of the Protestant party in Germany.  From 1542, Osse served as the chancellor of the elector and his successors, resigning in 1549, possibly as a result of a falling-out with the powerful Lutheran theologian Phillip Melanchthon.  He served the counts of Henneberg as a court judge. He nonetheless represented the Elector at the Diet that eventually produced the 1555 Peace of Augbsurg.  Much of the legal code of the Saxon state is due to his work. Melchior von Osse's principal contribution to economics is his Testament, composed in the last year of his life, as a memoir delivered to the Elector Augustus I of Saxony, and intended as a government manual.   Throughout Osse attempts to distinguish the different obligations of the prince, on the one hand to further the ""well-being"" of his subjects, on the other hand to raise revenues for his treasury.  His concern was principally fiscal, advising the elector to organize a central budget, limiting his expenditures to the revenues of the seigneural demesne, and avoiding taxation except in extraordinary cases (such as wars).  He also discusses tariff restriction and price controls.

Elinor Ostrom, 1933-2012,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/ostrom.htm,"Elinor Ostrom was a political scientist in the Public Choice tradition of New Institutional economics. Born Elinor Clair Awan and raised in relatively difficult circumstances in Los Angeles, California.  She enrolled at UCLA and obtained her BA in 1954.  She met her first husband Charles Stewart in college, and accompanied him to Boston after graduation, where he was attended Harvard Law. They returned to Los Angeles, where Stewart began a corporate law career.  Dissatisfied as a lawyer's wife, Elinor decide to pursue graduate studies. Discouraged from pursuing advanced degree in economics, she instead studied political science at UCLA, receiving her Ph.D. in 1965, with a dissertation on water resource management. Elinor divorced her first husband and married fellow political scientist Vincent Ostrom in 1963.  When Vincent got an academic job at Indiana University in Bloomington, she moved with him and managed to obtain a job as a lecturer in the political science department.  Her early work was primarily on policing.  Both Vincent and Elinor Ostrom where greatly influenced by the appearance of James Buchanan & Gordon Tullock's Calculus of Consent (1962), and embraced the ""Public Choice"" perspective of grounding institutions in individual behavior.  The Ostroms went beyond them in trying to explain how institutions develop from the bottom-up and evolve, and the important role of self-government contributes to the efficiency of their design.  An important article by Vincent Ostrom, Charles Tiebout, and Robert Warren (1961) on local municipal government set the foundations of the ""Bloomington view"" that  decentralized, small organizations work better than larger, centralized ones.  The Ostroms would become the main propagators of the ""Bloomington view"", emphasizing the benefits of ""polycentricity"" (decentralized but cooperative institutions, a term first used by Michael Polanyi in 1951) over centralized institutions.  Elinor Ostrom took the theoretical attachment to polycentricity to empirical field work in the 1970s. The Ostroms established the Workshop on Political Theory and Policy Analysis (now the ""Ostrom Workshop"") at Indiana University in 1973 to study applications of local governance.  She was finally appointed professor of political science at Indiana in 1974. Particularly intriguing was the question of governance of common pool resources (e.g. open pastures, forests, fisheries, water supplies).  The conventional approach in economics at the time was primarily influenced by Garrett Hardin's (1968) paper on the ""Tragedy of the Commons"" (borrowing the phrase from W.F. Loyd, 1833) which characterized common pool resources  as finite, and likely to be over-exploited by individuals pursuing their self-interest without regard for the usage needs by others, which meant the commons would be eventually depleted and destroyed.  This was regarded by Hardin (and most mainstream economists) as a case of market failure. Hardin suggested that to prevent exhaustion, common resources needed to be managed by an external centralized authority, like a government, to take control, monitor behavior and and impose sanctions for over-utilization.  New Institutionalist economists, applying the Coase theorem, suggested that the problem could be ""solved"" by an external government assigning formal private property rights to the commons. Elinor Ostrom took the question up and investigated how common pool resources are actually managed in practice.  She conducted field work on local management of  various commons (e.g. pastures, forests, fisheries, irrigation systems) in various locations (Japan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka,  Canada, Spain, Philippines, etc.).  She discovered that in fact, contrary to Hardin's expectations, many local communities had learned to self-organize and collectively manage common resources in a sustainable manner.  Communities develop norms and rules, which are respected by the users of the resource.  Neither the artifact of formal property ownership nor an external central power were required to enforce it.   Communities had learned on their own to develop institutions of governance to escape the tragedy of the commons. Ostrom's principal work, Governing the Commons (1990), reported her main findings.   Not all of her field examples of local governance were successful, but those that were had several similar features.  Ostrom's identified several design principles which make for successful local governance.     Ostrom's approach is sometimes called the ""Institutional analysis and development framework"" (IAD).  It has become influential in economic development. Ostrom's work demonstrated more generally that there are cooperative solutions to collective action problems.  She showed how institutions - that is rules and norms - can develop endogeneously and lead to cooperative outcomes.  Elinor Ostrom won the  Nobel Memorial prize in 2009  ""for her analysis of economic governance, especially the commons"".  She shared the prize with Oliver E. Williamson.

"Samuel Jones Loyd, Lord Overstone", 1796-1883.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/overstone.htm," British banker, leader of the Currency School, and principal architect of Peel's Banking Act of 1844. Samuel Jones Loyd (not ""Lloyd""), known as Lord Overstone after 1850, was the son of Lewis Loyd, a Welsh dissenting minister, and Sarah Jones, heiress to a banking family.  Also out of that union would come forth the bank of Jones, Loyd & Co. of Manchester.  The junior Loyd was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1818 and taking up a position in his father's bank.  He entered politics immediately, representing the Parliamentary seat of Hythe for the Liberals from 1819 to 1826. Loyd's banking experience made him one of the leading experts on monetary and banking matters in Parliament.  And even after having lost his seat, Loyd continued to be called on for consultation by the ministers of the day.  After the financial crisis of 1825-26,  Parliament broke the Bank of England's monopoly by lifting the prohibition on establishing joint-stock banking companies (albeit note-issuing was limited to outside of London).  The sudden growth of new banks - and associated speculative excesses and spectacular failures - were a cause of serious concern.  Loyd positioned himself at the head of Currency School in the debates of the 1830s and 1840s.   The the country bank disturbances of 1836 and the revelation of the ""Palmer Rule"" in 1830s - that the Bank of England had been maintaining a gold reserve-liabilities ratio of one third -  provoked Loyd's 1837 pamphlet denouncing the rule as evidently inadequate.  Loyd proposed a stricter ""Currency Rule"",  that is, that the Bank should hold 100% gold reserves on note issues, which would thus make banknotes ""just like currency"", and thus eliminate any room for discretionary monetary policy.  He also demanded a  ""single bank of issue"", eliminating note-issuing country banks and extending the Bank of England's monopoly over all England.  In pamphlets and parliamentary evidence, Samuel Jones Loyd railed on the ills of allowing more than one bank of issue and called for tighter restrictions.  The Currency School gained ground and converts, most notably Sir Robert Peel.   Loyd virtually authored the 1844 Bank Charter Act (""Peel's Act"") imposing the Bank of England's monopoly on issue, tying note-issue strictly to gold reserves and severely restricting the creation of joint-stock banks.   The latter restrictions would be gradually lifted in 1858-62, but the remainder would continue in force until World War I. Loyd succeeded his father as head of the Jones, Loyd & Co. bank in 1844.  Curiously, in 1864, Jones, Loyd & Co. would be merged with the  London & Westminster bank, one of the 'new' joint stock banks (founded 1834) which he had so opposed, and had been managed by his free banking school rival, J.W. Gilbart. Loyd received a peerage in 1850, being made the First Baron Overstone of Overstone and Fotheringhay.  He was also the last. Upon his death, with only a daughter, the Overstone title became extinct.      Major Works of Samuel Loyd, Lord Overstone     Resources on Lord Overstone All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Robert Owen, 1771-1858,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/owen.htm," British industrialist and pioneer of utopian socialism. A ""doer"" more than a ""talker"", utopian socialist Robert Owen founded the famous New Lanark Mills in Scotland as an example of the viability of co-operative factory communities. Many industrialists actually visited these ""model factories"" and some even adopted parts of Owen's system. Owen attempted to extend these into agriculture - advocating collective farming, as in New Harmony, Indiana. Although most of these efforts failed, he continued on his social work - becoming the head of one of the largest trade union federations in Britain in 1843.

Thomas Paine, 1737-1809,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/paine.htm," English political philosopher and pamphleteer.  Thomas Paine, an English Quaker and bankrupt corset-maker, emigrated to America in 1774, when he was 37.  Armed with a letter of introduction from Benjamin Franklin, Paine soon set himself up as a journalist in Philadelphia.   Although he was not very long in American colonies, Paine quickly gained a sense of the mood, particularly from one of his Philadelphia hosts, Benjamin Rush.  Paine was one of the founding members of the Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society in 1775. Swept up by the cause of the American Revolution, Thomas Paine published his classic pamphlet, Common Sense, in January 1776, to explain the case for independence to the American people. In plain language, Paine describes the natural law theory of governments, and the origins of law as a contract, but that there is no place for a king or aristocracy, who will always corrupt the system into tyranny. Paine does not accept Locke's constitutional monarchy idea, nor Montesquieu's notion of checks and balances to democratic will. Paine uses Biblical imagery to restate equality of men in creation, without aristocracy. He then proceeds to discuss the American case, saying that being ruled by Britain makes no sense (distance, mistreatment, ethnic mix of peoples, religious reasons, etc.).  Independence is the best choice, Tom Paine declares, and presents an outline of a possible democratic governmental system for an independent United States.  First printed anonymously in Philadelphia, the pamphlet is an instant success and helps win over much of the common people (most of whom, unlike elites, were still on the fence) over to the cause of independence.  It was Paine who really changed the dialogue from being one about English constitutional rights, and negotiating a new ""constitutional"" basis for the relationship between America and Britain, to one of thinking about outright independence (particularly after Lexington).  Accompanying Washington's army, Paine wrote his stirring American Crisis in December 1776,  at the nadir of American fortunes (""These are the times which try men's souls...."").  Washington had it read to the troops to inspire morale.  He would continued putting out additional pamphlets under that title until 1783. Paine returned to Europe in 1787.  Paine soon moved to France to observe (and eventually participate) in the events of the revolution.  Paine's famous 1791 book, Rights of Man (published in two parts, in May 1791 and February 1792) was a defense of the French Revolution directed against critics, specificallly Edmund Burke.  The second part got Paine tried for seditious libel and outlawed in England.  Paine had already moved to France, where he became an honorary French citizen and a member of the National Convention  in September 1792.  Paine  and other Enlightenment luminaries, like his fellow delegate and close friend, the Marquis of Condorcet, were appointed together to a committee to draft a constitution for the new French Republic.  But by the time the document was ready in the early Spring of 1793, political events had changed and the radical Jacobins, on the ascendant, were no longer interested in the elaborately-constructed constitution of the savants, and set it aside.  When the moderate Girondists were finally purged in mid-1793, Paine was thrown temporarily in jail.  This is when Paine began working on his controversial tract on religion, Age of Reason. Thomas Paine returned to the United States in 1802, but despised for his religious views, Paine died a pauper and outcast.

Mary Paley (Marshall),1850-1944.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/paleymarshall.htm," English Neoclassical economist and wife of Alfred Marshall.  Mary Paley was a descendant of the  utilitarian philosopher and theologian William Paley.  Mary Paley would go on to become one of the first female students at Cambridge University.  She enrolled at the women's residence Sidgwick had established in 1871 (what would eventually becom become Newnham College, Cambridge).  She completed the Moral Sciences Tripos in 1874, achieving top marks, but could not receive a degree on account of her gender.  Paley was a lecturer in economics at Newnham College until 1876.  Mary Paley married her former economics teacher, Alfred Marshall, in 1876.  In 1885, the couple returned to Cambridge, and Paley resumed her lectureship at Newnham College.  Her lectures were compiled and published as Economics of Industry, with her husband as co-author (although the extent of his participation remains ambiguous). Mary Paley is frequently supposed to have had actively participated in the composition of Alfred Marshall's Principles, however there is little evidence to confirm that.

William Paley, 1743-1805,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/paley.htm," English theologian, utilitarian and proponent of ""natural religion"",.  Educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, William Paley became Senior Wrangler in 1763, the top student in the Cambridge Tripos mathematical exam. He remained on as fellow of Christ's College, becoming tutor in philosophy in 1768.  Paley's lectures, which touched on several economics-related topics, were published as Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy in 1785.  Parts of Paley's book would become incorporated in the famous Tripos examination at Cambridge. Paley's best-known work is probably his 1802 Natural Theology, a treatise on natural religion with monumental influence on 19th Century British thought, becoming required reading in all universities.  It is here where Paley articulated argument of intelligent design.  Paley articulated the famous allegory that stumbling upon a watch on the ground implies a watchmaker, so too does the complexity of nature imply a Creator.  Paley went on to construct his argument for intelligent design behind scientific laws, thus ranging him in opposition against the 18th C. deists like David Hume. Paley was a promulgator of the utilitarian system of ethics on the simple idea that as God is benevolent, He must desire the happiness of humans (for such sensations are present in the human animal), ergo it is a human duty to pursue happiness.  By the principle of diminishing marginal utility, Paley argued that a large but poor population might have greater general happiness than a small and rich population. Paley's natural theology inspired the Earl of Bridgewater to establish, through the Royal Society, the famous publication series of eight volumes, known as the Bridgewater Treatises, to explore and promote the conciliation of natural science and religion.  Thomas Chalmers and William Whewell contributed the first and third book of that series respectively. Charles Babbage's contribution, putatively titled as the ninth, was not commissioned but an independent effort..  William Paley was the great grand-father of Mary Paley Marshall.

R.H. Inglis Palgrave, 1827-1919,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/palgrave.htm," British banker, journalist, economist and statistician, editor of the famous Dictionary on Political Economy.  Sir Robert Harris Inglis Palgrave was the son of Francis Palgrave, a Medieval historian and Jewish convert (nee Cohen; Palgrave was his wife's surname).  R.H. Inglis Palgrave was educated at Charterhouse School but did not go on to university.  Although Palgrave would later help edit his father's academic work, his first instinct was to enter his grandfather's business in Yarmouth, the bank of Gurneys Birkbeck Barclay Buxtons & Orde in 1845.   R.H. Inglis Palgrave began publishing in the late 1860s. His 1871 essay won a prize from the Statistical Society of London.  His 1873 treatise, focusing particularly on bank statistics, set him out as one of the leading authorities on banking matters and spokesman of the country banks. Palgrave gave testimony to the House of Commons on banks of issue in 1875.  He edited the Banker's Almanack and Banker's Magazine.  In 1877,  after Bagehot's death, Palgrave succeeded him at The Economist, jointly with Daniel Conner Lathbury (pipping out Giffen).  Palgrave served as financial editor of The Economist from 1877 to 1883, and eventually bought a share of the newspaper. In 1883, Inglis Palgrave was president of Section F of the BAAS, and launched plans to create a society to publish a economics-dedicated journal, what eventually  became British Economic Association in 1890 (later renamed the Royal Economic Society). R.H. Inglis Palgrave's principal claim to fame is perhaps for having edited the comprehensive three-volume Dictionary of Political Economy, (1894-1901).   In 1987, a new dictionary of economics, edited by John Eatwell,  Murray Milgate and Peter Newman, and published by Macmillan, was entitled The New Palgrave: A dictionary of economics.

Sir Thomas Papillon, 1623-1702,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/papillon.htm," English liberal Mercantilist, and famous rival of Sir Josiah Child in the EIC. Descended from a prominent French Huguenot captain who had escaped to England after the Bartholomew Day's Massacre of 1576.  Thomas Papillon became an eminent merchant in the Mercer's Company of London and was active in the Huguenot community of London.  Papillon was made a director of the East India Company in 1663.  Long active in London politics, in 1675, Papillon entered national politics and was elected to parliament for Dover.  Losing his seat in 1681, Papillon became deputy-governor of the EIC at around this time and led the opposition to the schemes of the EIC governor Sir Josiah Child during the latter's stormy tenure in the 1680s.  Papillon was ousted by Child in 1682 and sold out his shares in the EIC. An active campaigner for religious tolerance, Papillon was condemned for sedition by Judge Jeffreys in 1684, in the context of the disputed 1682 elections of the London sheriffs (the judgment probably encouraged by Child's connections).  Facing £10,000 in fines, Papillon, like so many Whigs, promptly fled into exile in the Netherlands.  Papillon returned with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and was duly rewarded with a government post on the victualling commission.  In 1690, Papillon was elected to parliament for Dover (subsequently switched to London in 1695, a seat which held until 1700). Papillon continued to lead the opposition to the still-considerable influence of Child through the 1690s, arguing strenuously for the repeal of the EIC's monopoly and opening of East Indies trade to competition. In 1691, he helped establish a financial syndicate, meeting at Downgate, to raise funds for a rival  enterprise.  Papillon's efforts yielded fruit in 1694, when the East India Company's monopoly was revoked, and in 1698, when Papillon's new company (""The English Company Trading to the East Indies"") was chartered to compete with the older company (although Papillon himself didn't hold office in it).  The companies would co-exist as rivals for a few years, before being merged. Papillon is credited with the writing of the contentious tract The East India Trade (1677).  However, authorship of this has been disputed.  Some earlier writers credited it to Josiah Child, although Letwin (p.33) argues that the real author is Robert Ferguson, a Scottish divine, Whig spy and propagandist, better-known as one of the Rye-House plotters, who wrote the treatise at Papillon's house under his ""direction"".

Vilfredo Pareto, 1848-1923.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/pareto.htm," The Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto was one of the leaders of the Lausanne School and an illustrious member of the ""second generation"" of the Neoclassical revolution.  Although only moderately influential during his lifetime, his ""tastes-and-obstacles"" approach to general equilibrium theory were resurrected during the great ""Paretian Revival"" of the 1930s and have guided much of economics since. Vilfredo Pareto was born into an Italian aristocratic family in the year of people's revolutions, at its epicenter -- Paris, 1848.  His father, Raffaele Pareto, a Genoese marchese (marquis) and civil engineer, had fled to Paris in 1835 in self-imposed exile,  following the example of Mazzini and other Italian nationalists. Vilfredo was the third child (and first son) of his marriage to a Frenchwoman. The Pareto family returned to Genoa in 1852 where his father became a French teacher at a local school.  Around 1859, they moved to Casale Monferrato (Piedmont), where his father had another teaching appointment in accounting and agriculture at the Istituto Leardi. In 1862, Pareto's father took a civil service job in the ministry of agriculture, industry and trade in Turin, the Piedmontese (and now Italian) capital. Later that same year, when the provisional capital was moved to Florence (Tuscany), the marchese was forced to follow.  But his son stayed behind in Turin to complete his studies.  Vilfredo Pareto followed a conventional schooling, guided by his father. He obtained his Licenza de maturita from the Royal Technical Institute in Turin (1864), and proceeded to enroll at the University of Turin, where obtained a degree in mathematics and physics in 1867.  His first publication (1866) was published in his father's journal.  After a year of military service, Pareto signed up to take an advanced degree in civil engineering at the polytechnic institute of Turin. As his thesis on solid bodies makes evident, it is here Pareto acquired his knowledge about mechanical equilibrium that were to characterize his later contributions to economics.  After graduating at the top of his class in 1870, Pareto moved to Florence to take up a job as an engineer with the local branch of the Rome Railway Company (Società Strade Ferrate Romane), which had just been created from a merger.  The annexation of Rome -- the final step in the unification of Italy -- happened that very year and, naturally, much debate swirled around the political future of the new nation.  A radical democrat and ""classical liberal"", Pareto had been energized in his youth by the liberal ideals of Cavour -- and was consequently horrified at the Bismarckian-style interventionist state that was being called for by ""modern"" Italian politicians.   The strongly-opinionated Pareto was itching to get involved and speak his mind.  In 1872, he delivered his first address to the Accademia dei Georgofili, an agricultural economics research institute in Florence, defending radical parliamentary democracy and universal suffrage, while condemning Bismarckian paternalism.  It was here that he made the acquaintance of the celebrated Peruzzi family of Florence.  Pareto began attending the Peruzzi salons and imbibing in the political and intellectual milieu of post-risorgimento Italy.   In 1873, Pareto quit his humdrum job to and moved to San Giovanni Valdarno to take up a more responsible position with a local iron and steel company (Società per l'Industria del Ferro).   It was in dealing with the demands and  complaints of iron workers, that Pareto's interest in economics really picked up.  During this time, he took many business trips to Germany, France, Belgium, Austria, etc. and soaked up not only the politics, but also the local economic and sociological literature. He became a founding member of the ""Società Adamo Smith"" in Florence, launched by Ferrara in 1874. Pareto's first venture into economics came in 1877, in a celebrated address to the Accademia dei Georgofili. Pareto lashed out at the German Historical School -- then enjoying a wave of popularity in Italy after the fall of the Cavourist liberal government in 1876 and the installation of a more interventionist  government under Agostino Depretis.  The paternalistic politics, State interventionism and anti-theoretical stance of the Historicists rubbed against practically all of Pareto's instincts.  He also saved some nasty words for Auguste Comte, whom he regarded as a ""precursor"" to the Historicists, and defended the scientific claims of Classical economics. Pareto invoked Herbert Spencer's theory of social evolution as a response to what he perceived to be their nihilistic ""historical conditionality"". In 1880, the Valdano iron and steel concern was reorganized into the Società Ferriere d'Italia and Pareto himself elevated to managing director.  Released from menial duties, Pareto had more time to reflect -- and, now as director, more issues to reflect upon, particularly with regard to government regulation and worker conditions. Around this time, Pareto decided to get into politics himself.  In 1877, he had been elected to the municipal council of Valdano.  Now, in 1880, Pareto decided to run for national parliament as the radical party candidate for Montevarchi.  He lost.  He tried again in 1882, this time as a deputy for Pistoia.  He lost again.   Pareto's up-close-and-dirty experience with the mechanisms of political double-dealing and patronage embittered him permanently.  Henceforth, Pareto would take up the politics of resentment against the ""corrupt"" system.  He derided the Italian parliamentary system as a sham, a ""pluto-democracy"", a fig leaf for the naked power of the nobility and the wealthy.  In the newspapers and magazines of the day, Pareto disgustedly  identified and denounced the vested interests that lay behind new waves of economic regulation, protectionism and nationalization.  In 1886, Pareto came out strongly in another lecture to the Accademia, denouncing the hypocrisy of government for outlawing worker initiatives, like a minimum wage and the right to strike, on the grounds of laissez-faire, and yet happily putting up tariff walls and other protections for the profits of the rich.  Urged by his friends to run for a seat again, Pareto would reply, ""I prefer to discover shame rather than be a part of it.""  In 1887, the Belgian economist Gustave de Molinari spotted Pareto's tireless polemics in the press and invited him to submit articles on the Italian situation to the prestigious Journal d'economistes. Pareto happily acceded.  Through Molinari and the Journal, Pareto came quickly into the heady orbit of the French Liberal school. In 1889, after the death of his parents, Pareto changed his lifestyle completely.  He inherited the marchese title, but he never used it.  Instead, he quit his job, married a penniless girl from Venice, Alessandrina Bakunin (of Russian descent, but apparently unrelated to the other Bakunin), and, in 1890, moved to a villa in Fiesole.  His engineering career abandoned, Pareto sat down to become an ""intellectual"".   From his retreat, Pareto increased the frequency of his polemical articles -- which took on a particular urgency after the ascension of the openly Bismarckian government of Crespi in 1887. His alarmist articles were followed up by public lectures at a working man's institute and putting out feelers to the socialist cause.  He was quickly targeted as a troublemaker by the authorities.  Trailed by police, intimidated by hired thugs, his lectures were closed down and his applications for teaching posts blocked.  Pareto's activities now brought him to the attention of Maffeo Pantaleoni, then Italy's leading Neoclassical economist, and a friendship sparked between the two men..  In 1891, Pareto published an article in the Revue des deux mondes, which favorably cited an article by Pantaleoni.  The content of the article -- and the association between the serene academic and the revolted engineer -- came to the attention of the authorities and Pantaleoni was promptly dismissed from his teaching job at Bari.   Still, the two men only got closer.  Pantaleoni introduced Pareto to economic theory, particularly the Walrasian strand. Pareto, a quick learner with exceptionally good mathematical aptitude, took to it immediately.  Impressed, Pantaleoni invited Pareto to contribute a monthly column, the ""Cronache"", to his economics journal, the Giornale degli economisti. There Pareto demonstrated his new mastery of economics -- although he would also use the column to continue to take not-so-sly shots at the Italian government. In the meantime, Léon Walras was looking for someone to take over his chair in political economy at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.  Pantaleoni recommended Pareto to him -- ""He is an engineer like you; he is an economist not like you, but wishing to become like you, if you help him.""    Although courteous and respectful to each other in public, Walras and Pareto did not get along very well.   Walras and Pareto disagreed on many economic policy issues such as free trade and the role of the State.  They also had opposing temperaments -- Walras was a timid, bourgeois idealist while Pareto remained a caustic, disputatious, aristocratic cynic. In spite of this, Walras decided that Pareto ought to succeed him.  Pareto was appointed in 1893, and his position at Lausanne made permanent in 1894.  Doubtlessly, there were many people in Italy who were glad to see Pareto gone and safely hidden away in Switzerland.  But from his new academic perch, Pareto's nerve only increased.  His attacks on the Italian government continued in his monthly columns to the GdE and in foreign journals.  In 1893,  Pareto published an introduction to an abridged Italian edition of Karl Marx's Capital.  Pareto applauded Marx's theory of class struggle and even thought historical materialism was on the right track (albeit not deep and general enough, in his view).  But he deplored Marx's Oz-like conclusion and wrapped it all up with a wholesale denunciation of the socialist program. ""Any attack on economic freedom, from wherever it comes, is an evil.  Whether this freedom be violated in the name of bourgeois socialism or that of the people's socialism, the effect is the same -- a destruction of wealth which, in the end, falls on the poorer, more numerous part of the population, increasing its sufferings."" (Pareto, 1893). Pareto was attentive to his academic duties and produced a superb two-volume edition of his lecture notes at Lausanne, the Cours d'économie politique (1896-97).  Pareto opens the first part, on ""pure economics"", immediately with a suggestion to drop the worn-out term ""utility"" (which has connotations of ""well-being"") and replace it instead with ""ophelimity"" (which is simply meant to capture purely subjective ""desire"", which may or may not contribute to a person's ""well-being"").  Preferences was what Pareto wanted to get at.  For ""marginal utility"", Pareto substitutes the term ""elementary ophelimity"".   In the Cours, Pareto relegates math and diagrams to footnotes. His first depiction of a utility function is not additively separable, but the general one, U(x1, x2, ..., xn) from Edgeworth.   He notes that a person is only conscious of the marginal, and never the total, utility (§28; this argument was made earlier in a 1892 GdE article).   Pareto then steps back and adds some cautionary notes about scope and limits of economic science, e.g.  it does not cover ""motive"", but only a small facet of behavior in a social context and other motives and factors cannot be ignored.  He also repudiates any relationship with utilitarian philosophy.  From there, Pareto proceeds quickly to exchange.  He assumes price-taking behavior -- which he identifies with ""free competition"". He then takes a two-agent, two-good example and derives Gossen's law for exchange via the method of Lagrangian multipliers  -- reminding us, in the process, that utility is not comparable across people.  No demand curve is derived, although reference is made to the possibility of it (in a reference to a 1892, GdE article). This was more than merely an restatement of the doctrines of the Lausanne School.  Interspersed with his presentations of pure economic theory were numerous asides on methodology and applied economics and extensive sociological observations.   His recent reading of Karl Marx and Social Darwinists like Herbert Spencer leaves its imprimatur.   One of the contributions of the Cours was his exposition of ""Pareto's Law"" of income distribution.  He argued that in all countries and times, the distribution of income and wealth follows a regular logarithmic pattern that can be captured by the formula:     log N = log A + m log x 

where where N is the number of income earners who receive incomes higher than x, and A and m are constants.  Over the years, Pareto's Law has proved remarkably resilient in empirical studies. Another contribution of the Cours was Pareto's criticism of the marginal productivity theory of distribution. Pareto pointed out that it would fail in situations where there is imperfect competition or limited substitutability between factors.  He'd repeat his criticisms in future writings.   Also of importance was Pareto's observation that since the equilibrium is merely a solution to a set of simultaneous equations, then it is at least theoretically possible that a socialist or collectivist economy could ""calculate"" this solution and so attain exactly the same outcome as in a system guided by free markets.   This proposition was picked up and extended by Enrico Barone and became the first shot of the famous socialist calculation debate, .  The Abyssinian debacle in 1896 and string of political corruption scandals led to violent street demonstrations against the Italian government.  In a pre-emptive attempt to avoid a mass uprising, the authorities clamped down hard on liberals, socialists any other potential troublemakers.  Outspoken journalists and academics, like Pantaleoni, were dismissed and exiled. Pareto's ""Chronace""  were terminated in 1897.  In Switzerland,  Pareto assisted and even housed many Italian liberals and socialists that had been chased out of Italy (particularly after the 1898 May riots).  When the Dreyfus affair broke out in France, Pareto put his pen to work against the anti-Semitic French military authorities.  In a famous 1900 Rivista article, Pareto suddenly changed direction.  Heretofore a radical democrat, Pareto now decided to declare himself an anti-democrat.  The disturbances of the 1890s in Italy and France led Pareto to realize that, far from restoring true democracy, meritocracy and promoting social welfare, the radical movements were really just seeking to replace one élite with another élite, the privileges and structures of power remaining intact.  The struggle was not for a good society, Pareto concluded, but a squabble among élites over whom exactly was to going to govern.  And the ideals and theories they claimed to fight for?  Just propaganda, Pareto declared, the way upwardly-mobile folks incite the helpless, hopeless mob to take to the streets on their behalf.  For Pareto, humanitarianism, liberalism, socialism, communism, fascism, whatever, were all the same in the end. All ideologies were just smokescreens foisted by ""leaders"" who really only aspired to enjoy the privileges and powers of governing.   Pareto resumed his task as political polemicist -- and went on a crusade to expose the sham of political ideology and doctrine.  He condemned socialists of all stripes roundly in a 1902 book, but took particular aim at logically demolishing the ""new gospel"" of Marxism.  Marx had sold a delusion, Pareto declared.  The class struggle is eternal; the promised ""classless"" society that would emerge under communism was merely ideological fodder for socialist leaders to lay on their flock.  Of course, as a good Neoclassical, Pareto could not  fathom the labor theory of value either.  In 1906, Pareto published his Manual of Political Economy, his magnum opus on pure economics, that moved him out from the shadow of Walras.  Unlike the Cours, the Manual concentrates on presenting pure economics in an explicitly mathematical form (especially after it was heavily revised for the 1909 French edition).  The Walrasian equations are still there, but the focus is on formulating equilibrium in terms of solutions to individual problems of ""objectives and contraints"".  To illustrate this, the indifference curves of Edgeworth (1881) are employed extensively -- both in his theory of the consumer and, another great novelty, in his theory of the producer.  It is in the Manual that we find the first representation of what has since become known (and mislabeled) as the ""Edgeworth box"".  Like Irving Fisher (1892), Pareto embraced the idea that cardinal utility could be dispensed with.  Preferences were the primitive datum, and utility a mere representation of preference-ordering.   With this, Pareto not only inaugurated modern microeconomics, but he also demolished the ""unholy alliance"" of economics and utilitarianism.  In its stead, he introduced the notion of Pareto-optimality, the idea that a society is enjoying maximum ophelimity when no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.   (for more details, see our discussion of the Paretian general equilibrium system). His sociological observations also begin to indicate the future course of his ideas.  In 1900, Pareto had entered into a brief controversy in the Giornale degli economisti with Benedetto Croce.  Croce had criticized economists' positivistic approach, particularly the assumption of ""rational economic man"".   Pareto defended economists, but, at the same time, realized that the conventional defense was not even convincing enough to himself.  Why did the predictions of economics fail to correspond to reality?  Why were its policy recommendations, to him logically irrefutable, not adopted?  The explanation, he concluded, echoing Georges Sorel, was simply that much of human activity was driven not by logical action, but rather by non-logical action.  On this, of course, economics has nothing to say -- which is why, ultimately, economics will always fail empirically.  Pareto realized that he had to move beyond economics to look for his answer. Pareto retired from his chair at Lausanne in 1907, gradually passing on his teaching responsibilities to Pasquale Boninsegni.   He moved to Villa Angora in Céligny, near Lake Geneva.  There he was nursing a heart disease, surrounded by a dozen cats, his enormous personal library, a cellar full of superb wines and a large cabinet of exquisite liquers.  His wife ran off in 1901, but, as an Italian citizen, he could not legally divorce her.  A Frenchwoman, Jane Régis moved in shortly afterwards, and they remained devoted companions for the rest of his life. He only married her in 1923, after he became a citizen of the city-state of Fiume and thus overcame the legal obstacles to divorcing his first wife. Pareto used his time at Céligny to write his Trattato di sociologia generale, which was finally published, after wartime delays,  in 1916.  This was his great sociological masterpiece.   He explains how human action can be neatly reduced to residue and derivation.  People act on the basis of non-logical sentiments (residues) and invent justifications for them afterwards (derivations).   The derivation is thus just the content and form of the ideology itself.  But the residues are the real underlying problem, the particular cause of the squabbles that leads to the ""circulation of élites"". The underlying residue, he thought, was the only proper object of sociological enquiry.   Residues are non-logical sentiments, rooted in the basic aspirations and drives of people.  He identifies six classes of residues, all of which are present but unevenly distributed across people -- so the population is always a heterogeneous, differentiated mass of different psychic-types. The most important residues are what he calls Class I the ""instinct for combining"" (innovation) and Class II, the ""persistence of aggregates"" (conservation).   Class I types rule by guile, and are calculating, materialistic and innovating.  Class II types rule by force and are more bureaucratic, idealistic and conservative.   Pareto's theory of society claimed that there was a tendency to return to an equilibrium where a balanced amount of Class I and Class II people are present in the governing élites. People are always entering and leaving the élite thereby tending to restore the natural balance.  On occasion, when it gets too lopsided, an élite will be replaced en masse by another   If there are too many Class I people in a governing élites, this means that violent, conservative Class II's are in the lower echelons, itching and capable of taking power when the Class I's finally make a mess of things by too much cunning and corruption (he regarded Napoleon III's France and the Italian ""pluto-democratic"" system as an example).  If the governing élite is composed mostly of Class II types, then it will fall into a bureaucratic, inefficient and reactionary mess, easy prey for calculating upwardly-mobile Class I's (e.g. Tsarist Russia).     Pareto colored his sociological theory with numerous classical and contemporary illustrations of his theory.  He published two more books (1920, 1921) expanding on the theme.  His quasi-mystical arguments about the non-logical motivations attracted many Italian Fascists (Mussolini himself claimed to have attended his lectures at Lausanne).  Pareto was largely disdainful of the Fascist movement -- he never had patience for ideologies or ideologues -- but he found them quite amusing.  When Mussolini's small band of Class II Fascists marched on Rome in 1922 and brought the whole Class I-dominated Italian government tumbling down, Pareto mumbled triumphantly in his sick-bed, ""I told you so!"".  He was not unhappy at the turn of events. The Fascists showered Pareto with honors from afar, making him a Senator of the Kingdom of Italy, inviting him to join the Italian delegation to the Geneva Disarmament Conference, asking him to contribute to the Fascist party periodicals, etc.  He declined most of the honors, but spoke favorably of certain early reforms undertaken by the Fascists.  However, he also warned them to avoid despotism, censorship and economic corporatism.  When the Fascists clamped down on freedom of expression in Italian universities, Pareto managed to rouse himself to write a protest.   Pareto died a mere ten months into Mussolini's reign -- before the uglier aspects of Fascism became obvious.  The Fascists continued  to use his name unreservedly to give intellectual veneer to their movement.  Writing in 1938 on the legacy of Pareto, the economist (and Fascist) Luigi Amoroso would have the gumption to write (and Econometrica the editorial lapse to publish) the following: ""Just as the weaknesses of the flesh delayed, but could not prevent, the triumph of Saint Augustine, so a rationalistic vocation retarded but did not impede the flowering of the mysticism of Pareto. For that reason, Fascism, having become victorious, extolled him in life, and glorifies his memory, like that of a confessor of its faith.""  (Luigi Amoroso, ""Vilfredo Pareto"", Econometrica, 1938: p.21) Despite his posthumous association with Fascism, Pareto's sociological work has been taken seriously, going through recurring phases of popularity and  critical scrutiny. Freudian psychology has given much weight to some of his notions.  It is not so much its main thrust, but its roughness, simplicity and incompleteness that are the main sources of complaint.   Pareto's economics have had a much greater impact.  Pareto managed to construct a proper school around himself at Lausanne, including G.B. Antonelli, Boninsegni, Amoroso and others as disciples.  Outside this small group, his work also influenced W.E. Johnson, Eugen Slutsky and Arthur Bowley.  But Pareto's big break came posthumously in the 1930s and 1940s, a period which we have decided to call the ""Paretian Revival"".  His ""tastes-and-obstacles"" approach to demand were resurrected by John Hicks and R.G.D. Allen (1934) and extended and popularized by John Hicks (1939), Maurice Allais (1943) and Paul Samuelson (1947).  Pareto's work on welfare were resurrected by Harold Hotelling, Oskar Lange and the ""New Welfare Economics"" movement.  Finally, Pareto's ruminations on the potential efficiency of a collectivist society were aired in the Socialist Calculation Debate that broke out between the Paretians and the Austrians.

Sir Henry Parnell, 1776-1842.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/parnell.htm," Irish statesman, Bullionist and an architect of the 1815 Corn Laws. Irish baronet and politician Henry Brooke Parnell (future Lord Congleton) was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge (albeit leaving without taking a degree).  Parnell was elected to the Westminster Parliament in 1802 for his home, Queen's county in Ireland.  He lost his seat later that same year.  In 1806, he regained his Queen's county seat and would sit in the Westminster Parliament until 1832.   An Irish patriot, Parnell opposed the Act of Union of 1801.  In an 1807 book, he denounced the Penal Laws.  In 1809-11,  Parnell tried launch an inquiry into the inequitable system of Irish ""tithes"".  He was one of the main forces behind the Catholic Emancipation Bill.  He was the grand-uncle of another patriotic Irish politician, Charles Stewart Parnell.   Henry Parnell was particularly respected for his expertise in financial affairs -- perhaps unsurprisingly, given that his father had been the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the Irish government. Parnell famously took the bullionist position in his 1804 tract on the state of Irish currency, giving evidence that the excess of note issue in Ireland had been the principal cause of the c.10% discount by which Dublin notes circulated below par with English notes (compared to the 3% over-par in Belfast, which used metallic currency).  In 1806-7, Parnell served as Commissioner of  Treasury in Ireland.  He was a member of the famous Bullion Committee of 1810 and defended the Bullionist position of gradual resumption of payment in specie.  In early 1813, Parnell was appointed head of the Select Committee on the Corn Laws to look again into corn prices (which had begun declining lately).  In their Report (delivered May, 1813), the Parnell committee recommended strengthening the Corn Laws and restricting imports, citing food security and envisaging expansion of grain cultivation in Ireland to feed British workers.  The report was published on May 11, 1813 (Hansard, v.25 p.lxv) , and its dramatically protectionist recommendations.  Unlike prior Corn Law schemes, Parnell did not promote a fixed schedule, but rather a flexible threshold based on the average price of the prior twenty years plus a seventh, when prohibitive duties would kick in.  The report was eloquently defended by Parnell in parliament (June 15 and June 21. 1813).  Parnell insisted it was not a subsidy scheme for the landed interests, but rather blamed the apparently high high corn prices on import-dependence as domestic producers cut back production, and predicted that a protective regime would, in the long run, result in low prices permanently (partly as a result of increasing returns to agriculture).  Although many landed lords which dominated parliament welcomed the recommendations,  it was unable to act upon them before the end of the parliamentary session.  The bill was revived by Parnell the next year (May 5, 1814), submitting new set of simpler resolutions, but, facing prickly opposition from George Rose, its finalization was postponed again for another year.  Finally, in early February 1815, Frederick J. Robinson gave notice of his intention to go forward with it, and submit a Corn Law Bill.  The same month of February 1815 saw the rapid and near-simultaneous publication of the tracts of Edward West, Robert  Malthus, David Ricardo and Robert Torrens, each articulating independently a version of the Classical differential theory of rent.  Parnell's 1813 report and presentation had been their main touchstone, and their theory was constructed in an effort to disprove every one of Parnell's carefully-arrayed economic arguments, in the hope of persuading politicians to defeat the bill.  They failed.  The 1815 Corn Law bill resolutions submitted by Robinson (proposed Feb 17) were stronger than Parnell's, with absolute prohibition of importation of grain if the price of wheat fell below the fixed threshold of 80s per quarter.  The bill was submitted on March 1 (Mar 1) and went through much vigorous debate.  Parnell and Rose were relatively quiet this round, the main duel being between Robinson and the banker Alexander Baring.  Although Parnell's report was now two years old, and parliament was flooded with petitions against it, it passed the House of Commons on March 10 (Mar 10).  Kicked up to the House of Lords on Mar 13, where the Earl of Lauderdale defended the bill, the Corn Laws passed Lords two days later (Mar 15), and became law (55 George III, c.26).  The repeal of the Corn Laws would become the cause celebre of the Ricardian economists for the next thirty years.  After a vigorous campaign by the Anti-Corn Law League of Cobden and Bright, the Corn Laws were finally repealed in 1846. Despite his instrumental role in originally erecting the Corn Laws back in 1815, Parnell was nonetheless well-regarded by many ""Manchester School"" liberals for his later repudiation of those laws (cf. 1832: p.70), and embrace of free trade, as well as a wide range of other laissez faire positions.  Henry Parnell's most memorable performance in this regard was On Financial Reform (1830).  Parnell advocated a repeal of most taxes on industry, the balancing of the government budget, the lifting of tariffs (incl. Corn Laws), and end to colonialism and an end to the privileges of state-sponsored monopolies (which included the Bank of England).   Parnell (1827, 1832) advocated the adoption of a free banking system in England.   He stopped short in regard to roads (1833), recommending that the turnpike trusts be placed under the Commissioner of Land Revenues. One of the leading lights of the liberal Whig faction in the Westminster Parliament, Sir Henry Parnell initiated the vote of no confidence that led to the downfall of the conservative Tory Wellington government in 1830 and brought the Whigs back to power after a long absence.  In 1831, Parnell joined the Whig government of Earl Grey as Secretary of War, but resigned in 1832 over the Russo-Dutch War.   With the Parliamentary Reform Act of 1832 (one of his pet causes), Parnell lost his old seat, but he was promptly re-elected to Parliament, this time for the city of Dundee.  From 1835 to 1841, Parnell served in the lucrative post of Paymaster-General of the armed forces.  In 1841, he was elevated to a peerage -- Parnell was the first Baron Congleton.   After a long struggle with depression, Parnell committed suicide in 1842.      Major Works of Sir Henry Parnell     Resources on Sir Henry Parnell     All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Talcott Parsons, 1902-1979,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/parsons.htm,"  Founder of the American ""functionalist"" school of sociology, which sought to draw sociology away from the traditional view of society as an ""organism"" view to a ""mechanical"" view of social equilibrium.  Parsons was a professor at Harvard from 1927 until the end of his career. Talcott Parsons brought the continental sociological theories of Max Weber, Vilfredo Pareto  and Emile Durkheim to America.  The English translation of Vilfredo Pareto's Trattato in 1935 energized Parsons and his colleagues at Harvard.  Parsons helped set up the famous ""Pareto seminar"" at Harvard at this time, which included the participation of Joseph Schumpeter and L.J. Henderson.  This led up to Parsons' famous 1937 book, Structure of Social Action, which has been rightly regarded as a landmark in sociological theory, forging together the theories of Weber, Durkheim and Pareto into Parsons's single analytical scheme.

Luigi L. Pasinetti, 1930-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/pasinetti.htm," Leading member of the second generation of Cambridge Keynesians, Luigi Pasinetti also founded its Neo-Ricardian strain. Originally from Zanica (near Bergamo, Italy), Luigi Lodovico Pasinetti studied at the Catholic University in Milan, receiving his first degree in 1954, and going on to study at abroad at various locations, including Cambridge University, where he came under the influence of Piero Sraffa  Richard Kahn, Joan Robinson and others of the Cambridge School.  In 1961, Pasinetti was elected fellow of King's College, Cambridge, where he would remain for many years (he received his doctorate eventually in 1962). While still a research student, Luigi Pasinetti developed one of the first rigorous mathematical formulations of Ricardo's theory of value and distribution (1960). His insights led him later to develop one of the more general expositions of the reswitching problem in Neoclassical capital theory (1966) and thus made him a leader of the Cambridge (UK) side during the Cambridge Capital Controversy. Pasinetti also lent his efforts tot he Kaldorian theory of growth and placed that model as a centerpiece of the new Cambridge approach (1962).   No stranger to controversies, Pasinetti engaged his intellectual Neoclassical opponents head-on - Samuelson, Solow, Meade, Modigliani . Thus, Pasinetti was responsible for several fundamental pillars of Cambridge school. His efforts to develop the Neo-Ricardian strain are well-documented in his stunningly clear Lectures (1977) and in his Essays (1974) and his even more remarkable 1981 treatise.  Pasinetti left Cambridge in 1976, to become professor of economics at the Catholic University in Milan.  Pasinetti continued in pursuing the details and extending the applicability of the Neo- Ricardian system (e.g. 1980, 1988).  He has become particularly interested in structural change, i.e. the  responses of multi-sectoral models of the economy to technical changes.      Major works of Luigi L.

Don Patinkin, 1922-1995.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/patinkin.htm," Trained at Chicago under the tutelage of Oskar Lange and half-participating in the goings-on at the Cowles Commission next door, Don Patinkin emerged as one of the foremost authorities on monetary theory in the post-war year. His remarkable dissertation, Money, Interest and Prices (1956, greatly expanded in its 2nd edition in 1965) is an incomparable tour-de-force, plumbing the depths of economics and drawing up points which would later be of interest to many different fields - such as a disequilibrium formulation of macroeconomics, the problems arising from the distinction between stocks and flows, stability and path-dependency of equilibria, etc. His 1956 treatise remains a unique example of Neo-Keynesian theory at its best. Patinkin's central thesis in 1956 (already announced in a series of articles from 1948 to 1954) was the integration of monetary theory and Walrasian value theory. This task not only became central to Neo-Keynesian economics but was also instrumental in giving birth to various strands of Post-Walrasian theory. That integration, which had long eluded the marginalists, rested on the abandonement of Say's Law and the placing of money in the utility function - thus violating the principle of homogeneity of demand. The Quantity Theory, Patinkin claimed, indeed could not work without that violation. The ""Patinkin Controversy"" highlighted the glaring inability of  Neoclassical theory to satisfactorily incorporate money and led to a reassessment of the micro-macro link by the Post-Walrasians in the 1960s and 1970s as well as numerous attempts to reformulate a modern theory of money and credit. Patinkin was also instrumental (1948, 1949) in constructing the ""rigidity"" interpretation of Keynes that was to become central to the Neo-Keynesian synthesis. While recurrently engaged in the monetary debate he began, Don Patinkin, in his later years, became a remarkable scholar of J.M. Keynes, producing two remarkable books (1976, 1982) and a series of papers which challenged the Post Keynesian monopoly on interpretation. His parallel work on the history of the Chicago School (1981) also challenged Friedman's claims that he was working in its ""oral tradition"".

Simon Nelson Patten, 1852-1922.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/patten.htm,"  American historicist economist at Pennsylvania. Chicago-born, farm-raised Simon Nelson Patten studied at Northwestern before traveling to Germany  (along with classmate E.J. James) to study at the University of Halle  in Germany.  Patten obtained his doctorate under Johannes Conrad in 1878.  Like many of the ""new generation"" of German-trained economists, Patten found the traditional American universities uninterested, and had to find alternative employment.  Patten returned to farming for a while, then found work as a high school teacher. His old Halle comrade E.J. James had helped create the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.  James secured the appointment of Patten in 1888 as chair in political economy at Wharton, where he would remain for the remainder of his career. When James left for Chicago in 1896, Patten succeeded James as dean of Wharton, a position he would hold until 1912. A polemical economist and social philosopher, Simon Patten was the closest to the Henry Carey tradition in advocating protectionism (1890). His most famous book (1896), Patten argued that economic structures were evolving from ""pain economies"" to ""pleasure economies"" along lines similar, but distinct, from Spencer and Sumner.  Simon Nelson Patten was very influenced by the Progressive movement, his 1907 book called for the introduction of an income tax in the United States.  He was also a stringent advocate of prohibition of alcohol,  flirted with eugenics and contributed to the literature on Christian hymns.

Ivor F. Pearce, 1916-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/pearce.htm," British economic theorist. After finishing school in Bristol, England, Ivor Frank Pearce qualified as an accountant and worked in private industry from 1932 to 1939.  With the outbreak of World War II, Pearce served in the British Army from 1940 to 1946.  After the war, Pearce enrolled as an undergraduate in economics at the University of Bristol in 1946, completing his degree in 1949.   He was a lecturer at Nottingham from 1949 to 1956, along the way picking up a Ph.D. from the University of Nottingham in 1954.  Pearce moved to Australia, and become a Reader and subsequently professor at the Australian National University in Canberra from 1956 to 1961.  Ivor Pearce returned to Britain in 1962, becoming professor of economic theory at the University of Southampton, presiding over the growth of that department, until his retirement in 1981. Ivor Pearce made numerous seminal contributions to demand theory, international trade and general equilibrium theory.  Pearce famously took issue with Samuelson's ""factor price equalization"" theorem, highlighting the problems of factor intensity reversals (with James, 1952) and the problems arising with a large number of commodities (1959).   Pearce provided the general derivation of community indifference curves (1964).  From 1966 to 1976, Ivor Pearce was involved in the construction of the ""Southampton Model"", an econometric model of the United Kingdom.

Jessica B. Peixotto, 1864-1941,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/peixotto.htm,"Social economist at UC-Berkeley.

Jessica Blanche Peixotto was born in New York City, to a prosperous family of Portuguese Jews. The family moved west to San Francisco in 1870, and were active in numerous philanthropic causes. Jessica was the eldest child (and only girl) in five children. After graduating high school in 1880, Jessica was kept at home, while her four younger brothers would go on to achieve distinction in their own right in other professions. Nonetheless, Jessica's interests were kept alive by private tutoring and the active intellectual and social atmosphere in her family home.

In 1891, at the advanced age of twenty-seven, Jessica enrolled as a special student at the University of California-Berkeley receiving her B.A. in 1894.  Peixotto came under the influence of the heterodox historicist Bernard Moses, and stayed on for graduate degree in department of History and Political Science (under which economics was at the time)  After a year's research at the Sorbonne in Paris writing a dissertation on French socialism, Peixotto received her Ph.D from Berkeley in 1900 (although co-educational since the 1870s, Peixotto was only the second woman to receive a doctoral degree at that university; the first was Milicient Shinn in 1898, albeit in education rather than economics). Economics became its own department in 1902.  In 1903, Jessica Peixotto was appointed as instructor in sociology in the economics department at Berkeley, assigned to teach a course on socialism, but soon expanded her repetoire.  Peixotto was made assistant professor in 1907, associate in 1914 and finally full professor of  economics in 1918.    She would remain part of the Berkeley faculty until her retirement in 1935 Peixotto specialized on social economics, teaching courses on cost of living, poverty, household economics, etc. as well as holding a famous graduate seminar on the history of economic thought.   She was also continuously active in philanthropic causes outside the university.  Peixotto was appointed to the California State Board of Charities and Correction in 1912, where she would sit for a dozen years.

Raymond of Peñafort, 1180-1275.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/penafort.htm," Catalan Scholastic, compiler of the second major collection of canon law (Ecclesiastical law), after Gratian. Raymond of Peñafort was a native of Catalonia, and studied and taught at Barcelona, before moving to Bologna to study.  He taught canon law at Bologna  for many years  During this time he wrote his Summa luris Canonici, a handbook of canon law  (not a compilation).  He returned to Catalonia in 1222 and  became a canon of Barcelona cathedral and joined the Dominican order of preachers at an unusually late age (he was in his forties).  At the request of the Dominicans, he wrote an extensive Summa on the sacraments of penance and marriage. In 1230, Raymond of Peñafort was summoned to Rome by Pope Gregory IX to serve as his chaplain.  He was subsequently commissioned by the Pope to compile of a new collection of the eighty years of papal laws and decretals that hd been issued after Gratian's 1140 Decretum. The result of Peñafort labors was the Nova Compilatio decretalium, also known as the ""Five Books of the Decretals"" or the Liber Extra (extra meaning outside of Gratian), or the Decretales Gregorii IX. (as a matter of customary usage, it is common to reserve the term ""Decretum"" for Gratian and ""Decretals"" for Peñafort's collection) Raymond of Peñafort scoured and sifted the existing collections of post-Gratian decretals, most notably the five books known as the Quinque compilationes antiquae (""Five Old Compilations"").  These were: (Only two of the five (Tercia 1210 and Quinta, 1227) had been declared official by papal bull and given force of law.) Of the resulting 1971 chapters of Raymond de Peñafort's Nova Compilatio decretalium, 1771 chapters were drawn from these five old compilations, the Quinque, 191 chapters were new decretals from the papacy of Gregory IX, and the remaining 9 are a handful that were forgotten earlier. 383 Quinque decisions were omitted, as overlapping or superseded. In his bull Rex pacificus of 5 September, 1234, Pope Gregory IX declared that Peñafort's Nova Compilatio to be the official code of the canon law, all its decisions as written there, whether authentic or not, whether accurately reproduced from the original text or not, have the force of law. It also abrogates all the Quinque collections, even the official ones. However, it does not abrogate Gratian 's Decretum (but also does not make that official either). Gratian's Decretum and the  Peñafort Nova Compliatio were the only two texts of canon law used for a while, until the addition of the Liber Sextus of Pope Boniface XIII in 1298 and the Clementine Constitutions of Pope Clement V (1317).  These four books, taken together, constituted the Corpus Juris Canonici (Canon Law) during the Middle Ages. (Two more collections, the Viginti Extravagantes  Joannis XXII (1325) and the Extravagantes communes compiled by Jean Chappuis in 1505, are sometimes added to this list, although they were never given official status.). Shortly after completing his collection, Raymond of  Peñafort was offered the Archbishopric of Tarragona by the pope, but he turned down the offer.  He returned to Barcelona as a mere friar.  In 1238, he was elected Master-General of the Dominican Order and served for two years, during which he revised the constitutions and regulations of the order.  After he resigned, he set about trying to launch proselytizing missions among Muslims and Jews for much of the remainder of his life.  Raymond of  Peñafort was canonized as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church.

Arthur Latham Perry, 1830-1905.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/perry.htm,"American proto-marginalist economist, of the Catallactic School. Born of in rural Lyme, New Hampshire, the son of a Congregationalist pastor of Scotch-Irish extraction.  Arthur Latham Perry childhood was constrained by poverty after the early death of his father just before his birth.  His mother a widow with few means, Perry began working early, supporting himself from the age of eleven.  Perry nonetheless found the wherewithal to attend college, enrolling at William College in Massachusetts, obtaining his BA in 1852.  After a year teaching at a school in Washington, DC, Perry returned as a tutor at Williams in 1853.  He was appointed professor of political economy and history at Williams College in 1854, a position he would retain until his death.  In preparation for his lectures, Perry delved into the British classical literature.  His early lectures followed the Ricardian theory closely, but eventually (c.1863) achieved a conversion after coming across the work of Frederic Bastiat.  Discarding the Ricardian baggage, Perry embraced instead a ""catallactic"" perspective,  and  aligning him with the Oxford-Dublin school.  Arthur Latham Perry's Elements of Political Economy (1865), prepared as a college textbook to compete with Wayland's primer, was a reconstruction of economics from the catallactic perspective from its opening ""Political economy is the science of exchanges, or what is exactly equivalent, the science of values"" (p.1).  Perry discards classical cost theories of value, using ""utility"" instead, denounces the Matlhusian population doctrines, the wages fund and other classical Ricardian tenets.  The conversion is more complete is his two later volumes - the Introduction (1877), intended for high schools, and the Principles (1877), where the subject matter is reorganized so that the treatment of exchange and value precedes that of production (in contrast to the usual classical order). Perry was an enthusiastic proponent of free trade, which put him at odds with the contemporary American mood for protectionism. Perry was involved with the Free Trade League, gave public lectures on trade across the country and engaged in debates with protectionist leaders like Horace Greeley. He made many enemies, but also some friends, notably Orrin Sage, a Massachusetts industrialist who endowed Perry's chair at Williams College after 1871.  Perry had also deep religious attachments, and preached frequently in local chapels. As one of the few dedicated professors of economics in his time, Arthur L. Perry, was in a commanding position in American economics through the 1870s and into the 1880s, matched only perhaps by Francis Amasa Walker,  William G. Sumner at Yale and.C.F. Dunbar at Harvard. His Elements textbook was highly successful (it ran through 22 editions and was adopted in many colleges, including elite citadels like Yale).  However, as it turns out, Perry's long-run impact was limited, and he turned out not to be as influential as hoped or expected. Perry's economics was not carried on by a ""school of thought"".  This was partly because Perry remained faithfully at Williams College, a relative backwater.  His doctrinaire attachment to Manchester liberalism also made him suspect.  .But above everything, Perry's economics was too idiosyncratic - too distant from British classicism to be respectable, not nationalist enough to be embraced in America, and it was never really updated to account for new developments, like the Marginalist Revolution, making it of limited scientific interest.    Where Perry did have a decisive long-run imprint was in connecting the market system with Christian religious values, a feature that would permeate American apologism. Perry was inherently a dedicated teacher rather than a scholar, and did not follow or follow up, on the revolution he began . His writing was limited to his textbooks, and he did not really engage other academics in the reviews and journals.  After retiring from teaching in 1891, Perry's interests drifted to parochial local history.

François Perroux, 1903-1987.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/perroux.htm,"François Perroux belongs to that small, strange group of unique Frenchmen who, in spite of the Anglophone dominance of economics, still manage to occasionally infect the imagination of the economics world with their novel ideas. At Lyons, Perroux studied under Etienne Antonelli, the last lingering shadow of the Lausanne School.  Perroux himself taught at the faculty of law in Lyons from 1928 and subsequently Paris, from 1937 to 1976.  He also held a chair at the Collège de France for nearly fifty years. In many ways, Perroux inherited the mantle of Leon Walras and carried it to perhaps where the failed engineering student would have liked to have taken it. Like Walras, he was a Cartesian in method, a socialist in sentiment and an evolutionist in vision. His early acquaintance and interaction with other independent thinkers, such as Pantaleoni, Aftalion, Schumpeter, Morgenstern and Allais, added even more streams of flavor into his unique blend of thinking. After setting up the Institut de Sciences Economiques Appliqueées (ISEA) in 1944, Perroux had a chance to encounter and absorb the ideas of the younger economists which converged upon it. Perroux's first important book - La Valeur (1943) - was a rather standard exercise in understanding Walrasian thinking. But the germ was already there: ""general equilibrium"" as the interaction of multiple forces. These forces, Perroux contends, are active, constantly exerting change and capable of modifying not only economic parameters, but entire productive organization and social relationships.  Perroux is best known in the rest of the economics profession for his contributions to spatial economics and economic development.

Sir William Petty, 1623-1687.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/petty.htm," English Mercantilist, founder of ""political arithmetic"" William Petty, ""the most rational man in England"", as Samuel Pepys called him, or a ""frivolous, grasping, unprincipled adventurer"" as Karl Marx (1859) preferred,  was born the son of a clothier in Romsey, Hampshire.  Petty's early education was rather spotty until he ran away from home and took up as a job as a cabin boy on a merchant vessel at the age of 13.  Petty broke his leg aboard ship the very next year and, as per the custom of the time,  was marooned on the coast of Normandy.  The injured boy was picked up by French Jesuit clerics who, impressed by his intelligence, admitted him to their college in Caen, paying for his upkeep themselves.  The better part of Petty's education, particularly in mathematics, was acquired here. William Petty eventually returned to England where, after working for a short spell drafting sea charts, enlisted for a stint in the Royal Navy in 1640.  In 1643, as the Civil War between King and Parliament raged, Petty joined the wave of English refugees in the Netherlands and thereafter France.  This was probably the most enchanted time of Petty's life.  He pursued a variety of endeavors, working for an optician in Amsterdam, studying anatomy at Leyden, and consorting with other exiled luminaries. Most notable was Petty's stay in Paris as private secretary to Thomas Hobbes, through whom Petty was introduced to the bubbling intellectual milieu of the French capital, most notably the circle of Abbé Mersenne.  It in during this sojourn that Petty absorbed the tidings of the scientific method and empiricism, which he would soon himself carry into economics. In 1646,  Petty returned to England to put his late father's affairs in order.  After a failed attempt at selling his invention of a double-writing instrument, Petty gravitated to Oxford and continued his studies in medicine.  His resuscitation of the corpse of a young woman hanged for murder made him a bit of a local celebrity.  By 1650, Petty had become doctor of medicine, professor of anatomy,  fellow and vice-chancellor of Brasenose College, Oxford.  To this portfolio, he soon added (with the help of his haberdasher friend John Graunt) the chair in music at Gresham College in London (founded by Thomas Gresham back in 1597).  It was at Gresham that Petty fell in with a discussion group of young new scientists, notably  John Wilkins, Robert Boyle, Christopher Wren, John Wallis, Robert Hooke, et al. who jokingly called themselves the ""Invisible College"". In 1652, Petty took leave from Oxford and traveled as a physician-general in Cromwell's army in Ireland.  The punitive Act of Settlement of 1652 confiscated the lands of all Irish combatants and shunted much of the remaining population to the province of Connaught, leaving most of Ireland open to English settlement. Cromwell intended to use Irish land to reward veterans of the parliamentary army in lieu of cash wages, but also to settle with parliamentary creditors and raise cash from sale to a wide variety of Anglo-Scottish colonist ""adventurers"".  To this end, a comprehensive survey of the values of the confiscated estates was necessary.  One was already underway headed by the surveyor-general Benjamin Worsley.  But using the slow and painstaking means,  Worsley's survey would likely take 13 years to complete.  Petty, drawing on his practical experience with nautical charting, openly criticized Worsley's methods and proposed he could do it better and faster.  Finally, in December 1654, after enough politicking, the young doctor was given the contract to survey the army lands himself.  Using thousands of unemployed soldiers, rather than just a handful of skilled surveyors, and setting down the results by a central stable of cartographers assembled in Dublin, Petty finished the task of surveying half of Ireland - the notorious ""Down Survey"" - in a stunningly rapid 13 months.  Petty's Down Survey was to continue serving as the legal reference for land disputes in Ireland well into the 19th C. Petty made a fortune for himself in the process.  The poor clothier's son would end up with vast lands of his own across Ireland - according to Aubrey, some 50,000 acres, much of it around Kenmare, County Kerry, yielding an annual income of 7,000 to 8,000 pounds. This princely wealth he partly earned as a reward for his efforts in composing the survey.   The remainder he acquired while subsequently serving on the commission to distribute the land parcels among the veterans. This perch opened great avenues to private enrichment for himself and his cronies. Petty sealed numerous personal deals with soldiers who preferred to be bought out rather than wait to take possession of their land (and who knew the true value of these parcels of land better than Petty himself?).  Petty was subject to vicious accusations of corruption, fraud and malfeasance in the settlement of Irish army land.  A good part was undoubtedly true.  But much of it was also driven by the political rivalry between Henry Cromwell (the Lord Protector's son and Petty's close companion) and the ambitious Lord Deputy of Ireland, Charles Fleetwood (whose base was in the more radical republican camp in the army).  Petty was thus a natural lightning rod of criticism by a military party suspicious of the aggrandizing pretensions of the Cromwellian clan. The accusations reached a crescendo in 1658, after the death of mighty Oliver Cromwell.  The controversial ascendancy of his son Richard Cromwell reanimated the army's dormant republicanism.  When Petty was on a mission in London, the army officers in Ireland forced the weakened Henry Cromwell to reluctantly open an inquiry into Petty's affairs. But Petty persuaded Cromwell to pack the commission with his friends, and the army officers were unable to push a conviction.  In the meantime, Petty himself had successfully run for parliament for the seat of West Looe and moved back to England.  But his entry into Parliament was met by a renewal of the accusations, this time proffered by an army preacher, Sir Jerome Sanchey, on the floor of the House of Commons. But before this was resolved, parliament was dissolved in the political chaos that was rapidly enveloping England.  To clear his name, Petty felt compelled to put the details of this controversy before the public in print (1659, 1660).     In 1660, the army revolt collapsed and the Commonwealth  gave way to the restoration of the Stuart monarchy under Charles II. Both Henry Cromwell and Petty, who had long been at odds with the army, rendered critical services to the royalists in these heady days.  The new king Charles II was grateful and allowed Cromwell to retire gracefully and gave Petty entry into his court.  Petty rapidly won the confidence of the Stuart king, who bestowed a knighthood upon the clothier's son  in 1661.  Peerages were also offered, but Petty turned them down, seeing them as attempts to fob off his petitions to secure a real government post with policy influence - ""sooner be a copper farthing of intrinsic value than a brass half-crown, how gaudily soever it be stamped or gilded"", he muttered. Ideas - policy and otherwise - was something Petty was brimming with at this time.  Splitting his time between Oxford and London, Petty resumed his participation in the ""Invisible College"" of Boyle, Wren, Wilkins et al. which by 1662, had the king's approval and a royal charter of incorporation as the ""Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge"".  One of  Petty's more interesting endeavors at this time was the invention of a double-bottomed vessel, a prototype of which he gave King Charles II (eventually lost at sea), and a model of which was given to the Royal Society.  It was at this height that Petty published his first economic tract, the Treatise on Taxes and Contributions (1662) (initially published anonymously but authorship finally confirmed  publicly in 1685). Intended as a policy manual to increase royal revenues,  it was full of proposals for tax reform, trade policy and (something dear to his heart) the organization of a royal statistical agency which, naturally, Petty hoped to head himself.  The great innovation in this work was Petty's articulation (some say the first discovery) of the concept of the economic ""surplus"" and the labor theory of value.  Petty came up with is in the process of coming to grips with the ""mysterious nature"" of land rents.  A century before the Physiocrats, Petty eschewed characterizing rent as a cost, but rather saw it as a deduction from the surplus or net product (which he simply labels ""Rent"") of output after deducting the needs to sustain the labor and capital for next year's production. (""I say, that when this man hath subducted his seed out of the proceed of his Harvest, and also, what himself hath both eaten and given to others in exchange for Cloths, and other Natural necessaries; that the remainder of Corn is the natural and true Rent of the Land for that year"" (Petty, 1662 [1889: I, p.43]).  This is how Petty set up the first model of Classical reproduction.  [Petty approaches but does not quite hit on a differential theory of rent in his explanation of how proximity to market generates differences in rents.] Petty gropes onward towards a theory of value by positing the equivalence of the labor time and effort to produce this agricultural surplus with the amount of (surplus) money (that is, silver) that can be produced with the same labor time and effort. (""how much English money this Corn or rent is worth? I answer, so much as the money another single man can save, within the same time, over and above his expense, if he employed himself wholly to produce and make it"" (1662: p.43)).  So if the labor time to produce a silver shilling is equal to the labor time to produce a bushel of corn, then the value of a bushel is a shilling, and the value of a shilling is a bushel, ""one is the natural price of the other"" (Petty, 1662: p.50). In short, relative values are determined by relative labor time expended in their production.  Petty recognizes this labor value is not exact, that actual market prices can deviate from it incidentally: ""This I say to be the foundation of equallizing and balancing of values; yet in the superstructures and practices hereupon, I confess there is much variety, and intricacy"" (p.44).  Petty goes far enough out to explain the simple gravitational dynamic: if market values are not equal to labor-time values, then the producer of the underpriced commodity loses labor-time by exchange, and will find it to his advantage to concentrate his labor on producing the overpriced good. The consequent relative changes in supply will raise the price in the former and lower the price in the latter until market values equal intrinsic labor-time values again.  Petty departs from other writers of the Mercantilist age in viewing a nation's wealth as the real resources of the country, rather than in accumulated gold and silver. But, like other Mercantilists, he was concerned with the power of the monarchical state and consequently the efficient taxation of real wealth.  In his Verbum Sapienti (written c.1664/5 but left unpublished until 1691), Petty makes his first attempt at estimating the real wealth and income of England, a follow-up on his concern with the taxable base. Petty measures national income by the expenditure method - which he obtains by calculating the amount spent per person and multiplying that by the estimated number of people. Petty estimates that the population is about 6 million, and since the average person spends 4.5d per day on ""Food, Housing, Cloaths, and all other necessaries"" (Petty, 1665 [1899, p.107]), total expenditure adds up to £40 million per annum.  On the income side, he calculates land yields up £8 million and other estates £7 million,  implying (residually) that labor income must come to £25 million if income and expenditure are to be equated (p.108).  Besides the unsatisfactory lack of independent statistics for labor income, it did not occur to him that he was only measuring consumption expenditure and had overlooked the important category of investment expenditure on capital  This would later be corrected by his disciples Gregory King and Charles Davenant. Turning then to stocks, Petty attempts not only to measure the material wealth of the nation, but also its ""population-wealth"", that is the monetary value of the population itself (what can be interpreted as the monetary value of the productive capacity of the population).  By Petty's calculation, the material wealth of England at about £250 million and added upon that the ""population-wealth"" at a further £417 million (that is, £69 per head).  He obtains the latter from reasoning proportionally about income per wealth and the residual calculation of labor income (i.e. Petty stipulates £15/£250 = £25/(population wealth), thus deduces population wealth = £417). From this Petty's concludes that labor (""people considered without any estate at all"", p.110) is undertaxed, and that the tax burden between estates and people should be apportioned 3 to 5 (as per the income ratios).  He goes on to calculate that if laborers worked a little harder and ate a little less, they could afford to pay the income tax necessary to fulfill their share of the tax burden. Petty unambiguously viewed a large population as a good thing (""Fewness of people, is real poverty"" (1662 [1899: p.34])).  The natural policy question is consequently how to generate more labor.  Contrary to the Malthusian or utilitarian dynamics, Petty did not believe higher wages led to greater labor supply.  On the contrary, he sees only the backward-bending income effect: ""It is observed by Clothiers, and others, who employ great numbers of poor people, when Corn is extremely plentiful, that the labour of the poor is proportionally dear; and scarce to be had at all (so licentious are they who labor only to eat, or rather to drink."" (Petty, 1676 [1899: p.274]).  Consequently wages should not be high, but only just enough to allow workers to ""Live, Labour and Generate"" (Petty, 1672 [1899: p.181]). Although Petty suffered some losses through the Court of Innocents of 1662, his ownership of vast possessions in Ireland had been largely confirmed at the Restoration.  But the 1666 Court of Claims opened the issue again, and Petty felt compelled to interrupt his scientific and courtly endeavors and return to Dublin to defend his claims.  Petty returned to political economy in the 1670s, after he was called upon by Edward Chamberlayne for help in assembling materials on Ireland for a new edition of Chamberlayne's book, The Present State of England.  Petty's endeavors led to the composition of his own tract, The Political Anatomy of Ireland (1672, published 1691), followed up by a similar exercise for England, the famous Political Arithmetik (1676, published 1690).  It is in the preface to the latter that he makes his famous pronouncement in favor of scientific reasoning in economics: The Method I take to do this, is not yet very usual; for instead of using only comparative and superlative Words, and intellectual Arguments, I have taken the course (as a Specimen of the Political Arithmetick  I have long aimed at) to express my self in Terms of Number, Weight, or Measure; to use only Arguments of Sense, and to consider only such Causes, as have visible Foundations in Nature; leaving those that depend upon the mutable Minds, Opinions, Appetites, and Passions of particular Men, to the Consideration of others: (Petty, 1676 [1899: p.244]) Petty's Political Arithmetik (1676) attempts to compare the income and wealth of France, the Netherlands and Britain.  Calculating that France has 13 times the population and 80 times the land of the Netherlands, but only 3 times the income, Petty  proceeds ""to shew that this difference of Improvement in Wealth and Strength, arises from the Situation, Trade, and Policy of the places respectively; and in particular from Conveniencies for Shipping and Water Carriage."" (p.255).  Petty runs over some of the advantages of the Netherlands over France, which include geography(esp. waterways), national characteristics (work ethic, liberty of conscience), property rights (registries), banking and the Mercantilist policies of the Dutch Republic.  (Petty repeats the statistical exercise of 1665 (Petty (1676 [1899: p.]) calculating British income at £42, £16 in rents and profits, £26 in labor income, material wealth at £320 and population wealth at £520) Petty refrained from printing the Political Arithmetik.  It was privately circulated in manuscript form, and, in 1683, published anonymously without his consent under a different title.  It was only in 1690, after the Glorious Revolution and Petty's own death, that his family saw fit to finally publish it together with his anatomy of Ireland.  Petty's reticence was based on the book's consequences for foreign policy.  The Stuart monarchs, goaded by the Mercantilists, had pursued an actively hostile stance towards the nimble commercial republic of the Netherlands, and to this end, had cultivated an alliance with France.  But Petty, never much impressed by commercial wealth, diminished the importance of the Dutch competition with England.  It was France, and her vast real resources in land and people, that Petty feared to be the real danger. Consequently, his Political Arithmetik reeked with alarmist notes on the French ""threat"" to Britain. But so long as the Stuart kings were allied with France (indeed, receiving secret subsidies from the French monarch), Petty thought it unwise to embarrass them (and reap court disfavor for himself) with such a Gallophobic tract. In 1685, Petty retired to his lands in Ireland, and died two years later. A pupil of Hobbes, Petty was a Mercantilist in his policies, but one can find rudiments of the labor theory of value and thus is often regarded as a precursor of the Classical School. He was particularly influential upon Davenant and Locke. [In 1662, Petty's friend John Graunt published his Natural and Political Observations....Upon the Bills of Mortality, laying out the foundations for demographic and social statistics.  The tract was widely assumed to be Petty's own, a misattribution that some historians have since perpetuated.   There is now little doubt it was genuinely Graunt's, although the project may very well have been proposed and outlined to him by Petty. ]       Major Works of Sir William Petty     Resources on William Petty     All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Edmund S. Phelps, 1933-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/phelps.htm," American macroeconomist at Columbia, associated with the Monetarist school. Originating from Evanston, Illinois, Edmund S. Phalps obtained his B.A. from Amherst in 1955 and his Ph.D. from Yale in 1959.  From 1960 to 1966, Phelps was at Yale and associated with the Cowles Foundation.  After a sojourn at Penn, Edmund Phelps was appointed professor of economics at Columbia, where he has remained since. Phelps's early work on growth theory led to his discovery (via his 1961 ""Oiko Nomos"" fable) of ""Golden Rule"" for optimal growth.  But Phelps is perhaps best known for his assault on the Phillips Curve in the late 1960s, its augmentation by adaptive expectations and, most famously, the articulation of the ""natural rate of unemployment"" (or NAIRU) hypothesis (1967, 1968, 1970).  Phelps's natural rate concept, posited simultaneously by Milton Friedman, became a central plank of the Monetarist school during the debates of the 1970s.  Phelps went on to introduce search models into economics to explain frictional unemployment in the context of imperfect information. Edmund S. Phelps won the Nobel Memorial Prize in 2006 ""for his analysis of intertemporal tradeoffs in macroeconomic policy"".      Major works of Edmund S. Phelps     Resources on Edmund S.

Eugen von Philippovich, 1858-1917,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/philippovich.htm," Austrian School economist of the first generation. Eugen Philippovich, Freiherr von Philippsberg (normally shortened simply to Eugen von Philippovich) was born in Vienna, to a notably military family of Croatian heritage.  He studied law at Graz and Vienna, learning his economics from Carl Menger.  After graduating in 1880, Philippovich joined the civil service in the Austrian treasury, while preparing for his law degree.  Philippovich, took study trips to London and Berlin, and receiving his habilitation doctorate at Vienna in 1884, submitting his famous thesis on the history of the Bank of England.  He became a professor of economics and public finance at the University of Freiburg in 1885, promoted to full professor in 1888. In 1893, Philippovich returned to become professor of economics at the University of Vienna, to take the second chair in economics (the first chair was still held by Menger).. (Philippovich's chair at Freiburg would succeeded by Max Weber).   Philippovich's successful 1893 textbook help channel much of the Austrian marginal utility theory doctrine throughout German-speaking countries.  Alongside Wieser and Böhm-Bawerk. Philippovich taught the next generation of Austrian students (notably Joseph Schumpeter and Emil Lederer) In several ways, Philippovich was quite distinct from his other Austrian colleagues, and some have questioned whether he should be regarded as a proper member of the Austrian School.  Politically, Philippovich was left-center, having founded the Sozialpolitische Partei in 1896, served in the upper chamber of the Austrian parliament.  He was interested in social welfare, and served as something of a spiritual father of the Austrian ""Fabians"" seeking to introduce reforms.  His own research had overtones of the German Historical School and he organized conferences for the Verein fur socialpolitik in Viena in 1895 and 1909.  But unlike the polemical Historicists, Philippovich firmly believed in the central importance of economic theory, and marginalism in particular. The first volume of his 1893 textbook was uncompromising in its embrace of marginalism.  And it was very successful at spreading Menger's ideas.  It served as the principal economics textbook in German universities for the next three decades. Philippsberg retired in 1917 shortly before his death.  He was succeeded in his Vienna chair by Othmar Spann.      Major Works of Eugen von Philippovich     Resources on Eugen von Philippovich   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
A. William Phillips, 1914-1975.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/phillips.htm," Alban William Housego Phillips (known commonly simply as ""A.W."" or ""Bill"" Phillips) is the man whose name is attached the most famous curve in post-war economics - the ""Phillips Curve"", positing a relationship between inflation rate and the unemployment rate. The relationship Phillips discovered in his famous 1958 paper was not posited as a theoretical relationship but it was suggestive enough. Phillips's original study outlined the relationship between wage changes and unemployment between 1861 and 1957. His analysis actually dealt with finding cyclical movements in unemployment and wage growth. The 1861-1913 period gave him a counter-clockwise movement around a certain level of wage growth and unemployment, the 1948-1957 period, yielded a clockwise trajectory while the intermediate period (1918-39), had alternating cycles: clockwise, 1918-21; counter-clockwise, 1921-25; clockwise 1926-33; and counter-clockwise 1934-43. Phillips (1958) then fitted a curve through these findings and found that it yielded him the following: gw + 0.9 = 9.64 Ut-1.39 or: ln (gw + 0.9) = ln9.64 - 1.39 ln Ut where gw is the growth of money wages and Ut is the level of unemployment. There is, as Phillips noted, a negative relationship between unemployment and the growth of money wages. Therefore, this generated the general shape of the curve to which his name was lent. There were several theories-in-waiting. It was Richard Lipsey (1960) who developed Phillips's findings into a broader context, conceiving of wage inflation as a proxy for price inflation and incorporating the demand-pull explanation for the event. Kaldor (1959), on the other hand, opted for a ""cost-push"" explanation. Paul  Samuelson and Robert Solow (1960) took Lipsey's version and ran to the policy conclusions on output-inflation trade-offs. Phillips himself seemed little interested in such debates -- perhaps he had led too eventful a life beforehand to find them amusing. The New Zealand-born Phillips had worked in an Australian mine since he was sixteen, where he learnt electrical engineering; emigrating to Britain in 1937, he was soon involved in World War II and was taken prisoner by the Japanese. Released at the war's end, he returned to London and enrolled in the sociology department of the LSE. He soon became involved in economics and his engineering skills were put to use to create the famous ""Phillips Machine"" - a hydraulic model of the Keynesian economy which he described in his 1950 paper. He soon joined the faculty of statistics at the LSE, and in 1958, Phillips took up the vacant Tooke Professorship at King's College London.  He remained in London  until 1967, when he took up a post at the Australian National University. Phillips's work in the later part of his career was largely in optimal control theory and time series techniques in their application to econometrics. Phillips's work on moving average models and parameter estimation in stochastic difference equations have only been belatedly recognized -- remarkably enough by the same New Classical scholars which buried his curve!

Arthur Cecil Pigou , 1877-1959.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/pigou.htm," Cambridge Neoclassical economist. The son of an army officer, Arthur Cecil Pigou was educated at Harrow and, from 1896, King's College, Cambridge.  Starting off reading history,  Pigou studied economics under Alfred Marshall as part of the Moral Science Tripos, quickly becoming a prize pupil.  Through Marshall's efforts, Pigou began lecturing in economics himself in 1901, became a fellow of King's in 1902 and won the coveted Adam Smith Prize in 1903.   Arthur C. Pigou made his name in 1903, when he leaped headlong into the famous Tariff Reform debate raging in Britain.  Pigou deployed his pen and theoretical skills to countering the popular proposal to abandon free trade and embrace the 'imperial preference' system which would turn the British Empire into a protectionist trade bloc.  Marshall, the inherent academic, had long frowned on delving into the muck of public policy, but Pigou embraced it with vigor.   Indeed, in this and his subsequent works (1905, 1906, 1912), one can properly credit Pigou for launching the 'policy arm' of Cambridge Neoclassicism, turning its theoretical musings into a public science of practical policy relevance, reminiscent of the role played by Classical economists earlier in the century. In 1908, Pigou succeeded Marshall as Professor of Political Economy at Cambridge, in a famous controversy.  The chair had long been promised to former Marshall pupil Herbert S. Foxwell, who had reluctantly accepted the chair at UCL back in 1881, on the promise that he would return to succeed Marshall at Cambridge.  But by 1908, Marshall's preferences had changed and he secured Pigou's appointment to the chair, creating much bitterness with Foxwell.  To this injury was added insult in 1916, when Pigou petitioned for exemption from military service in World War I, on account that there was ""no one"" at Cambridge able to replace him (Foxwell was still lecturing there).  Holding the Cambridge professorship from 1908 to 1943, Arthur Cecil Pigou personified the ""Cambridge Neoclassicals"" - the heart of the Marshallian orthodoxy in the first third of the century. His main claim to fame is his Wealth and Welfare (1912, revised 1920 as Economics of Welfare). Here, Pigou brought social welfare into the scope of economic analysis.   In particular, Pigou is responsible for the famous distinction between private and social marginal products and costs and the idea that governments can, via a mixture of taxes and subsidies, correct such market failures - or ""internalize the externalities"".  But Pigou's luck soon ran out.  His approach came immediately under severe attack from Robbins and Knight.  The ""New Welfare Economics"" that arose in the late 1930s dispensed with much of Pigou's analytical toolbox altogether.  Later on, the Public Choice theorists assaulted Pigou's approach for its naive ""benevolent despot"" assumption and, finally, Coase demonstrated the irrelevance of Pigouvian taxes when property rights are properly assigned.  Another source of bad luck was John Maynard Keynes decision to use Pigou as the ""straight man"" in his polemics.  In the 1936 General Theory, Keynes held up Pigou's Theory of Unemployment (1933) as the example of everything that was wrong with Neoclassical macroeconomics.  Pigou never quite recovered from the shock of being betrayed by his old colleague and friend.  The rest of Pigou's life was spent occasionally counterattacking (e.g. with the ""Pigou Effect"" (1943, 1947) or submitting (e.g. 1945, 1951) to the Keynesian Revolution.

Gaëtan Pirou's principal claim to fame is as a teacher and historian of economic theory.  Although trained in the French historical tradition, his mission was to bring economic theory back into the French university curriculum, moving away from the political parables of the Liberals and the descriptive treatment of the Historicists, by putting French students in touch with the theoretical advances abroad, most notably the Austrians, the Lausanne School and the American Institutionalists.  However, Pirou's own training was unable to keep up with the accelerating mathematization of the 1930s, and so his efforts turned out to be of more doctrinal-historical than contemporary value.  Nonetheless, Piriou was a master of scholarship and exposition and took French economics a large (if incomplete) step forward. Pirou is particularly credited for resurrecting interest in the work of Leon Walras and ""discovering"" the importance of Auguste Walras.

In the 1790s, Francis Place was the head of the London Corresponding Society for parliamentary reform. His tailor's shop on Charing Cross Road became a center for radical agitation. Place played a critical role in the repeal of the Combination Acts in 1824, thereby legalizing trade unionism.  In the 1830s, became a leading Chartist and, in the 1840s, actively campaigned for the repeal of the Corn Laws and, in the 1850s, for the repeal of the Stamp Act.    Place's only book (1822) criticized Malthus, not so much for his analysis of the population problem, but rather for his failure to consider institutional solutions that might help solve it.  In addition to Place's numerous schemes to alleviate poverty, the one that stood out most controversially was his promotion of artificial contraception (although he had 15 children himself!).  It was for distributing Place's pamphlets on birth control that the young John Stuart Mill got arrested.

Georgy V. Plekhanov, 1856-1918. ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/plekhanov.htm," The ""father of Russian Marxism"", Georgy Plekhanov directed most of his writings against the Russian ""populist"" movement to which he once belonged.  Plekhanov insisted that, in principle, in semi-feudal societies such as the Russian, the first revolution would of necessity have to be a ""capitalist"" one.   However,  he noted that bourgeoisie was too weak to bring it about and thus it fell upon the proletariat to conduct ""both"" revolutions.  However, Plekhanov condemned the methods of Lenin and the Bolsheviks soon after 1917.    In theoretical terms, Plekhanov's 1894 treatise was perhaps one of the first to identify, or at least emphasize, the Hegelian element in Marxian theory -- it is to Plekhanov to whom we owe the term ""dialetical materialism"" -- which he saw as a way of ""unifying"" the various aspects of Marxian theory and thus prevent the intrusion of ""foreign"" philosophy, as Bernstein and the revisionists had attempted.

Karl Polanyi, 1886-1964.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/polanyi.htm," Austro-Hungarian economic historian and sociologist   Although Karl Polanyi's life was one of virtual nomadism - he never achieved a comfortable academic appointment - this maverick economic historian nonetheless exerted a powerful influence on his ivory tower contemporaries. Karl Polanyi was born in Vienna and raised in Budapest, to a well-to-do Hungarian family of Jewish origin (his younger brother was Michael Polanyi).  Karl Polanyi studied law at the University of Budapest, joining , in his student days, the circle of such luminary radicals such as Georg Lukacs and Karl Mannheim. Polanyi served as an officer in Austro-Hungarian army during World War I.  He was imprisoned on the Russian front but eventually released.  After the war, Polanyi found his way to Vienna, where carved out a career in journalism, eventually rising to become an editor of the Der Österreichische Volkswirt, a prestigious business paper.  With the rise of Austro-fascism, Karl Polanyi found his position in Vienna untenable and emigrated to Britain in 1933, where he lived hand-to-mouth as a tutor.  His Fabian friends found him a semi-stable job as an Oxford extension lecturer on English history, and it was in the course of this that he delved deeply into English social and economic history.  In 1940, during a lecture tour in the US, Polanyi decided to accept an offer by Bennington College. It was then that he wrote his magnum opus - The Great Transformation (1944), based on the morass of notes from his extension lectures. Polanyi's central thesis is well known among sociologists and economic historians: namely, that capitalism is a historical anomaly because while previous economic arrangements were ""embedded"" in social relations, in capitalism, the situations was reversed - social relations were defined by economic relations. In Polanyi's view, in the sweep of human history, rules of reciprocity, redistribution and communal obligations were far more frequent than market relations. However, not only did capitalism not exhibit them, its ascendancy actually destroyed them irreversibly. The ""great transformation"" of the industrial revolution was to completely replace all modes of social interaction with market interaction. The details of this ""ascendancy"" was Polanyi's other main contribution. Far from a ""natural"" or ""necessary"" outcome, Polanyi argued that capitalism evolved from the demands placed by new mercantile and then bourgois classes upon the State to protect their fledgling enterprises and precarious social status. In this way, governments became the handmaiden of capitalism, helping to advance it with the necessary legislation and execution by virtual force of arms. In some ways, Polanyi's thesis had a kinship to that of Marx, but one might also argue that it exhibited more fully the stamp of the German Historical School - particularly the latter-day versions of Weber and Simmel. Much, of course, was also owed to sociologists and economic anthropologists such as Durkheim, Malinowski and Thurnwald. Polanyi's work is still held as a classic in these fields.  In contrast, the New Economic History of North and Fogel argues the precise opposite of Polanyi's - namely, of the universal applicability of market theory to different eras in economic history. In 1947, Columbia invited him into their sociology department on the strength of his 1943 book. However, because his radical wife, Ilon Duczynska, had a prominent role in the failed Hungarian Revolution of the early 1920s, she was denied an entry visa into the United States. As a consequence, Polanyi was forced to move to Canada and commute to New York from Toronto for the rest of his career. Although he benefited much from his interdisciplinary work at Columbia - it was during this time that he put together his second great book, Trade and Markets in the Early Empires (1957) - Polanyi only held a visiting position as an adjunct at Columbia for the rest of his career. His extraordinary cross-country commute and his political and intellectual uniqueness led him to select himself out of Columbia's academic milieu. Unlike his better-established brother, the chemist and philosopher Michael Polanyi, Karl Polanyi was never able to set down roots. He remained in perpetual exile - from Hungary, from Austria, from America and finally, from academia as a whole.

Michael Polanyi, 1891-1976,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/mpolanyi.htm,"Chemist and philosopher, the Hungarian-born Michael Polanyi had a more stable career and a different political leaning that his radical older brother, the economic historian Karl Polanyi.  After a promising early career as a   physical chemist in Berlin,  Polanyi was dismissed by the Hitler regime and moved on to the University of Manchester and, later, Oxford.  It was during his stay in England that Michael Polanyi began moving away from science and towards economics, politics and philosophy.  A classical liberal, Michael Polanyi  followed the development of the Keynesian Revolution and wrote several pieces on Keynesian economics (e.g. 1944, 1945) and on the economics and politics of Soviet planning (e.g. 1935, 1938, 1940, 1948).  It is particular noticeable that Polanyi's recommendations on policy are clearly in the Keynesian line -- although he argued that private investment needed primarily government monetary, not fiscal, stimulus.  However much a Keynesian, Polanyi was an implacable opponent of planning in general and the Soviet system in particular.  In the post-war era, he moved away from economics and more deeply into his influential libertarian political writings (e.g. 1950) and the philosophy of knowledge (1946, 1958, 1968).

John Pollexfen, c.1638-1715,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/pollexfen.htm,"English Mercantilist, who flourished in the 1690s (exact dates of birth and death are uncertain). John Pollexfen had embarked on a career as a merchant, making his fortune in the important of wine from Portugal.  His borther, Henry Pollexfen, was a notably jurist and defender of Whig causes.  John Pollexfen had sat on the Committee on Trade and Plantations in 1675.  He was elected to parliament in 1679, and held his seat in subsequent elections, until 1702. John Pollexfen was appointed to the Board of Trade between 1696 to 1705. Although it seems Pollexfen was the domineering figure on the board,  John Locke among his colleagues and many of their arguments resemble each other, to the point where it is unclear who was influencing whom. In 1696, at the height of the English currency crisis, Pollexfen wrote a small tract on coinage for private circulation, that was subsequently published (1697) without his consent (an authorized version eventually was printed in 1700).  Pollexfen identified paper credit as the cause of problems in England's balance of trade and that had led to the scarcity of bullion. Pollexfen was also an avid opponent of the East India Company, and strongly urged the repeal of its privileges.  In 1697, Pollexfen engaged Charles D'Avenant in a very public debate over the East India Trade, with D'Avenant accusing Pollexfen of holding on to simple-minded and outdated notions of trade. Unusually for Mercantilists, Pollexfen often defended economic policies for their usefulness in the ""employment of the poor"", rather than just the cash it might bring.

George R. Porter, 1792-1855,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/porter.htm,"English businessman, civil servant, empiricist and statistician.  G.R. Porter was an early enthusiast and promoter of the development of statistics at the Board of Trade for government policy. Born into a London business family, George Richardson Porter was educated at Merchant Taylor's and was an intimate friend of David Ricardo (Porter would go on to marry his sister, Sarah Ricardo).  George Richardson Porter started out as a sugar broker, following his father's business, but fared poorly. Nonetheless, Porter put his practical business knowledge to print, writing a treatise on sugar production in 1830.  He went on to contribute an entry on life assurance for Charles Knight's Companion to the Almanac in 1831, and the volumes on silk manufacturing (1831) and porcelain and glass manufacturing (1832) for Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopedia.  These contributions set Porter out as an expert on business, with a particular penchant for organizing detail and data.  When, in 1832, George Eden (Lord Auckland), the President of the Board of Trade, asked Knight about getting someone to sort through the morass of data and information available in government blue books and parliamentary returns, Knight recommended Porter. Originally experimental for the first two years, Porter's statistical office was made a permanent fixture at the Board of Trade in 1834, with Porter as its first superintendent. He commissioned the publication of the Tables of the Revenue, a statistical yearbook, prelude to formal national accounting.   In 1840, Porter was also made superintendent of the new railway department at the Board,  and presided over the speculative boom in railway stock in the early 1840s.  Overworked and underpaid in these departmental positions, Porter's labors were rewarded when he was made one of the joint secretaries of the Board of Trade in 1841, with the bump in prestige and salary that brought.  Porter still found time, in the midst of all his official work, to put out works of his own. Porter's most notable work was his Progress of the Nation (1836-43), arguably the best compilation of empirical material for the state of the Britain and its empire in the first half of the 19th Century.   G.R. Porter helped found the Statistical Society of London (future RSS) in 1834 and became one of its most active members, serving as long-time vice-president, and later treasurer. G.R.Porter served as president of Section F of the BAAS in 1846.  Porter also contributed the chapter on ""Statistics"" to Herschel's Manual for the Admiralty.

Beatrice Potter (Webb), 1858-1943.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/webb.htm," Sidney Webb and his wife Beatrice Potter Webb were Victorian socialist activists, leaders of the Fabian Society and, later, the British Labour Party. Sidney Webb and Beatrice Potter met  in activist circles in London, and were married in 1892.  They became co-writers and collaborators in a myriad of social reform movements.  Originating from a wealthy Liverpool family, Beatrice Potter had been previously engaged to protectionist-imperialist politician Joseph Chamberlain.  She was also briefly the target of F.Y. Edgeworth's one and only attempt at courtship (the ""tiresome little professor"", as she called him, got nowhere).  Sidney came from humbler London roots.  He had joined the Fabian Society in 1885, brought in by journalist friend George Bernard Shaw, and contributed a series of famous informative tracts distributed by the Fabians, notably the famous Facts for Socialists in 1887.  Beatrice had taken an interest in working class conditions in the course of helping research her cousin Charles Booth's 1889-90 study on the poor, and published a work of her own on the Lancashire cooperative movements in 1891.   Hoping to follow it up with research on labor unions, Beatrice sought out Sidney, who was a said to be an expert on them. They married in 1892, and became frequent co-authors thereafter. Although less in public eye than her husband Sidney, Beatrice was nonetheless heavily active in the actual conduct of their policies. In her Minority Report to the 1909 Commission on the Poor Laws, Potter conjured up one of the first charters for a comprehensive social security scheme (i.e. state pensions) and a wider welfare state that was to emerge later in Europe and North America.

Raúl Prebisch, 1901-1986.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/prebisch.htm," Argentinian economist at the United Nations Commission for Latin America (UNCLA) and later at UNCTAD.  Raúl Federico Prebisch is credited with having developed the ""dependency"" thesis of economic development theory. Essentially, Prebisch argued that the colonial enterprise and international trade had not been necessarily useful for economic development - as the earlier theorists might imply. Rather, by changing and gearing the instititutional, production and socio-economic structures of a country towards the First World, colonialism had created a rather unique set of structural problems in these countries - namely, export-orientation and unbalanced growth. Third World countries were not as much ""underdeveloped"" as they were ""badly developed"". Prebisch argued that international trade only reinforcing this ""bad development"" path. With distorted national institutions and economic structures, Third World countries were defenseless to the distortionary development implied by trade-induced interaction with heavily-financed First World monopolistic capitalism. As a result, Third World countries, Prebisch argued, were being dragged into a state of ""dependency"" upon the First World, becoming the producers of raw material for First World manufacturing development - a ""center-periphery"" relationship. Prebisch argued that protectionism in trade and import- substitution strategies were acceptable, indeed necessary if these countries were to enter a self-sustaining development path. Prebisch's work, outlined in many Spanish-language and UNCLA Review texts, did not fail to impact economics. His thesis was similar to modern Neo-Marxian theory.

Seeking a platform for his economic views, in 1862, Price applied for the Drummond Professorship at Oxford, but lost to J.E. Thorold Rogers.  He applied again in 1868.  It was a fortuitous moment, as Oxford was then immersed in a conflict over the renewal of Thorold Rogers's appointment to the Drummond chair.  In 1867,  Oxford had repealed the old clause that required a two-year interval before a candidate could be considered for re-appointment.  Rogers applied for a renewal, but his personal and radical political proclivities had alienated a section of the Oxford electors.  They threw their weight behind the old Rugby schoolmaster and Bonamy Price won the election.  As it turns out, Bonamy Price was the first Drummond Professor to benefit from the repeal of the clause, being re-appointed in 1873, 1878 and 1883.  He remained at Oxford until the eve of his death in January 1888. An English historicist by instinct, and a severe critic of Ricardo and especially Mill, Bonamy Price is perhaps most famous for his pronouncements against Ricardian economics, indeed against all economic theory whatsoever.  ""So wild indeed has been this passion for scientific treatment,"", Price lamented, ""that Political Economy has been translated into mathematical formulas"", (1878:  p.3).   Economics was not a science, he asserted, but exalted common sense.  ""[Political Economy] is the application of common sense to familiar processes. It explains their nature and manner of working....But there is no strict sense in all of this, no deduction, step by step, from a few first principles, nor any construction of economic laws by induction. I can find no true economical law in Political Economy....What are called economic laws by most writers are mere tendencies. They profess no absolute and uniform character."" (Price, 1878: p.15-16) Although a free trader in principle, Bonamy Price discarded Ricardian tenets like the theory of rent and the Wages Fund doctrine, and endorsed the formation of  trade unions.  Bonamy Price is credited by Hayek as one of the developers of the ""over-consumption"" theory of the business cycle. (e.g. 1879, 1880).  In Price's view, over-consumption induces excessive over-production on false expectations of continued, and leads to industrial depressions. A broad church Anglican, Bonamy Price was a leading opponent of the ""Oxford movement"" of John H. Newman & co.  Bonamy Price was also a  long time advocate of university reform, seeking to bring Oxford closer to the modern German model, with emphasis on professorial teaching and research, and reducing the role of college tutors.  Although defensive of the Greek and Latin Classics, Price nonetheless sought to contain their role.  Unlike at Rugby, Bonamy Price's reputation as a teacher was not particularly great at Oxford, his modest scholarship and his eclecticism failed to inspire a school of thought around himself. Even his attachment to Historicism was intuitive, rather than a deeply researched alternative.  Bonamy Price's hostility to economic theory - coupled with his long-tenure as economist-in-chief - in no small way contributed to the general failure of Oxford to develop an alternative to the Marshallian orthodoxy then beginning to emanate from Cambridge.

L.L. Price, 1862-1950,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/llprice.htm,"Langford Lovell Price (or ""L.L. Price"" as he was best known) was an English economist, straddling the fence between the Marshallian and Historical school. . L.L. Price was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, receiving a first in classics  in 1885. He was later elected fellow of Oriel College in 1888. While a student, L.L. Price had come under the influence of Alfred Marshall (then at Oxford) and would remain a protege and friend of Marshall for years to come, despite Price being a historicist by instinct.  Marshall wrote the preface to Price's 1887 book and Price, in turn, reviewed Marshall's Principles favorably.   In his popular 1891 history of economic thought, Price followed the Marshallian line in minimizing the revolutionary impact of the Marginalist Revolution, attributing much of its innovations to J.S. Mill. In 1895-6, L.L. Price was appointed Newmarch professor of statistics at UCL and, in 1898, an examiner of the moral science tripos at Cambridge.  In 1903-04, L.L. Price became controversially involved in the tariff reform question, crossing Marshall by backing the party of imperial preferences rather than free trade.      Major Works of L.L.

Dr. Richard Price, 1723-1791,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/rprice.htm,"Anglo-Welsh dissenting preacher. moral and political philosopher, demographer and economist. Originating from Tynton, Glamorganshire (Wales), Richard Price was educated at dissenting academies.  He subsequently became a minister in Newington, Middlesex, and thereafter Hackney, and a lecturer at the Old Jewry meeting house in London.  In 1764, Price received a doctorate from a Scottish university, was thereafter referred to commonly as ""Dr. Price"".  He was picked up as an   William Petty Fitzmaurice (Earl of Shelburne),  leader of the powerful Pittite faction in parliament. His main work on ethics (1758), Richard Price posits a Kant-style theory of dutiful ethics, against the hedonics of  Shaftesbury, and the natural virtue of Hutcheson.   Price was a close friend of the proto-utilitarian Joseph Priestley, together forming the core of the ""Rational Dissenters"". Nonetheless, Price and Priestley disagreed completely on ethical philosophy, and their debate via letters was published in 1778 tract.  Price was allegedly the influence that led to the dismissal of Bentham's presentation of his utilitarian philosophy before Shelburne's circle. Richard Price is popularly best known for his 1776 treatise on civil liberties and vigorously defending the colonial case in the American Revolution.  Almost as well known for his tracts on the mounting British national debt.  Price proposals, first articulated in his 1769 Observations and separately detailed in his 1772 alarm, was to set up a ""sinking fund"" to retire public debt.  Price persuaded the prime minister William Pitt the Younger to establish the ""sinking fund"" in 1786 reallocating government revenues for the paying off of the national debt (or rather, re-establish it - a sinking fund had also been operated by Richard Walpole until 1733).  Pitt's sinking fund law set aside £1 million every year, in the hands of sinking-fund commissioners, who where to use it to purchase national debt, and then use the interest received from the treasury to expand its purchases of more debt. This was to continue until the interest on the purchased debt amounted to £4 million (which with the additional £1m appropriated annually, would set the size of the fund to retire £5 million per year).  The use of interest to pay for debt, rather than rely entirely on appropriations, was Price's principal contribution. Perhaps less well-known is Price's intimate involvement in debates over population, positing a significant decline in English population since 1688  Price's data would be later used by Malthus for his own essay.

Joseph Priestley, 1733-1804,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/priestley.htm," Joseph Priestley, probably the greatest English scientist since Newton, was also a utillitarian social philosopher. Born near Leeds and educated at dissenting academies, Joseph Priestley acquired a ""modern"" education in philosophy, science and history.  After graduating from Daventry Academy, he set himself up as a Presbyterian minister and schoolmaster.  In 1761, he became a tutor at Warrington Academy in Lancashire.  Priestley's experience as a teacher led him to write his 1765 book promoting the replacement of classical education with a more modern curriculum, based on science, arts, modern languages and history.  His 1765 Chart of Biography won him a doctorate in laws from the University of Edinburgh.  His 1767 book on the history of electricity was one of the most interesting defenses of intellectual history as a discipline. (interestingly, it was in the course of drawing the pictures for this book that stumbled on the fact that India rubber could erase lead pencil marks.) In 1766, Priestley met Benjamin Franklin who awakened his interest in electricity.  In 1766, Priestley discovered the Law of Inverse Squares, i.e. that the attraction or repulsion between two electric charges is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.  In this manner, he set the stage for Coulomb.  He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society that year. In 1767, Priestley moved back to Leeds.  Living next door to a brewery, he took up an interest in gases.  In 1772, he created carbon dioxide (and invented soda water) and nitrous oxide (laughing gas) in his laboratory.   In 1774, he revolutionized chemistry by isolating oxygen, thereby shattering the phlogiston theory (as Lavoisier had to show; Priestley continued to insist that they were compatible).   He also went on to study the properties of ammonia, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide.  Priestley was also the first to identify plant respiration and photosynthesis.    But for all his scientific contributions, Priestley was also an important social philosopher.  Priestley was a firm believer in free will and the possibility of human perfectibility through good education.   Together with Richard Price, he formed the nucleus of what was then called the ""Rational Dissenters"".  They believed that Reason and Necessity, coupled with Liberty and Freedom, were the guide to all human progress and social reform.   The Rational Dissenters also acquired a reputation as cold-hearted social reformers.  They laid the blame for social ills like poverty and unemployment entirely on the educational deficiency and/or a corrupt moral character of the poor themselves.  They refused to recognize that destitution and desperation might have wider causes.  Priestley was opposed to virtually any social safety nets -- such as the Poor Laws -- believing that the discipline of hunger and the absence of distractions (ale-houses and the like) would generate discipline and improve the morals of the poor.  Detested by the masses for his heartlessness towards the poor, Priestley was often burnt in effigy.   Priestley's 1768 book argued that the function of government was to promote ""general happiness"" and that this was the only standard by which the evaluate policy.  In his words: ""The good and happiness of the members, that is the majority of the members of the state, is the great standard by which every thing relating to that state must finally be determined."" (Priestley, 1768) Priestley's book made a deep impression of Jeremy Bentham, who drew upon it to develop his own utilitarian doctrine.  Priestley and Bentham were introduced to each other by the Earl of Shelbourne. In practical terms, the Rational Dissenters were strong proponents of parliamentary reform -- not on moral, but rather on historical grounds.   He was one of the developers of the myth that radical democracy had flourished in Saxon England before being displaced by Norman tyranny.  The whole progress of English history, he argued, had been characterized by a gradual recovery of these ancient rights.  Universal male suffrage was manifest destiny.  It was also on these grounds that Priestley (1774) attacked the British policy in America, arguing that the colonists were just reclaiming their traditional rights as freeborn Englishmen.   In 1773, Priestley took up an appointment in the Earl of Shelbourne's household, traveling with him to Europe (where he met Lavoisier).  In 1780, with a secure annuity, Priestley set himself up in a ministry at Birmingham.  It was during this time that Priestley became heavily engaged with the reformist Lunar Society with other Rational Dissenters. Throughout his life, Joseph Priestley dabbled in theology, eventually becoming one of the primary promulgators of Unitarianism, a dissenting religious movement that saw God as one being, eschewing Trinitarian Christian dogma and coming close to denying the divinity of Christ and the immortality of the soul. Priestley's tracts on religion (1777, 1778, 1782, 1784) were severely criticized by both the established and dissenting churches.  Although accused of atheism, Priestley was actually closer to theistic ""natural religion"".  He had defended the doctrine from David Hume's skepticism in his 1774 Letters.   The rationalist, ultra-liberal theology of Unitarianism attracted many Enlightenment deists, and propagated by Priestley, would grow in popularity in the 19th Century.  Among economists,  Jeremy Bentham, Harriet Martineau and John Stuart Mill and later W. Stanley Jevons and Philip Wicksteed were notable Unitarians. Influenced by Tom Paine, Priestley (1791) defended the French Revolution on the grounds that the republicans were ushering in the government by Reason.   This was the last straw.  Goaded by Tory politicians, Priestley's house and chapel were torn down by a Birmingham mob in 1791.  He moved to London, but found the environment very hostile -- especially after being made an honorary citizen of France and elected to the National Assembly.  As the French Revolution took a turn for the worst, Priestley decided to emigrate to America in 1794.  He settled down in Northumberland, Pennsylvania,  joining his two sons and his disciple Thomas Cooper, who had gone ahead of him.  Although seeking a quiet life, Priestley was greatly sought after by American politicians like Thomas Jefferson, and took the time to found the first Unitarian church in America.

To his own question, ""What is property?"", Proudhon answered famously, ""Property is theft"". Proudhon called for a complete reorganization of modern society that abolished most of its trappings - including money and the state itself. He advocated communitarianism as the form of reorganization of society.   He argued that ""goodwill"" would emerge naturally once these ""social constructs"" were gone.  Karl Marx directed his Poverty of Philosophy (1847) directly against Proudhon.  Léon Walras (1860) also had a go at a critique of Proudhon.

George Pryme, 1781-1868,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/pryme.htm," First professor of economics at  Cambridge University. Originating from a merchant family in Yorkshire, George Pryme enrolled in Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1799.  He graduated in 1803 and was elected fellow of Trinity in 1805.  He started off a career as a lawyer, enrolling at Lincoln's Inn in London in 1804.  But poor health eventually forced him to abandon his practice and return to Cambridge.  Although his health improved, Pryme stayed in Cambridge as a country lawyer, and got married in 1813. George Pryme was hired in 1816 to lecture on political economy at Cambridge University.  These were arguably the first lectures dedicated to political economy at Cambridge (William Paley had included political economy as part of his ""moral and political philosophy"" lectures back in 1770s; William Smyth had incorporated economic topics in his lectures on Modern History after 1807).  The initiative was apparently Pryme's own - the debate over the corn laws and the bullion resumption were at their height, and public interest was high.   Pryme sketched out a syllabus and submitted the request.  The university's vice-chancellor John Kaye (master of Christ's College) approved, but scheduled the lectures in the afternoon, so as not to interfere with the ""real"" college lectures..  He was not paid a regular salary, but had to collect fees from the students (usually less than £30 per year).  The lectures began on March 1816, with some 45 attendees.  Pryme's lectures were ""intended to facilitate the study of a science, hitherto inaccessible without the most arduous perseverance"", and covered ""the original and efficient causes of national prosperity, to shew by what measures of the legislature, and by what conduct of individuals in private life, it is augmented and diminished.""  It was a very elementary course, Pryme judiciously avoiding any polemics (he apparently relied on Smith and Steuart). But Pryme was a dull lecturer and the topic receded in public interest. As attendance waned, Pryme lectures were confined to alternate years. In 1825, Oxford University instituted the Drummond chair in political economy.   A similar plan had been hatched by William Huskisson for Cambridge, but only on the condition that it go to someone other than Pryme. Nonetheless, Pryme's administrative services to the university made him hard to exclude and the plan sunk.  Still, unwilling to be left behind by Oxford, the Cambridge senate finally decided to formally create the title of ""Professor of Political Economy"" for George Pryme on May 27, 1828.  It was a mere title, with no additional responsibilities nor emoluments.  Pryme's appointment to the chair in 1828 was opposed by William Whewell,  soon to become the master of Trinity College and arguably the dominant force at Cambridge during these decades.  Whewell had little respect for Pryme, and perceived him as an obstacle to introducing proper economics in the university.  And Pryme was distracted.  He maintained his legal practice throughout his tenure, and was heavily involved in local town politics since at least 1820.  At the time, the town of Cambridge was effectively a rotten borough, controlled by the Duke of Rutland.  But the 1832 Parliamentary reform opened it up, and Pryme and was elected as Cambridge town's first member of parliament in 1832, as a Whig for Cambridgeshire (Thomas Spring Rice was elected as fellow delegate).  Pryme retained the seat until 1841. George Pryme was still holding the economics chair in 1848, when Cambridge was persuaded to introduce the ""Moral Science Tripos"" in 1848, including political economy as one of the subjects of honors examinations. After nearly a half-century of lecturing,  Pryme finally retired in 1863, partly in an effort to force Cambridge to make the professorship into a permanent chair (Letters of 1861-63).  Cambridge senate finally went with it on October 29, 1863, approving a permanent chair with a salary of £300.  Pryme resigned the next day and was succeeded by  Henry Fawcett.

François Quesnay, 1694-1774.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/quesnay.htm," The humbly-born François Quesnay, the son of a plowman, trained himself in medicine, rising to become a physician in Louis XV's court and the leader of a sect of Enlightenment thinkers known as the Physiocrats or the économistes.  The working-class boy who could not read until he was 11 would be eventually elected to the Academy of Sciences and hailed as the ""Confucius of Europe"", the ""modern Socrates"", the ""Moses of our day"", by his gentlemen-disciples. Born in Méré to a family of laborers, Quesnay was orphaned at thirteen.  He learned to read from a household medical companion and quickly acquired a voracious appetite for more books and learning.  In 1711, he began an apprenticeship to a Parisian engraver, while attending courses at the surgeon's college of Saint-Côme.  After completing his apprenticeship in 1717, Quesnay married a Parisian grocer's daughter with a substantial dowry and set himself up as a barber-surgeon in Mantes, near Paris.   Quesnay's (rapid) self-education and skills shone through and, recommendation upon recommendation, he gradually climbed up the greasy pole.   In 1734, the widowed Quesnay entered into the service of the household of Louis François de Neuville, Duke de Villeroy, powerful lord of the Lyonnais.  This gave him some time to do more reading, studying and writing.    Quesnay cemented his reputation with his 1736 tract on surgery, prefaced by the separately-published Essai physique of much note. With this, he joined the struggle to elevate surgery (then a craft) to the status of a medical science (much to the academic medical establishment's horror).  King Louis XV's edict of 1743 separating surgeons from barbers was in small part due to Quesnay's influential tracts.  Interestingly, Quesnay had obtained a doctorate in medicine by then, but at Pont-á-Mousson rather than Paris.  It is around this time that François Le Peyronie, director of the newly-created Académie royale de chirurgie (royal college of surgeons), took up the role of mentor and sponsored Quesnay's appointment as its perpetual secretary.  Quesnay's 1743 ""Preface"" to the Memoires of the Academie is interesting as a tentative venture into epistemology and philosophy of science, holding up surgery as the ideal combination of theory, observation and practice that should be followed in all sciences (he would draw upon it later for his ""Evidence"" article in the Encyclopedie).   In 1749, on the strength of a strong recommendation, Quesnay became  the personal physician of Madame de Pompadour, the powerful mistress of King Louis XV and effective prime minister of France.  Quesnay settled in Versailles, finally entering the highest circle of power.  He was elected to both the Academié des Sciences and the Royal Society of London in 1751 and, the very next year, Quesnay received his letters of nobility.  Quesnay purchased his as first physician to the king with a loan from La Peyronie,  At Versailles, François Quesnay fell in with the philosophes, who curiously sought out the little country surgeon who had so bravely challenged the great doctors.  Quesnay's apartment in the entresol of the palace of Versailles, became a meeting ground for many of the great philosophers.  , d'Alembert, Helvetius, Turgot, Buffon and the Madame de Pompadour herself dined often in Quesnay's crowded rooms.  Adam , on his visit to France in 1766, spent several evenings there. Quesnay's interest in economics arose in 1756, where, hoping to draw on his country background, he was asked to contribute several articles on farming to the Encylopédie of Diderot and d'Alembert. (three of Quesnay's articles - ""Évidence"", ""Fermiers"", ""Grains"" - were published in the , four additional articles were drafted but withheld)  In preparation for his articles, Quesnay delved into the works  of the Maréchal de , Pierre de , Claude Herbert, Dutot and Richard Cantillon and, mixing all these ingredients together, Quesnay gradually came up with his famous economic theory.  In 1758, Quesnay wrote his Tableau Économique -- renowned for its famous ""zig-zag"" depiction of income flows between economic sectors-- to explain his doctrine.  It became the founding document of the Physiocratic system -- and the ancestor of the multisectoral input-output systems of , and and modern general equilibrium theory. (See our analysis of Quesnay's Tableau).   Quesnay began with the axiom that agriculture is the only source of produit net (net product, or surplus of output above cost).  He believed that manufacturing and commerce were ""sterile"" as (in his view), the value of their output was equal to the value of their inputs.  Only land, Quesnay reasoned, produced more than went into it. The wealth of a nation, Quesnay argued, lies in the size of its net product.   Quesnay opposed the mercantilist doctrines of Colbert, which still held sway in the French court, believing that they concentrated too much on propping up industry and commerce rather than agriculture.  Influenced by Vincent de Gournay, an advocate of laissez-faire, Quesnay wished to see many of the Medieval rules governing agricultural production lifted, permitting the economy to find its ""natural state"".   The natural state of the economy was conceived as the balanced circular flow of income between economic sectors and thus social classes which maximized the net product.  In these concepts, Quesnay saw analogies to the circulation of human blood and the homeostasis of a body.  Quesnay was largely responsible for the distinction between the ordre naturel (nature's order) and the ordre positif (positive, i.e. human-idealized, order).  A good government, Quesnay argued, should follow a  laissez-faire policy so that the ordre naturel could emerge. Cautious of his position in the royal palace, Quesnay did not publish his Tableau Economique under his name.  Indeed a decade later,  in his Physiocratie merely notes that the ""inventor the Tableau"" was a ""simple and modest man, who has never allowed himself to be named""  (1767: ) Quesnay had met the Marquis de Mirabeau in 1757 who quickly became his first full convert and the energetic founder of the ""sect"". Mirabeau was soon joined by Mercier de la Riviere, DuPont de Nemours and several others.  Through the 1760s, the sect gathered at Quesnay's Versailles but, unlike other visitors, they were not there for intellectual debate but rather to take down the words of the ""master"".  They took it upon themselves to popularize the Physiocratic doctrine.  It was the presentations, commentaries and elucidations upon Quesnay's system by Mirabeau (1760, 1763),  (1767) and DuPont de Nemours (1767) that gave Quesnay's ideas a more systematic feel.    After a brief interlude, Quesnay had another splurge of activity, writing numerous articles on economics in the Physiocratic journals then under the control of Dupont. Quesnay's articles appeared in 1765-8 in the Journal de l'agriculture, du commerce et de finances and in the under pseudonyms like M.N., M.H., M.A., M. de Isles, etc. (sometimes having his alter-egos enjoin in journal debates with each other, esp. Mr. H questioning the doctrine, Mr. N defending it).  Quesnay's 1766 formule article is perhaps his clearest presentation of his theory.    The Physiocratic sect's worship of Quesnay knew no bounds -- and, to some extent, this went to Quesnay's head.  The increasingly senile Quesnay began believing that he was, indeed, the wisest man in the kingdom.  Against the advice of d'Alembert, Turgot and other more cool-headed friends, Quesnay published in 1773 a mathematical book claiming to have uncovered new truths in geometry (including squaring the circle).  It was pure rubbish and Quesnay's reputation suffered accordingly.  ""It's the scandal to end all scandals, the sun has lost its light"", Turgot mumbled. The death of the Madame de Pompadour in 1764 weakened the protection the Physiocrats had enjoyed in Court, but King Louis XV stuck faithfully by Quesnay himself.  The affection was not reciprocated: Quesnay had little respect for the old pleasure-loving monarch, much preferring his grandson and heir.  However, upon ascending to the throne in 1774, the new King Louis XVI, eager to make a clean start for his reign, expelled Quesnay from Versailles' . Quesnay died later that same year.

Adolphe Quetelet, 1796-1874,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/quetelet.htm," Belgian mathematician, astronomer and founding father of modern statistics.  Born to family of Picardie immigrants and raised in French-occupied Ghent, Adolphe Quetelet  attended a French lycee in that city.  After his father's death, the young Quetelet began working as a mathematics tutor to bring in some extra francs.  In 1815, he was appointed as instructor in mathematics at a new collège set up by the Dutch royal government.  He proceeded to write a doctoral dissertation under J.G. Garnier at the newly-founded Dutch state university at Ghent. He subsequently took up an appointment at the Athenaeum in Brussels.  Bursting with ambition, the young Quetelet was elected to the Belgian Academy and submitted proposals to the government for the construction of an observatory in Brussels.  To that end, in 1823, he spent a sojourn at the Paris Observatory under Bouvard to acquire the necessary knowledge.  It was here that he learnt the method of least squares and the Laplacian theories of mathematical probability, then used in French astronomy.  He returned to Belgium, ready for the observatory (built 1828) and, more importantly, bubbling with enthusiasm for the new mathematical statistics.  Quetelet believed could be used as a unifying method, not only for astronomy, but for all sciences dependent on observation, including meteorology, biology and the social sciences.  His early statistical memoirs include attempts was on periodic curve-fitting on birth and mortality tables. He also began lecturing on probability theory, both at the Athenaeum and to the general public at the Brussels Museum (these lectures would be published in 1828). The 1830 revolution which restored Belgian independence nearly toppled Quetelet, who was perceived as too close to the Dutch government.   But Quetelet weathered the storm.  Indeed, it was in its immediate aftermath that he began producing some of his most revolutionary work.  The big impetus in this was his analysis of crime.  While the regularity of natural human phenomena, such as birth and mortality rates, was already well-known and ascribed as part of divine providence, the regularity of crime, being essentially a matter of human choice, was more surprising and repulsive to the prevailing thinking of the age.  An individual either commits a crime or he doesn't.  It is a free and moral decision, not a probability.  To suggest that a certain regular and predictable amount of crime happens in society yearly shifts the concern away from the concrete individual case to the aggregate, the ""state of society"".  Public policy and social reform, consequently, should not pin its hope on moral reform or punishment of particular individuals, but to address the aggregate, change the social configuration or general customs, if it hopes to make a dent on such phenomena.   To this end, Quetelet introduced the device of the ""average man"" (l'homme moyen), the 'representative agent' of a society, measurable not only in terms of average physical characteristics (height, weight, etc.) but also measurable ""moral"" characteristics (""penchants"" for crime, suicide, courage, etc., to be proxied by statistics).  This man, of course, does not exist.  But it is a useful fiction by which to examine ""differences"" in societies over space and time and the success or failure of policy reforms.  Actual man is distributed as a ""normal curve"" Quetelet's analysis, while obvious in our day, helped revolutionize thinking in Europe.  Public policy and social reform was to be refocused on aggregate measures within aggregate constraints and assessed by quantifiable results.  Social science was also revolutionized, one can say indeed ""created"" for the first time as a 'science' proper, as free individuals of wholly autonomous and capricious character were reduced to deviation errors from the homme moyen.  Society, it turns out, was governed by statistical laws, which can be discovered and quantified.  The ""progress of civilization"" is no longer a matter of conjectural history by stages and by analogy, but concretely and continuously measurable. Indeed, we can go so far as to say that Quetelet proved ""society"" exists, with particular characteristics and laws of its own, and not merely as shorthand for an aggregation of persons. In 1832, William Whewell invited Quetelet to present his results at a celebrated Cambridge meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.  It was a tremendous success, which helped lead to the foundation of ""Section F"" of the BAAS in 1833 and the Statistical Society of London in 1834.  Quetelet's1835 Sur l'homme et le développement de ses facultés presented his ideas to a wider public and was an international hit.  While not a Saint-Simonian himself, Quetelet's breakthrough seemed to confirm, or at least give quantifiable teeth, to the driving concept behind that movement (Quetelet absconded with their phrase, physique sociale, to describe his own work).  It also seemed to chime with the work of Quetelet's contemporary, August Comte, even though the latter disparaged Quetelet's work as ""mere data"" with no implications on his own schema.

Thomas de Quincey, 1785-1859,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/quincey.htm,"   Although better known as a literary figure, Thomas de Quincey was also a staunch and very eloquent supporter of the Ricardian Classical School.  Thomas de Quincey's life was fraught with misfortunes, most of them of his own making.  Born to a family of Manchester textile merchants, his father's early death portended problems to come.  After a brilliant early school career, Thoamas ran away from home at 17, living on the streets of London as a mendicant.  Reconciled to his family in 1803, he attended Worcester College, Oxford the next year.  It was around this time that he grew acquainted with the English romantic poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge and began experimenting with opium. In 1808, he dropped out of Oxford and moved to the Lake district, settling in at a cottage in Grasmere in 1809, near where his literary friends lived.  De Quincey had plans to write a great treatise on Kantian philosophy during his retreat, to be called ""De Emendatione Humani Intellectus"", but as his opium addiction deepened, he could hardly get it started.  In 1816, de Quincey married Margaret Simpson, the mother of his illegitimate child and grew gradually estranged from the Wordsworths. De Quincey's opium addiction became particularly acute in the two years between 1817 and 1819.  He would later publish his autobiographical recollections of this experience in his famous Confessions of an Opium Eater, first published in London Magazine in 1820. According to his recollections, around 1811, at the age of 26, Thomas De Quincey began reading political economy, devouring books from English and French classical economists, but was not particularly impressed by them.  In the depths of his worst period of his opium addiction, in late 1818, a friend sent him a copy of David Ricardo's Principles, which he took up as an instant convert, and became practically a lifesaver.  De Quincey records his encounter with Ricardo's theory in his Confessions: ""In this state of imbecility, I had, for amusement, turned my attention to political economy. My understanding, which formerly had been as active and restless as a hyena, could not, I suppose (so long as I lived at all), sink into utter lethargy; and political economy offers this advantage to a person in my state - that, though it is eminently an organic science (no part, that is to say, but what acts on the whole, as the whole again reacts on and through each part), yet the several parts may be detached and contemplated singly. Great as was the prostration of my powers at this time, yet I could not forget my knowledge; and my understanding had been far too many years intimate with severe thinkers, with logic, and the great masters of knowledge, not to be aware of the utter feebleness of the main herd of modern economists. I had been led in 1811 to look into loads of books and pamphlets on many branches of economy; and, at my desire, M.[argaret] sometimes read to me chapters from more recent works, or parts of parliamentary debates. I saw that these were generally the very dregs and rinsings of the human intellect; and that any man of sound head, and practised in wielding logic with a scholastic adroitness, might take up the whole academy of modern economists, and throttle them between heaven and earth with his finger and thumb, or bray their fungus heads to powder with a lady's fan. At length, in 1819, a friend in Edinburgh sent me down Mr. Ricardo's book: and recurring to my own prophetic anticipation of the advent of some legislator for this science, I said, before I had finished the first chapter, ""Thou art the man!"" Wonder and curiosity were emotions that had long been dead in me. Yet I wondered once more: I wondered at myself that I could once again be stimulated to the effort of reading: and much more I wondered at the book. Had this profound work been really written in England during the nineteenth century? Was it possible? I supposed thinking had been extinct in England. Could it be that an Englishman, and he not in academic bowers, but oppressed by mercantile and senatorial cares, had accomplished what all the universities of Europe, and a century of thought, had failed even to advance by one hair's breadth? All other writers had been crushed and overlaid by the enormous weight of facts and documents; Mr. Ricardo had deduced, à priori, from the understanding itself, laws which first gave a ray of light into the unwieldy chaos of materials, and had constructed what had been but a collection of tentative discussions into a science of regular proportions, now first standing on an eternal basis."" (Thomas de Quincey, ""Confessions of an English Opium- Eater"", Oct, 1820,  p.370-71 (1821 edition, p.99-100)
(later 1856 edition modified this passage considerably).  In 1818-9, he did a stint as an editor for the Westmoreland Magazine, before being dismissed.  De Quincey published his Confessions of an English Opium-Eater - his greatest hit - in 1820, the first a flurry of articles he contributed to the London Magazine.  Economics was one of his topics. In 1823-4, de Quincey promoted David Ricardo's work and entered into the debates then raging in economics on the theory of value and the Malthusian population doctrine.  De Quincey's ""Dialogues of the Three Templars"" (1824) are a very capable defense of Ricardian economics.  He had his reservations as well: e.g. he was never keen on the repeal of the Corn Laws and also disputed the notion that there was an ""inexorable"" tendency for profits to decline.  De Quincey's apologism for the Ricardian doctrine did not prevent the flowering of intimate friendships with its critics, notably Thomas Carlyle.  They both shared an affinity for German Romanticism. After 1825, De Quncey joined the foundling Scottish Tory rag, the Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.  He moved to Edinburgh by 1829 (although still split his time with his Grasmere cottage).  For the remainder of his life, De Quincey continued writing a fast and furious number of articles on all sorts of topics -- literary criticism, theology, philosophy, politics, etc. -- for Blackwood's and other magazines like  Tait's and Hogg's.  In 1835-38, Quincy contributed a series of celebrated biographies of literary figures (""Goethe"", ""Schiller"", Pope"", ""Shakespeare"" and, later on ""Coleridge"") for the Encyclopaedia Britannica.   All the while, de Quincey was sliding deeper into debt and trouble.  De Quincey moved to Edinburgh in 1830, but the creditors and the furies were fast at his heels.  He was convicted and imprisoned in 1831 for debts.  He was convicted twice more in 1833 and three times in 1834, forcing him to take refuge in a debt sanctuary for a time.  In the meantime, two of his sons died -- the first, aged two, in 1832, the second, aged eighteen, in 1834.  In 1837, his wife died and he was convicted twice more for debts.  De Quincy started taking opium intensely again, got into more debt and went into hiding in Glasgow.  To cap his misfortunes, another son died in 1842, during the Opium War against China.   In 1843, De Quincey, now a broken man, retired to a cottage in Lasswade.  It was here that he finished his main treatise on economics, The Logic of Political Economy (1844).  His Suspiria de Profundis, a sequel to the Confessions, were published in 1845.  In 1850, he moved back to Edinburgh and, around the same time, a pair of English and American publishers separately began putting out his collected works.  De Quincey's collected writings, widely praised,  brought him finally the ounce of joy he needed before he died.

Ugo Rabbeno, 1863-1897,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/rabbeno.htm,"19th C. Italian economist, evolutionary economist, . Originating from Reggio-in-Emilia, Ugo Rabbeno studied at the University of Bologna, obtaining his laurea in 1883, with a thesis on the evolution of labor, partly inspired by the new evolutionary ideas from Darwin and Spencer. Rabbeno subsequently spent a year in Pavia, where he came under the influence of  Luigi Cossa.  Rabbeno abandoned his Darwinian roots and launched a new research program, more reformist in goal, investigating the achievements and potential of cooperative movements.  He took several extensive research trips abroad, to France, Belgium and elsewhere, and produced studies on the cooperative movement in England (1885)  Italy (1886).  Rabbeno obtained an appointment at the polytechnical school of Bari, but remained there only a year, before moving on as a assistant professor in economics at Perugia.  He returned to Bologna three years later, obtaining the economics chair at the polytechnical institute of that city.  It was in Bologna that Rabbeno moved from theory to practice, and became more deeply involved as an organizer and promoter of the cooperatives.  Rabbeno produced a prize study on the cooperative movement (1889), and a seminal exposition of the work of Achille Loria, which he extolled with the fervor of a convert.. Ugo Rabbeno's 1893 treatise on American protectionism was controversial. Although subscribing to Friedrich List's infant industry argument, Rabbeno found latter-day ""American System"" protectionism, as advocated by Henry Carey, and later writers such as S.N. Patten, to be serving purely an isolationist agenda, and condemned it as useless, if not detrimental, to development of the American economy.. Rabbeno died at the relatively young age of 33, shortly after becoming a professor at the University of Modena.  His study on Australia was published posthumously.

Roy Radner, 1927-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/radner.htm," A student of Jacob Marschak's and the Cowles Commission, currently at New York University, Roy Radner's contributions to economics have centered around incorporating information and uncertainty into Neo-Walrasian general equilibrium theory (1967, 1968, 1972). He is also renowned for providing one of the first clear ""Turnpike Theorems"" (1961) of a von Neumann system for optimal capital accumulation and more general scenarios  His work on uncertainty and information was groundbreaking. In his 1968 classical paper, Radner incorporated and studied the impact of different information structures in an Arrow-Debreu model by defining them as different partitions in the state space. Radner (1972) integrated uncertainty and financial markets into a comprehensive Neo-Walrasian model that yielded an ""equilibrium of plans, prices and price expectations"" in a sequential economy - also known as a ""Radner Equilibrium"" - which has since found many applications in the theory of general equilibrium, finance and incomplete markets.  Radner (1967) formalized the idea of the informational role of  prices and the concept of a ""rational expectations equilibrium"" in a general equilibrium setting.  His explorations in the field have continued apace since (e.g. 1982).  His long-term work on the economics of ""teams"" -- notably his work with Marschak (1972) --  expanded upon the formal theory of information, private information and the incentives in a market economy, which set up the building blocks of principal-agent analysis and Neoclassical theories of organization.

John Rae, 1796-1872.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/rae.htm,"Scottish-American adventurer, schoolteacher and briefly economist. A Scottish shipper & shipbuilder's son, John Rae was educated at the University of Aberdeen (already after the twilight of the Scottish Enlightenment), receiving his M.A. in 1815.  He proceeded to study medicine at Edinburgh, but left without taking a degree -- apparently, his ideas about physiology contrasted too sharply with the received medical theories of the day and felt he needed further preparation to defend his thesis.  So, in 1817, Rae proceeded to Paris, where he continued his medical studies.  But, for some unexplained reason, he abandoned them and was next found touring Norway in 1818 (possibly relating to his father's shipping business) After a brief sojourn back in Edinburgh (where he married humbly), the young  John Rae emigrated to Canada in 1822 and set himself up as a schoolmaster at Williamstown,  a fur-traders' town near Montreal.  But around 1831-32, he was apparently residing in Quebec, then Montreal and, finally, Boston, Massachusetts.  Rae's stay in young upper Canada filled him with an interest about development, and he contemplated beginning one of those typical Scottish ""natural histories"" of the progress of mankind.  But he narrowed it down to economic development, which he believed was the key to the rest.   He read Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations and, perhaps informed by his Canadian observations, found it rather disappointing.  So Rae wrote his Statement of Some New Principles, which appeared in Boston in 1834 to lay out his own ideas and criticize Smith's.  Rae's work introduced some rather remarkable economic insights, made all the more astounding given how little background he had in the subject (although Rae is one of the few English-speaking economists to cite Cantillon as a source).  Against Smith's enthusiasm for free trade, Rae introduced  the ""infant industry"" argument for protectionism.  The publication of Rae's work was sponsored by New England industrialists to promote the ""American System""   The central feature of Rae's book  is his remarkable theory of capital, combining time preference and capital productivity, which anticipates the theories of Böhm-Bawerk and the Austrian School and Irving Fisher (they both generously praised Rae later).   Rae noted that a capitalist must weight the greater productivity of longer production processes against the wait for them to bear fruit.  He links the interest return -- the sacrifice of present money for future money -- on the rate of time preference, a concept he introduced and mused much about.  He also identified technological innovation (rather than sheer capital accumulation) as the key to economic development. Raw partitions classes of capital -- what he calls ""instruments"" -- into different ""orders"", depending on their ""capacity"" (output produced by that instrument), ""cost of production"" (which he measures in wage labor units) and ""time to exhaustion"". Or, more briefly, he classifies them effectively by their yield.  He measures the total supply of capital as the total capacity of all instruments.  He notes that the capacity of an instrument can be increased by two margins: by extending ""durability"" or by increasing ""efficiency"" (productivity per unit of time).  But extending capacity by either margin entails greater costs of production (i.e. more application of labor).  Soon after his book was published, Rae left Boston and headed back north to Hamilton, Ontario, where he took up a post as a headmaster in a local grammar school.  In 1837, when the Canadian rebellion broke out, Rae joined the Canadian militias and fought near the Niagara. The very next year, he was ousted by the school authorities in Ontario, ostensibly on the grounds of unorthodox thinking on religious matters.   In 1849, after his wife's death, Rae moved to Boston, then to New York, and then caught a ship to Panama.  From there, he hitched a ride to California as a ship's doctor.  California was then in the height of the gold rush, but Rae settled down as a teacher in Sutton's Creek and made gold-washing cradles and balances for the miners.  In 1851, he got itchy feet again and sailed to Honolulu and settled in Maui, Hawaii, where he worked as a schoolmaster, medical agent and district judge.  He would remain there for a while.  He died in Staten Island, New York, while visiting a former student.  This John Rae should not to be confused with his namesake John Rae, author of the Life of Adam Smith, nor the nearly contemporaneous arctic explorer John Rae, another Scottish physician-adventurer in Canada.

Karl Heinrich Rau, 1792-1870.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/rau.htm," German classical liberal economist, and long-serving professor at Heidelberg. Originating from Erlangen, Bavaria, Karl  Daniel Heinrich Rau was the son of a Lutheran pastor and theology professor at the local university.  Rau himself was educated at the University of Erlangen, obtaining his degree in 1812. Karl Heinrich Rau was a lecturer in public finance (cameralwissenschaft) at Erlangen from 1816.  In 1822, he became a professor at the University of Heidelberg for the remainder of this life.  K.H. Rau's three-volume economics textbook (Lehrbuch, 1826-37), was extraordinarily successful in Germany and went through numerous editions.   Rau is usually credited/blamed for introducing the tripartite division of German economic studies into economic theory (Volkswirtschaftslehre or Nationalökonomie), economic policy (Volkswirtschaftspolitik) and public finance (Finanzwissenschaft), a division which would prevail in German universities until the late 20th Century. By virtue of his position in Heidelberg, Rau was heavily involved in the politics and administration of Grand Duchy of Baden, and was, for a time, tutor and advisor of the Grand Duke Frederick I of Baden. Rau was a champion of the liberal movement in 19th Century Germany, and was elected to the 1848 Frankfurt assembly. Rau is often regarded as the representative of the Classical School in Germany - although his economics was closer to the French tradition of  J.B. Say than the British tradition of Ricardo.  Rau translated Storch, Say and Malthus into German.  He always reserved a special role for demand, and so may be regarded also as a proto-marginalist.  In the 1841 edition of his textbook,  Rau graphically depicted the demand-and-supply curves in their (inverted) Marshallian form (v.1, App. to §154, p.527) Rau was a strong proponent of laissez faire (e.g. 1847).  Although highly influential during the main part of his career, Rau's star dimmed later on with the ascent of the German Historical School.  K.H. Rau founded the first German economics journal, the Archiv der Politischen Oekonomie und Polizeiwissenschaft (""Archive of Political Economy and Policy Science"") in 1835.  He brought on Georg Hanssen (of Leipzig) as assistant editor in 1844.  In 1853, the Archiv merged with the Zeitschrift für die gesammte Staatswissenschaft (ZGS, a journal founded in 1844 by the Tubingen faculty).  Rau would remain on the board of the new ZGS until his death. Rau retired from Heidelberg in 1865, after over forty years of service.  Rau's professorial chair at Heidelberg was inherited by the Historicist Karl Knies.      Major Works of Karl Heinrich Rau   Resources on K.H Rau   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Frank P. Ramsey, 1903-1930.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/ramsey.htm,"  The Cambridge philosopher Frank P. Ramsey died tragically at the age of 26.  A wunderkind of first order, Ramsey had already written three important contributions to economics.  The first, ""Truth and Probability"" (written in 1926, published 1931), was the first paper to lay out the theory of subjective probability and begin to axiomatize choice under (subjective) uncertainty, a task completed decades later by Bruno de Finetti and Leonard Savage.  This was written ""in opposition"" to John Maynard Keynes's own information-theoretic Treatise on Probability.   Ramsey's second contribution was his theory of taxation (1927), generating the famous ""Boiteux-Ramsey"" pricing rule.  Ramsey's third contribution was his exercise in determining optimal savings (1928), the famous ""optimal growth"" model -- also known as the ""Ramsey model"" --  one of the earliest applications of the calculus of variations to economics.   The young Ramsey helped in the translation of Ludwig Wittgenstein's notoriously difficult Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1922) - Ramsey was also among the first to review it and even served as the great philosopher's thesis supervisor at Cambridge.   The gracious (if anachronistic) acknowledgement to Ramsey by Piero Sraffa in the preface to his 1960 Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities is a testament to the impact of the youthful scholar on those about him.  Perhaps John Maynard Keynes put it right when he said: ""When [Ramsey] he descended from his accustomed stony heights, he still lived without effort in a rarer atmosphere than most economists care to breathe"" (Keynes, 1933: p.239)      Major Works of Frank P.

Piercy Ravenstone, fl.1820s,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/ravenstone.htm,"Mysterious British author who flourished in the early 1820s. Although often classified together with the ""Ricardian socialists"", Ravenstone was not really a socialist, nor much of a Ricardian, but indeed a vehement critic of the Classical school. ""Piercy Ravenstone"" is probably merely a pseudonym of an unknown British author of two deeply pessimistic and polemical tracts in the early 1820s, against the ""cold and dreary system"" of industrial capitalism and the ""accumulating, centralising and amalgamating band of Malthusians and political economists"".

Contrary to Malthus, Ravenstone declares the wealth of a nation lies in its number of people. And the people, by their labor, inventiveness and scope for division of labor and specialization, are the source of its prosperity.   Reminiscent of Godwin, Ravenstone is not averse to technological improvements and change, he sees no deep contradictions between industrial advance and human happiness. If there is misery among the masses, Ravenstone declares, it is not because they are too many, but because of the manner in which the system is governed.

Ravenstone follows Locke in accepting a natural right to property as that which labor renders useful. But a good bulk of property, he notes, is conquered and acquired by those who do not labor upon it. The landlord, who claims rents on produce he has not labored for, is the first villain. And upon this artificial claim are the pretensions of the master manufacturer and capitalist similarly built, demanding an unearned share of earnings of labor. ""Property is in reality but a rent charge on productive Industry"" (1824). Ravenstone attacks the obsession of Classical economists with ""surplus"" as the source of growth, their acceptance of a miserable natural wage doctrine, as but an ideological excuse for these unnatural and exploitative social relations.  Prosperity and growth. Ravenstone asserts, does not depend upon them.       Major Works of Piercy Ravenstone     Resources on   Piercy Ravenstone   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
John Rawls, 1921-2002,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/rawls.htm,"  Modern Harvard philosopher.  In his most famous and influential book, Theory of Justice (1971), John Rawls proposed a new theory of social welfare.  Rawls theory is based on the the idea of ""original position"", a mental exercise whereby a group of rational people must establish a principle of fairness (such as distribution of income) without knowing beforehand where on the resulting pecking order they will end up themselves (""veil of ignorance""). Rawls used this device to argue that the optimal arrangement will be to ""maximize the welfare of society's worse-off member"".  Rawls's theory effectively justifies an egalitarian ""no-substitution"" social welfare function.      Major works of John Rawls     Resources on John Rawls   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Daniel Raymond, 1786-1849.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/raymond.htm,"Baltimore lawyer and author of  an early textbook of the ""American System"" school, arguably the first formal economics treatise by an American.. Originating from Connecticut, Daniel Raymond was educated in the Tapping Reeve School of Law in Litchfield Connecticut. Raymond moved to Baltimore in 1814 to established his law practice. Raymond wrote his Thoughts on Political Economy (1820), partly to wile away the idle hours of his law practice. Raymond was dissatisfied with British and Continental economic literature, which seemed to be too tailored to the specific structures of European economies and did not apply in the United States. Raymond dismisses the concern with distribution that had focused the attention of the British Classicals, and instead proposes to focus on ""national wealth"".  Raymond defines ""national wealth"" as the productive capacity of the economy, and separates it from the actual goods produced or property possessed  (he calls these ""individual wealth"", (p.26)).  In the main part of his treatise, Raymond argued for protectionism and government promotion of ""national wealth"".  Raymond's textbook sold out quickly, going through several more editions.  Raymond was hailed by ""American System""  Whigs, and assailed by their critics.  In 1822, Pennsylvania merchant Matthew Carey (Henry Carey's father) offered to endow a chair in political economy at the University of Maryland specifically for Raymond (the offer was ignored)   Although Raymond's influence was initially limited to these circles, Raymond would nonetheless be highly influential on authors who spent time in America during the 1820s, like John Rae and especially Friedrich List, who will carry these ideas back to Europe, and develop them further. Via this route, Raymond became very influential upon the German Historical school and, through them, the American Historicists of the late 19th Century.

Karl Renner, 1870-1950,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/renner.htm,"  Austro-Marxist primarily concerned with the problem of nationality and the sociology of law.   Originating from Moravian village (now Czech Republic), after a brief period of military service, Karl Renner enrolled at Vienna in 1891, to study law.  At Vienna, he came under the influence of professor Eugen von Philippovich and fellow student Max Adler.  After receiving his degree in 1896, Renner became a librarian in the Austrian parliament and enrolled in the Austrian Social Democratic Party (SPO).  Given his position as a civil servant, Karl Renner would write under multiple pseudonyms (Synopticus, Rudolf Springer, Josef Hammer, etc.) Karl Renner's principal contribution is his 1904 article for the Marx-Studien (later revised into a book in 1929), which remains perhaps the classic Marxian work on the role of law in society.  Renner was elected to the Austrian parliament in 1907.  During World War I, Renner broke with the left wing of the Austrian Social Democrats (Otto Bauer's group), and attempted a re-orientation of Marxian thought to account for the rise of white-collar workers and the growth of the State.   After the collapse of the Hapsburg monarchy, Karl Renner became the first Chancellor of the Austrian Republic in October 1918, presiding over one of the most difficult periods in its history.  Despite his dissatisfaction with the terms, Renner would sign the Treaty of Saint-Germain in September, 1919.  Renner grew increasingly conservative with age, although he remained with the Social Democrats.  He supported the Anchluss with Germany in 1938.  He would later become President of Austria in 1945.      Major Works of Karl Renner     Resources on  Karl Renner   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
David Ricardo, 1772-1823.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/ricardo.htm,"  The brilliant British economist David Ricardo was one the most important figures in the development of economic theory.  He articulated and rigorously formulated the ""Classical"" system of political economy.  The legacy of Ricardo dominated economic thinking throughout most of the 19th Century.   David Ricardo's family was descended from Portuguese Jews who had fled to Holland during a wave of persecutions in the early 18th Century.  His father, Abraham Israel Ricardo, was a Dutch-born stockbroker in Amsterdam who emigrated to London, England around 1760 to trade British funds on behalf of Dutch clients.  (It was after arrival in London when the long-time family surname ""Israel Ricardo"" became simply reduced to ""Ricardo"").  Abraham rose to prominence in the City of London, holding one of the twelve brokerships open to Jews on the London Stock Exchange.  He also became an active and distinguished figure among the local Sephardic Jewish community.  Abraham married Abigail Delvalle in 1769, who went on to bear him seventeen children - fifteen of whom grew up to adulthood!  David Ricardo, born on April 18, 1772, was the third of nine sons (six of whom, like David, ended up entering the stockbrokering trade in London). David Ricardo was raised in the family home on Bury Street in the City of London.  His early education is unclear and he may have been home-schooled until 1783, when David was sent to Amsterdam for a couple of years, staying with his uncle, in order to attend a school there (conjectured to have been the Talmud Torah school attached to the Portuguese Synagogue of Amsterdam). Upon his return, at the age of fourteen, Ricardo's father employed him full-time at the London Stock Exchange, where he quickly acquired a knack for the trade.  In 1793, at the age of 21, Ricardo broke with his family and his orthodox Jewish faith when he decided to marry a Quaker, Priscilla Ann Wilkinson.  According to Ricardo himself, the controversial marriage was the culmination rather than the cause, of a long-gestating breach.. A rationalist by inclination, Ricardo was already drifting away from the faith of his fathers, and flirting with Unitarianism, a Dissenting Christian sect embraced by many leading London intellectuals.   Estranged from both Jewish and Quaker communities, the young couple (Ricardo more than his wife) became attached to the Unitarian church.  They originally  set up their home in the Lambeth district of London.  They would later move to Mile End on the East End in 1803 and subsequently to Grosvenor Square on the West End in 1812.  After being cut off from his father's business, David Ricardo struck out on his own.  With the assistance of acquaintances and on the strength of his already considerable reputation in the City of London, Ricardo managed to set up his own business as a dealer (jobber) in government securities.  He became immensely rich in a very short while. Among his notable financial feats was the establishment of a consortium with John Barnes and James Steers, which went on to win the bid on the Government Loan of 1807 on behalf of the London Stock Exchange. Ricardo & Co. went on to repeat the feat (albeit partitioned with others) every year between 1811 and 1815.  In 1814, at the age of 41, finding himself ""sufficiently rich to satisfy all my desires and the reasonable desires of all those about me"" (Letter to Mill, 1815), Ricardo began to retire from city business.  Ricardo bought the former royal estate of Gatcombe Park in Gloucestershire and set himself up as a country gentleman.  In the years after 1815, Ricardo invested much of his fortune in real estate, mortgages and French stocks. (Although having wound down his brokering business, Ricardo re-emerged to submit a bid for the 1819 loan - although he lost that to Rothschild, and resigned from the Stock Exchange permanently in the aftermath)  During his stockbrokering years, Ricardo moved in various circles in London society.  He was a member of the London Institution (of which Henry Thornton was also a member) and the Geological Society (one of its earliest members and trustees).  He was a member of several prominent Whig social clubs, notably King of Clubs and Brooks's, where he mingled with rising Whig luminaries like Baron Holland, Richard Sharp, and the Edinburgh Review quartet (Francis Horner, Henry Brougham, Sydney Smith and Francis Jeffrey).  Although intellectually curious, Ricardo's earliest interests were in natural sciences (esp. geology).  Ricardo did not come across political economy until his late twenties, when he first read Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations by chance, while on vacation in Bath in 1799. Ricardo was not a prolific writer - indeed, he considered writing an ordeal and did not take to it naturally.  Bright and talkative, Ricardo discussed economic issues with his friends, and it was only at their persistent urging that Ricardo finally (but reluctantly) took up the pen.  Ricardo broke into print in August 1809, with a letter to the Morning Chronicle on the high price of gold and the depreciation of banknotes.  Back in 1797, parliament had suspended the convertibility of Bank of England notes to gold coin or bullion, leaving England effectively with a fiat paper currency parallel to its coinage.  The Bullionist Controversy had raged on-and-off since then as pamphleteers lined up to raise the alarm about the divergence of the value of paper pound from its gold equivalent and urge the resumption of convertibility.  As a leading member of the London financial community, Ricardo felt compelled to comment, authoring three newspaper articles in the Morning Chronicle in 1809 (Aug 29, Sep 20, Nov 23) subsequently evolving into a pair of tracts (1810, 1811).  Ricardo was a strong partisan of  the Bullionist position (originally articulated by James Wheatley) and blamed the suspension for rising inflation.  Ricardo urged the immediate resumption of convertibility of paper money into gold.   In preparing his arguments, Ricardo outlined what has since become known  as the  ""classical approach"" to the theory of money. Ricardo's letters had more impact than perhaps even he expected.  It led to the formation of a Parliamentary Committee under Francis Horner in early 1810 to investigate the bullion question.  The Bullion Committee's report (delivered in May 1810) largely agreed with Ricardo's conclusions and recommended resumption.  However, too late in the season for any legislative action, it would simmer for another year.   In the interval, critics took the opportunity to assail the report,.  Ricardo published a couple of pamphlets (1810, 1811) defending it, while at the same time toning down some of its more worrisome recommendations (e.g. in his 1811 reply to Bosanquet, Ricardo proposed maybe only a partial resumption was necessary) .  Nonetheless, the critics did their damage, and by the time resumption legislation was ready in May 1811, it was resoundingly defeated.  The bullion question receded quickly into the background when inflation turned around and the new worry became deflation - in particular, the rapid fall in grain prices after 1812. With Napoleon's disastrous campaign in Russia, an end to the long-running war was in sight and grain traders and farmers, anticipating a surge in grain imports in the aftermath, were selling off.  Another parliamentary committee was created, under Henry Parnell in 1813, and in its report, delivered in May 1813, it proposed a dramatic revision of the Corn Laws, setting up a protectionist system that would prohibit the importation of  grain altogether unless domestic grain prices rose above a certain high threshold (80 shillings per quarter).  Legislative action was postponed on this too, until February 1815.   It was in the hope of influencing this debate that Ricardo returned to print with his groundbreaking 1815 Essay on..Profits.   Parnell had made some elaborate economic arguments in defense of the proposed Corn Laws - in particular, Parnell tried to prove it was not merely a narrow bill to favor aristocratic landlords, pointing out recent declining share of rents on land, the prospects of agricultural improvement and concluding that the law would have no impact on long-run prices and wages nor income distribution (a hypothesis Smith had earlier articulated).  To oppose the Corn Laws, Ricardo needed to prove every one of Parnell's arguments were incorrect.  To bear against it, Ricardo's Essay introduced the differential theory of rent and the ""law of diminishing returns"" to land cultivation.  Although commonly called the ""Ricardian theory of rent"", it was not Ricardo's original invention - indeed, it had been discovered simultaneously and independently by T. Robert Malthus, Edward West and Robert Torrens (all four published their tracts within three weeks - Malthus on February 3rd & 10th, West on February 15th and Ricardo and Torrens on February 24th).  Indeed, Ricardo's Essay was explicitly a response to Malthus (who was mildly supportive of the laws), and while it is unlikely Ricardo had read West's essay, their theories were nearly identical. In his 1815 Essay, Ricardo formulated his theory of distribution in a one-commodity (""corn"") economy. With wages at their ""natural"" level, Ricardo argued that rate of profit and rents were determined residually in the agricultural sector.  He then used the concept of arbitrage to claim that the agricultural profit and wage rates would be equal to the counterparts in industrial and commercial sectors.   With his theory of distribution set up, Ricardo could show that a rise in wages did not lead to higher prices, but merely lowered profits.  The causality, Ricardo argued, went from prices to wages.  Ricardo went on to show how the proposed protectionist regime of the Corn Laws would increase food prices, raise the overall share of rents, thereby increasing the landlords' income share, and be destructive of the growth of British industry, while a free trade regime would lower prices of grain permanently, and thus lower wages, raise profits and improve growth.  Nonetheless, the Essay failed to get the politicians to change their mind - and the Corn Laws were passed in March 1815. The end of Napoleonic war in 1815 raised the value of government securities - and made Ricardo an extremely wealthy man and accelerated his retirement to Gatcombe Park. Hearing of Ricardo's new leisure,  James Mill urged his friend to dedicate his time to political economy and to put his ideas into a book. Ever anxious about writing, Ricardo was reluctant, but Mill effectively commanded him to do so, serving as Ricardo's cheerleader, editorial mentor, and disciplinarian schoolmaster all along the way.  With Mill's encouragement and guidance, Ricardo dutifully produced chapter after chapter for Mill's editorial inspection.  Mill greeted them with enthusiasm and prodded Ricardo on to swift conclusion. (Busy with his own History of British India, Mill changed very little of Ricardo's drafts - only a few stylistic recommendations here and there).  Ricardo's resulting treatise, the formidable Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, finally came out in April 1817.  It was given a glowing review by John Ramsay McCulloch in the Edinburgh Review and sold so well, that the publisher begged Ricardo for a second edition - which came out (with only minor revisions) in 1819. Arguably, a proper theory of value had been missing in the 1815 tract.  In a one-commodity model of the Essay, this is not an big issue.  But, prodded on by Malthus's criticisms, Ricardo realized that in a multiple-commodity economy, for rents and profits to remain residuals, then prices must be pinned down somewhere.  It was in the 1817 Principles that Ricardo finally articulated and integrated a theory of value into his theory of distribution.  For Ricardo, the appropriate theory was the ""labor-embodied"" theory of value or LTV, i.e. the argument that the relative ""natural"" prices of commodities are determined by the relative hours of labor expended in their production.   Indeed, Ricardo began his 1817 book by criticizing Adam Smith's  alternatives -- the ""labor-commanded"" and ""adding up"" theories of value -- because, he argued, that made value a function of wages and thus income distribution.   For Ricardo, this was untenable.  In his vision, value was independent of distribution, and thus only the ""labor-embodied"" theory made sense.  However,  Ricardo realized that when the question of capital comes in, a problem arose: specifically, as different industries apply different amounts of capital per laborer, then the rate of profit will also differ across industries.  Ricardo understood that if he then assumed that the rates of profit across different industries were equalized (as free competition would imply), then, mathematically, relative prices would now vary with wages -- exactly what he had criticized Smith for!  Ricardo realized that the labor theory of value would only work if the degree of capital-intensity was the same across all sectors, casting doubt on the generality of his cherished theory.    Ricardo proposed two ways out of this dilemma.  The first was the empirical argument that firms apply capital in a roughly proportional manner to the amount of labor invested.  In this case,  the resulting prices when profits are equalized would not differ much from the values implied by the LTV.  This is what Stigler (1958) has called Ricardo's ""93% labor theory of value"".  The second solution was to find a commodity which has the average capital per worker, so that its price would reflect labor-embodied value and thus not vary with changes in distribution.  He called this the ""invariable standard of value"" .  If one can find what this ""standard"" commodity is, Ricardo argued, then the rest of the analysis is simple.  One can, say, change technology, trace the change in value of the standard commodity, and then extrapolate the change in value for all other commodities by the degree to which their capital composition deviates from this standard.  Despite his search, Ricardo never found this standard commodity.  On his death, an incomplete paper entitled ""The Invariable Standard of Value"" was found on his desk.  Eventually, Karl Marx (1867) proposed one way out of it, but the proper solution would have to wait until Piero Sraffa (1960). A little tripped up on value, Ricardo (1817) pressed on nonetheless.  With prices (more or less)  pinned down by the LTV, he restated his old theory of distribution.    Dividing the economy into classes of landowners (who spend their rental income on luxuries), workers (who spend their wage income on necessities) and capitalists (who save most of their profit income and reinvest it), Ricardo showed once again how the size of profits is determined residually by the extent of cultivation on land and the historically-given real wage.  He then added on a theory of growth.  Specifically, with profits determined in the manner given above, then the amount of capitalist saving, accumulation and labor demand growth could also be deduced.  This, in turn, would increase population and thus bring more land, of less and less quality, into cultivation.  As the economy continued to grow, then, by his theory of distribution, profits would be eventually squeezed out by rents and wages.  In the limit, Ricardo argued, a ""stationary state"" would be reached where capitalists will be making near-zero profits and no further accumulation would occur. Ricardo suggested two things which might hold this law of diminishing returns at bay and keep accumulation going at least for a while: technical progress and foreign trade.  On technical progress, Ricardo was ambivalent.  One the one hand, he recognized that technical improvements would help push the marginal product of land cultivation upwards and thus allow for more growth.  But, in his famous Chapter 31 ""On Machinery"" (added in 1821 to the third edition of his Principles), he noted that technical progress requires the introduction of labor-saving machinery.  This is costly to purchase and install, and so will reduce the wages fund.  As a result, either wages must fall or workers must be fired.  Some of these unemployed workers may be mopped up by the greater amount of accumulation that the extra profits will permit, but it might not be enough.  A pool of unemployed might remain, placing downward pressure and wages and leading to the general misery of the working classes.  Technical progress, for Ricardo, was not a many-splendored thing. On foreign trade, Ricardo set forth his famous theory of comparative advantage.   Using his famous example of two nations (Portugal and England) and two commodities (wine and cloth), Ricardo argued that trade would be beneficial even if Portugal held an absolute cost advantage over England in both commodities.  Ricardo's argument was that there are gains from trade if each nation specializes completely in the production of the good in which it has a ""comparative"" cost advantage in producing, and then trades with the other nation for the other good.  Notice that the differences in initial position mean that the labor theory of value is not assumed to hold across countries -- as it should be, Ricardo argued, because factors, particularly labor, are not generally mobile across borders.  As far as growth is concerned, foreign trade may promote further accumulation and growth if wage goods (not luxuries) are imported at a lower price than they cost domestically -- thereby leading to a lowering of the real wage and a rise in profits.  But the main effect, Ricardo noted, is that overall income levels would rise in both nations regardless.  Ricardo's conclusions fit in well the political ideas and policy goals of the Benthamite radicals.  James Mill had been urging Ricardo to run for parliament since his 1815 retirement, and serve as their spokesman.  However, Mill was under no illusions - he knew Ricardo was incapable of running a political campaign, and must purchase a seat.  Ricardo could certainly afford it, but, as usual, he was reluctant.  But after his treatise was out of the way, Mill turned up the pressure and Ricardo finally consented.  Mill arranged it all quickly in the course of 1818, negotiating with the Whig leader Henry Brougham to arrange a ""rotten borough"" for Ricardo, while privately drilling Ricardo on the dos-and-don'ts of parliamentary debates.  Ricardo entered parliament in February 1819 as an independent representing a borough in Ireland, which he served up to his premature death in 1823.  His maiden speech was in condemnation of the Poor Laws.  In parliament, Ricardo was primarily interested in the currency and commercial questions of the day, such as resumption of convertibility (finally passed in 1819), the repayment of public debt, capital taxation and the repeal of the Corn Laws (not achieved during his tenure). Ricardo was in parliament during the economic depression that hit Britain in 1819-21.  His friend Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus had contemplated that the depression may have been caused by insufficient consumption, leading to a ""general glut"" -- an excess supply of all goods -- in an economy.   In his works, Ricardo was a firm believer in Say's Law, which asserted the impossibility of a general glut.  Production may be ill-assorted, and there may be excesses in one sector rather than another, but not an overall excess supply.  Malthus and Ricardo engaged in a vigorous debate with each other over the possibility of general gluts.  This is found in their extensive correspondence with each other, culminating in a series of notes Ricardo wrote on Malthus's 1820 Principles (these were later published posthumously as Notes on Malthus).  Ricardo stood firm in his support of Say's Law and dismissed Malthus's underconsumption thesis as theoretically impossible.  Yet, in spite of their disagreements on economic doctrines, Ricardo and Malthus took to each other personally and fostered a legendary friendship.  Ricardo even passed on investment tips to Malthus -- the most famous case being when Ricardo urged Malthus to invest in the bond market in anticipation of a British victory at Waterloo in 1815.  Ever the conservative parson, Malthus declined. Ricardo, as usual, made a killing. With his 1817 treatise, Ricardo took economics to an unprecedented degree of theoretical sophistication.  He formalized the Classical system more clearly and consistently than anyone before had done.  For his efforts, Ricardo acquired a substantial following in Great Britain and elsewhere -- what became known as the ""Classical"" or  ""Ricardian"" School.  His system, however, was improved very little by his disciples.  Arguably, only John Stuart Mill (1848) and Karl Marx (1867-94) added new insights of any great weight. Ricardo's theory was dominant through much of the 19th Century, but fell out of favor, and died a slow death soon after the Marginalist Revolution of 1871-74.  But research continued in some corners of the world, e.g. Vladimir Dmitriev (1898).  Only much later did Piero Sraffa (1960) finally solve the ""invariable measure of value"" problem and re-ignited interest in Ricardo's theory.  The ""Neo-Ricardian"" research program continues to advance today.

Paul Pierre le Mercier de la Rivière, 1720-1794.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/riviere.htm," Pierre Paul François Joachim Henri Le Mercier de La Rivière de Saint-Médard  (his full name is quite a mouthful!) was a Physiocratic philosopher and economist. From a wealthy family of Saint-Médard, Mercier de la Rivière was a magistrate and councillor in the parlement of Paris from 1747 and an intendant of the Caribbean colony of Martinique from 1759 to 1764. In the mid-1760s, Mercier de la Rivière was recruited by Mirabeau into the Physiocrat sect.  In 1767, he published his most famous work, l'Ordre naturel.  Here, Mercier de la Rivière concentrated on Physiocratic political philosophy, articulating a theory of the State in terms of ""natural"" rights and duties in a manner consistent with the laissez-faire policies recommended by the Physiocrats.  There was, he claimed, an original ""contract"" between private individuals and government, where the government's took up the duty to ""secure"" private property of individuals and in return acquired the right to a share of the produit net which it takes up in the form of taxation.  In his words, the government, by ""divine right"", has ""co-proprietorship"" of property and hence a right to a share. But, Mercier de la Rivière cautions, this share is not ""arbitrary"" and no more should be claimed than what is absolutely necessary to perform the ""natural"" functions of government (i.e. secure property).    One of his more interesting conclusions is that the laissez-faire doctrine should apply equally to foreign trade as well as domestic.  In other words, Mercier de la Rivière not only recommended that internal restrictions on commerce be lifted, but also external ones.  He argued for this in terms of the ""natural"" responsibilities of the government to the exporters and importers among its citizenry -- and that considerations of the policies of other nations should not be involved.  In other words, a nation should lift its external trade restrictions unilaterally, even if all other countries happen to have protectionist regimes. Famously, it was Mercier de la Rivière who best articulated the Physiocratic theory of ""enlightened despotism"".  In effect, he argued that the function of government was making human laws in accordance with ""natural"" laws.  Surprisingly, Mercer de la Rivière believed that republican governments are too beholden to various private interests to ever be able to govern ""well"" (i.e. according to ""natural"" laws).  An absolutist monarch, beholden to no one and owing no one, is in a much better position to do so -- although the historical record shows that they tend to govern arbitrarily and thus no better.  But he blames this arbitrariness not on a lack of will to govern well, but rather on a lack of knowledge of the natural laws.  If an absolutist monarch were ""educated"" about to the natural laws, he would be much more effective at implementing them than a republican government ever could. He paints a picture of an ""ideal"" society and holds up imperial China as the example to follow. Mercier de la Rivière's endorsement of the ""enlightened despot"", naturally, infuriated the closet republicans of Enlightenment France, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau.  The Abbé de Mably's 1768 treatise was a powerful point-by-point assault on Mercier de la Rivière's book.  Mercier de la Rivière's arguments and celebrity led the powerful Empress Catherine II of Russia to summon him to St. Petersburg in 1767 as a consultant for her political reforms.  However, he cut a very bad impression.  Mercier de la Rivière babbled on about the necessity of setting up the State in accordance with ""nature's plan"", without giving any practical legislative suggestions.  The famous exchange went reportedly as follows: Cath.: ""Sir, could you tell me the best way to govern a State well?""
M.d.R.: ""There is only one, Madame, it is to be just, i.e. maintain order, and enforce the laws.""
Cath.: ""But on what basis should the laws of an empire repose?""
M.d.R.: ""On one alone, Madame, the nature of things and of men.""
Cath.: ""Exactly, but when one wishes to give laws to a people, what rules indicate most surely the laws which suit it best?""
M.d.R.: ""To give or make laws, Madame, is a task which God has left to no one. Ah! what is man, to think himself capable of dictating laws to beings whom he knows not, or knows so imperfectly? And by what right would he impose laws upon beings whom God has not placed in his hands?""
Cath.: ""To what, then, do you reduce the science of government?""
M.d.R.: ""To study well, to recognize and manifest, the laws which God has so evidently engraven in the very organization of man, when He gave him existence. To seek to go beyond this would be a great misfortune and a destructive undertaking.""
Cath.: ""Monsieur, I am very pleased to have heard you. I wish you good-day."" Mercier de la Rivière quickly became the laughing stock of the Russian Court and quietly returned to France in 1768.  Catherine's brief interest in Physiocracy came to an abrupt and disgusted end.        Major Works of Mercier de la Rivière      Resources on Mercier de la Rivière   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Lord Lionel C. Robbins, 1898-1984.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/robbins.htm," Lionel Charles Robbins was a peculiar Englishman in the economics world of the 1920s for a very simple reason: he was not a Marshallian but rather a follower of Jevons and Wicksteed. However odd,  what really made him downwright unique in Britain was that he had actually read the Continental European economists - Walras, Pareto, Böhm-Bawerk, Wieser and Wicksell.  As a result of his Jevonian-Lausanne-Austrian- Swedish infections, Lord Robbins was instrumental in shifting the train of English economics off its Marshallian rails and onto Continental ones. Robbins's tools were the London School of Economics and a famous1932 Essay on economic methodology.  Succeeding at a young age to the unfortunate Allyn Young to the chair of the L.S.E. in 1929, the thirty-year old Robbins proceeded quickly. Among his first appointments was Friedrich A. von Hayek.  Robbins and Hayek presided over the ""golden age"" of the L.S.E. in the 1930s, breeding a new generation of ""English-speaking continentals"" such as Hicks, Lerner,  Kaldor, and Scitovsky.   Robbins's early essays were very combative in spirit, stressing the subjectivist theory of value beyond what Anglo-Saxon economics had been used to. Robbins's famous work on costs (1930, 1934) helped bring Wieser's ""alternative cost"" theorem of supply to England (which was opposed to Marshall's ""real cost"" theory of supply). His critique of the Marshallian theory of the representative firm (1928), and his critique of the Pigouvian Welfare Economics (1932, 1938), helped put an end to the Marshallian empire -- aided and abetted (and occasionally thwarted) every step of the way by his kindred spirit across the pond, Frank Knight. It was his 1932 Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science where Robbins made his Continental credentials clear. Redefining the scope of economics to be ""the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between scarce means which have alternative uses"" (Robbins, 1932). His defense of a priori theory and attack on Marshallian intuitionism is reminiscent of von Mises's essay. Robbins was initially opposed to Keynes's General Theory. Robbins's 1934 treatise on the Great Depression is an exemplary Neoclassical analysis of that period. Indeed, Robbins always saw his L.S.E. as a bulwark against Cambridge, whether it was populated by Marshallians or Keynesians. However, Robbins was eventually to recant and reconcile with the Keynesian Revolution (1947).  In the latter part of his life, Robbins turned to the history of economic thought and policy, publishing various classic studies on English doctrinal history (1952, 1958, 1968, 1970, 1976).  Although the ascendancy of the L.S.E. is foremost among his legacies, Robbins is also greatly responsible for the modern British university system - having advocated its massive expansion in the 1960s.

E. Austin G. Robinson, 1897-1993,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/austinrobinson.htm," E.A.G. (Edwin Austin Gossage) Robinson, better known simply as Austin Robinson, was a  Cambridge economist.  After a brief stint in the Royal Naval Air Service in WWI, Robinson took up a scholarship at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1919.  After a brief sojourn in India, Austin Robinson married Joan Violet Maurice (Joan Robinson) in 1926, shortly before taking up a lectureship in economics at Cambridge. Austin Robinson was elected fellow of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, and became joint editor with Harrod of the Economic Journal after 1944.  During WWII, and several times afterwards, Robinson served as an economic advisor to the British government. Together with Joan, Austin Robinson participated in J.M. Keynes's ""Circus"" at Cambridge in 1930-31.  Although he became a chronicler of the Keynesian revolution and supporter of the Cambridge Keynesians, his primary interests were in other areas.  His principal work was on expanding Marshall's writings on industrial structure and monopoly.  The current building for the economics faculty at Cambridge is named after him.

Joan Robinson, 1903-1983.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/robinson.htm,"  One of the most prominent economists of the century, Joan Robinson incarnated the ""Cambridge School"" in most of its guises in the 20th century: she started as a cutting-edge Marshallian and after 1936; as one of the earliest and most ardent Keynesians and finally as one of the leaders of the Neo-Ricardian and Post Keynesian schools.  Robinson's contributions to economics are far too numerous to elucidate fairly. Unlike most economists, she was not a ""one idea"" person, but rather made many many fundamental contributions to very different areas of economics. She was born Joan Violet Maurice in Surrey, England to a prominent but controversial family.  Her great-grandfather was Frederick Denison Maurice, one of the founders of the Christian Socialist movement, who went on to become Knightsbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy at Cambridge in 1866.  Her father, Major General Sir Frederick Barton Maurice, gained notoriety in the aftermath of World War I by accusing Prime Minister Lloyd George of misleading parliament and nation during war.   After being educated at the selective St. Paul's Girls School in London, Joan began studying economics at Girton College, Cambridge in 1921.  After a thorough soaking in Marshallian economics at the hands of Pigou and Keynes, she graduated in 1925 and, one year later, married economist Austin Robinson, then a research fellow at Corpus Christi College in Cambridge.  In 1926, the Robinsons moved to Gujarat, India, where Austin served as tutor to a young maharajah.  The bevy of local servants released newly-married Joan from conventional domestic duties, allowing her to explore India, and its economic situation in particular. She did some teaching in local schools and got involved in a research committee on Anglo-Indian economic relations.  The Robinsons returned to Cambridge in 1928, when Austin Robinson was appointed lecturer (assistant professor) of economics.  For this reason (and others), Joan Robinson was unable to obtain her own separate appointment and had to content herself with a rather informal relationship with the university.  In 1931, she finally became junior assistant lecturer in economics.  Despite her well-known abilities and achievements, she would proceed very slowly along the Cambridge academic ladder.   The Cambridge the Robinsons left behind was quite different from the Cambridge they returned to.  The economics of Alfred Marshall had been profoundly shaken by the 1926 critique of of Piero Sraffa.  Joan Robinson made decisive contributions in two directions in the hope of recasting and thereby ""saving"" Neoclassical economics: imperfect competition and general equilibrium.    Inspired by Piero Sraffa's ""pregnant suggestion"" that monopoly, rather than competition, was the ""general"" case, Joan Robinson's wrote her 1933 treatise introducing the theory of imperfect competition to economics. She showed how to handle production theory via the marginal revenue curve (introduced here by Kahn), away from the extremes of monopoly and perfect competition.  Her 1934 follow-up articles emphasized the interrelationship between the ""special case"" of perfect competition and the marginal productivity theory of distribution.  Harvard's Edward Chamberlin independently discovered the similar theory of ""monopolistic"" competition, where the emphasis was on product differentiation.  Chamberlin itched for a fight, but never got one.  Robinson was quick to move on beyond her theory - - in spite of its success in the textbooks.  The second avenue was sketched out in her famous 1941 article.  Here, she showed how ""rising supply price"" can be derived from a general equilibrium context and thus dodge Sraffa's critique (which is why it elicited so much praise from Jacob Viner). This, together with her discovery of the elasticity of substitution, were her seminal contributions to the Paretian Revival of Neoclassical economics.   Joan Robinson's early works catapulted her to the forefront of the economics profession -- but rather than follow-up on her own revolution, she decided to become the handmaiden for someone else's.  In 1930, she  -- together with her husband Austin Robinson, her intellectual companion Richard Kahn, her mentor Piero Sraffa and research student James Meade  -- formed the famous ""Cambridge Circus"" to discuss John Maynard Keynes's recent Treatise on Money.  The Circus met over the course of 1930-31.   The group's discussions were channeled to Keynes himself -- who wrote his subsequent General Theory in 1936 in light of the Circus' debates. Robinson's famous 1933 articles precipitously announced what was to come.  In the aftermath,  Joan Robinson wrote two faithful book expositions (1937a, 1937b) of Keynes's work, making her one of the main propagators of the Keynesian Revolution in economics.   Joan Robinson was appointed a full lecturer at Cambridge in 1937 and somehow found time to give birth to two daughters in the interim.  It was around this time that she came into contact with Michal Kalecki, whose own contributions seemed to have anticipated (and, in her view, superseded) Keynes's.  Prompted by Kalecki, Robinson soon set out to tackle the work of Karl Marx. Robinson's 1942 Essay was among the first studies to take Marx seriously as an economist. It effectively help draw Marxian economics from its half-chewed existence in political ideology.  Although unimpressed by the labor theory of value, Robinson identified Marx's ""extended scheme of reproduction"" as his most exciting contribution. In the 1940s and 1950s, Robinson's activities continued apace.  During the war, she had worked on various economic committees for the Labour Party and the British government.  She made several official trips to the Soviet Union, China and Ceylon. In 1949, Robinson was promoted to reader at Cambridge and settled back on her research.  Inspired by Roy Harrod and Michal Kalecki, she began thinking about the ""next step"" of the Keynesian Revolution: namely, the ""generalization of the General Theory"", i.e. extending Keynes's theory from the static short-run to the dynamic long-run (the ""Oxbridge program"").  She announced the program in her 1952 book.  In 1954, Joan Robinson produced her famous article on the problems of capital aggregation, generally considered to be the first shot in the Cambridge Capital Controversy that would rock economics in the 1960s.  In a nutshell, Robinson pointed out that when we have a heterogeneous collection of capital goods, we are forced to define the  ""quantity of capital"" in value terms.  But prices of produced goods (like capital) are determined by costs of production which are, in turn, determined by wages and profits from equilibrium in factor markets.  This is already the problem. The entire purpose of a unit of measurement of capital is to help us determine the quantity of capital demanded and supplied and yet in order to obtain this unit we already need to know its price. Hence, we are using price to determine a quantity (""capital"") that we are then going to use to determine price! The reasoning is circular. How problematic is this?  This is where Robinson provided the next few steps.  In what she called the ""Ruth Cohen Curiosum"" (Real Wicksell Effects), she showed how it could yield bizarre relationship between choice of technique and rate of profit.  This was introduced in her 1956 The Accumulation of Capital, which she hoped to be her great contribution to the Oxbridge program, to extend Keynes's theory to account for long run issues.  This was followed up by a more lucid exposition of growth theory (1962).  The concept of a variety of ""golden age"" growth paths (including Golden Rule growth -- which she called the ""Neo-classical Theorem"") were laid out.  Her work on growth paralleled and complemented that of fellow Cantabrigian, Nicholas Kaldor. Together, they developed what became known as ""Cambridge growth theory"".   During the 1960s Cambridge Capital Controversy, Robinson led the Cambridge assault on the American Neo-Keynesians, but widened her attack to assault the entire Neoclassical theory of production and distribution.  Robinson is thus partly responsible, together with Sraffa (1960), for the subsequent Neo-Ricardian or ""classical revival"" at Cambridge. Towards the end of her life, Robinson's work concentrated mostly on methodological problems in economics (notably, stressing her dissatisfaction with ""equilibrium"" theories) and trying to revive the original message of Keynes's General Theory.  Her many popular writings (1962, 1966, 1970, 1971, 1978, 1979, 1980) brought her an even greater pominence with a wider public. She was invited to address the American Economic Association in 1971, wherein she gave one of her most provocative deliveries.  An attempt to bring the Cambridge approach to a wider audience culminated in the publication of a rather unique ""principles"" textbook with John Eatwell in 1973, but it failed to make a substantial headway. Robinson was also intensely interested in problems in underdeveloped and developing countries - a natural outgrowth of her work on growth - and made substantial contributions in that direction as well. However, in later years, Robinson embarrassed many foes and friends alike with her far-too-laudatory comments of Mao Zedong and the Chinese cultural revolution. Robinson joined the British Academy in 1958 and was elected fellow of Newnham College in 1962.  In 1965, she finally became a full professor and a fellow of Girton College.  In 1979, she became the first female fellow of King's College. Her lack of a Nobel prize has been considered one of the saddest ""oversights"" of the modern economics profession - or one of the most outrageous cases of deliberate neglect. Nonetheless, the real ""prize"" is better than any Nobel: while other prominent economists drop into obscurity, her legendary works have maintained their analytical and inspirational hold on economics. A mere glance at her eclectic and voluminous collection of works remains perhaps among the better testaments to both the depth and breadth of the impact Joan Robinson had on economic theory as a whole. Despite her many contributions to high theory, Robinson never mastered mathematics.  She even relied on others (notably  Kahn) for her simplest diagrams.  In a famous incident, she declined an invitation from Ragnar Frisch in 1958 to become vice-president of the Econometric Society.  In explaining her refusal, she pointed out that she could not very well oversee a journal that she couldn't read!  Her negligence was partly motivated by her suspicion of the increasing mathematization of economics.  As she put in a favorite comment, """"I never learned math, so I had to think.""  Her occasionally acerbic wit has made her a source of several famous pithy quotes, .e.g  ""The purpose of studying economics is not to acquire a set of ready-made answers to economic questions, but to learn how to avoid being deceived by economists."" (1955) and
""economics limps along with one foot in untested hypotheses and the other in untestable slogans"" (1962). Joan Robinson died on August 5, 1983, within a month of Piero Sraffa.      Major Works of Joan Robinson     Resources on Joan Robinson.   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Julia Bowman Robinson, 1919-1985,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/schools/game.htm#robinson," Game Theory has emerged recently as a powerful challenger to the conventional method of examining economics. Although many illustrious predecessors worked on problems in what can be called ""game theory"", the fundamental, formal conception of game theory as part and parcel of economic theory were first organized in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's 1944 classic, Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944).  The main purpose of game theory is to consider situations where instead of agents making decisions as reactions to exogenous prices (""dead variables""), their decisions are strategic reactions to other agents actions (""live variables""). An agent is faced with a set of moves he can play and will form a strategy, a best response to his environment, which he will play by. Strategies can be either ""pure"" (i.e. play a particular move) or ""mixed"" (random play). A "" Nash Equilibrium"" will be reached when each agent's actions begets a reaction by all the other agents which, in turn, begets the same initial action. In other words, the best responses of all players are in accordance with each other. Game Theory can be roughly divided into two broad areas: non-cooperative (or strategic) games and co-operative (or coalitional) games. The meaning of these terms are self evident, although John Nash claimed that one should be able to reduce all co-operative games into some non-cooperative form. This position is what is known as the ""Nash Programme"". Within the non-cooperative literature, a distinction can also be made between ""normal"" form games (static) and ""extensive"" form games (dynamic). John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern (1944) introduced the strategic normal game, strategic extensive game, the concept of pure/mixed strategies, coalitional games as well as the axiomatization of expected utility theory, which was so useful for economics under uncertainty. They employed the ""maximin"" solution concept derived earlier by John von Neumann (1928) to solve simple strategic, zero-sum normal games.  In 1950, John Nash introduced the concept of a ""Nash Equilibrium"" (NE), which became the organizing concept under Game Theory -- even though the concept actually stretched as far back as Cournot (1838). Nash followed this up in 1951 with the concept of a ""Nash Bargaining Solution"" (NBS) for coalitional games. Then the floodgates opened for the refinement of Nash Equilibrium. In the field of non-cooperative games, R. Duncan Luce and Howard Raiffa (1957) provided the first popular textbook on game theory and, in it, they formalized the idea of the Iterated Elimination of Dominated Strategies (IEDS) method for Strategic Normal Games and introduced the concept of ""Repeated Game"" (static games which are played several times over). H.W. Kuhn (1953) introduced extensive games with ""imperfect information"" (i.e. where one does not know what moves have already been played by other players). William Vickrey (1961) provided the first formalization of ""auctions"". Reinhard Selten (1965) developed the concept of a ""Subgame Perfect Equilibrium"" (SPE) (i.e. elimination by backward induction) as a refined solution for extensive form games. John C. Harsanyi (1967-8) developed the concept of a ""Bayesian Nash Equilibrium"" (BNE) for Bayesian games (i.e. games with incomplete information - where there is some uncertainty surrounding moves, or where ""nature"" plays as well.) In coalitional (co-operative) games further refinements also occurred. Lloyd Shapley (1953) introduced the concept of the ""Shapley Value"" and the ""Core"" (which had been originally conceived by F.Y. Edgeworth (1881)) as solutions to Coalitional Games. Throughout the early 1960s, Robert J. Aumann and Martin Shubik began to apply cooperative game theory extensively throughout economics (e.g. industrial organization, general equilibrium, monetary theory, etc.), and, in the process, went on to invent several solution concepts for coalitional games (e.g. Bargaining Set, Strong Equilibrium), ""large games"" with infinite players and early statements of the ""Folk Theorems"" (solution concepts for Repeated Games). David Schmeidler (1969) developed the ""Nucleolus"" solution for coalitional games. Further developments emerged in the 1970s. John C. Harsanyi (1973) provided a remarkably insightful new interpretation of the concept of a ""mixed strategy"". Robert J. Aumann (1974) defined ""Correlated Equilibrium"" for Bayesian Games while Reinhard Selten (1975) introduced ""Trembling Hand Equilibrium"" for Bayesian Games. Further definitions came: Robert J. Aumann (1976) formally defined the concept of ""Common Knowledge"", opening a floodgate of literature, while B.D. Bernheim and D.G. Pearce (1984) formalized the concept of ""rationalizability"". Advancements continued apace: David M. Kreps and Robert Wilson (1982) introduced the concept of ""Sequential Equilibrium"" (SEQE) for extensive games with imperfect information.   Ariel Rubinstein (1982), following an early insight by Frederik Zeuthen (1930), transformed the co-operative Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) into a non-cooperative strategic extensive game of sequential bargaining. Elon Kohlberg and Jean-François Mertens (1986) developed the concept of ""Forward Induction"" for extensive games. Drew Fudenberg and E.S. Maskin (1986) developed one of the more famous ""Perfect Folk Theorems"" for infinitely repeated games. Finally, J.C. Harsanyi and R.Selten (1988) developed the idea of ""equilibrium selection"" for any type of game while D. Fudenberg and Jean Tirole (1991) developed the ""Bayesian Perfect Equilibrium"" (BPE) for Extensive Bayesian Games . Evolutionary game theory started its development slightly later.  Its objective is to apply the concepts of non-cooperative game theory to explain such phenomena which are often thought to be the result of cooperation or human design - i.e. ""institutions"" and ""conventions"" such as market formation, price mechanisms, social rules of conduct, money and credit, etc. One of the earliest exponents of the theory of evolutionary games was Thomas C. Schelling (1960, 1981) who argued that apparently ""cooperative"" social institutions (in this case, settlements to conflicts) are maintained by essentially by ""threats"" of punishment and retaliation  This has been followed up particularly in the 1990s.. Several Nobel Prizes have been awarded to some of major figures of Game Theory: the Nobel was shared by John Nash, J.C. Harsanyi and R. Selten in 1994 and William Vickrey and James Mirrlees in 1996. Herbert Simon won the Nobel in 1979 for concepts (e.g. bounded rationality) which have since been incorporated into the corpus of (Evolutionary) Game Theory.

Johann Karl Rodbertus, 1805-1875.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/rodbertus.htm," Johann Karl Rodbertus-Jagetzow (also known simply as ""Carl Rodbertus"") was Prussian economist and ""scientific"" socialist. Robertus was born in a wealthy Prussia family, the son of law professor at Greifswald.  Rodbertus studied law at Göttingen und Berlin and then philosophy in Heidelberg.  Rodbertus took on a variety of civil service posts, which provoked his interest in socialist and economic questions.  He was much influenced by Saint-Simon.   In 1835, the still-young Rodbertus bought the Jagetzow estate in Pomerania, and settled down to the quiet life of landed proprietor. Rodbertus dedicated himself to economics. Rodbertus's first major contribution appeared in a famous 1839 article, which was then expanded upon in his 1842 Erkenntnis book.  Here, Rodbertus picked up the Ricardian labor theory of value and deduced a rudimentary version of Marx's theory of surplus value from it, arguing that whatever value labor produces beyond that necessary for its subsistence is, in effect, a ""rent"" appropriated by the capitalist. (Rodbertus's followers would later accuse Marx of plagiarism, a charge which Engels took pains to dismiss). On this premise, Rodbertus reached the ""scientific socialist"" conclusion that workers were thus entitled to the ""unpaid"" fruits of their labor.   However, the Pomeranian landowner was no revolutionary.  Rather, Rodbertus was one of the earliest advocates of "" state socialism"", i.e. state provision for the working classes, that was later taken up by Lassalle, Wagner and the German Historical School.  The objective, as Rodbertus himself explained, was to ""save capital from itself"" -- i.e. prevent ""revolutionary"" uprisings by alleviating the ""crimes"" of private property by redistributive taxation, propping up wages, promoting agrarian reforms, etc.  He tried to put some of his reforms into practice in 1848, when he joined the Prussian Landtag, organized the Reform Party and served as a minister in Hansemann's short-lived liberal government. Rodbertus predicted the collapse of private property, but saw this as a gradual process not a revolutionary one (he estimated it would take some five centuries!).  Also notable, in a series of letters (Soziale Briefe, 1850-51), Rodbertus formulated an  underconsumption theory of crises along the lines of Sismondi.  He argued that as wages -- dominated by ""subsistence"" laws -- do not grow at the same pace as productivity, capitalism has a tendency to produce more goods than there is demand for.  The falling labor share in income, Rodbertus concluded, is the principal cause of economic crises.  State socialism, by promoting labor's share, would thus be also beneficial to the economy as a whole.

J.E.Thorold Rogers, 1823-90.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/rogers.htm," English historicist and clergyman, trained at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he obtained his B.A. in 1846 and M.A. in 1848.  After being ordained in the Church of England, he remained afterwards as curate and tutor in Oxford for the next twelve years.  In 1859, Thorold Rogers was appointed as the first Tooke Professor of Economics and Statistics at King's College London, a post which he would retain for the remainder of his life.  In 1862-67 period, he held a simultaneous appointment as Drummond Professor of Economics at Oxford University.  Although a defender of laissez-faire liberalism, Thorold Rogers's attacks on the abstractionism of Classicals in several polemical pieces which almost ruined him professionally.  His loss of the Drummond professorship in 1868 was probably due to this.  However, his scholarly reputation was restored with the appearance of his greatest work -- a massive, eight-volume quantitative analysis of prices that appeared in several installments from 1866 to 1902.  This was truly the great lodestone of the English Historical School, although his 1884 treatise was perhaps more popular. In 1888, Rogers recovered the Drummond Professorship at Oxford. Ironically, upon his death, Rogers was succeeded by the most abstract of abstract economists, Francis Ysidro Edgeworth.      Major Works of James E. Thorold Rogers     Resources on J. E.

Wilhelm Röpke, 1899-1966,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/ropke.htm," German economist and Ordo-liberal Originally from Stade, Hanover, Wilhelm Röpke served briefly and was wounded in the closing year of WWI.  He went on to study at Göttingen, Tübingen, and finally in Marburg, where obtained his doctorate in 1921. Röpke entered government service for a couple years before being appointed professor at the University of Jena in 1924. After a year in the United States on a Rockefeller foundation scholarship to analyze agricultural policy, Röpke joined the University of Graz  (Austria) in 1926, then, year later, was appointed to his old University of Marburg. Röpke wrote numerous works during this period. In 1931, Röpke served on a Braun commission on unemployment, in which he saw a role for government intervention to save the market economy, his ideas being collected in his 1932 book on the business cycles. The politically active liberal, Wilhelm Röpke had, in publications under various pseudonyms, warned the German people against the rising Nazis.  Röpke lost his post at Marburg in April 1933, soon after the Nazis came to power.  Röpke promptly fled to Turkey, where he was appointed professor at the University of Istanbul.  It was there that Röpke wrote his Economics in a Free Society, arguably his most influential work   In 1937, Röpke moved to Geneva, Switzerland, taking up a position with the Graduate Institute for International Affairs, where he would remain the remainder of his career.  Wilhelm Röpke's wartime writings (particularly his socio-economic trilogy 1942, 1944, 1945) and activities set him up as a leader of German Ordo or ""neo-liberalism"" movement.  Although remaining in his Geneva perch, Röpke served as an advisor to his former student Ludwig Erhard in the post-war German government and is commonly credited with setting up the intellectual foundations for the post-war German ""social-market"" economy.   Röpke's post-war writing focused more on denunciations of socialist planning and criticizing the Keynesian idea of a fiscal state.  In his increasingly conservative later years, Röpke came out in defense of white supremacist policies in South Africa.

George Rose, 1744-1818,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/georgerose.htm," British bureaucrat and Tory statesman of the turn of the 19th Century, and one of the chief architects of William Pitt's proto-liberal economic policy. George Rose originated from County Angus, Scotland, the son of a a prominent Scottish Tory.  His father was implicated in the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, disgraced and imprisoned - which seemed to ruin the future prospects of young George Rose.  But young George was adopted and raised by an uncle in Hempstead, England, his only relative, who enabled Rose to attend Westminster School for a spell.  George Rose entered the Royal Navy as a midshipman at an early age in 1758, and served until near the end of the Seven Years' War in 1762.  After a period in strained financial circumstances, Rose secured a government job in 1767, as a clerk in charge of printing of parliamentary records and journals, advancing to Keeper of the Records at Westminster in 1772.  In this capacity, he gained to acquaintance and confidence of several contemporary politicians, who were impressed by Rose's abilities to handle and organize large bodies information, and they eventually helped his advancement.  In 1777, Rose secured the post of Secretary to the Tax Office, acquiring an expertise in tax policy and was frequently consulted during the Tory administration of Lord North.  Indispensable, Rose was retained during the Whig administration of  the Earl of Shelburne, who gave Rose the powerful office of Secretary to the Treasury in 1782.  It was at this time that he first met Shelburne's chancellor of the exchequer, the young William Pitt, and a friendship and partnership would soon develop between the two men.  Rose followed Pitt when he resigned in early 1783 and returned with Pitt into government at the end of the year. George Rose served as Secretary to the Treasury during the entire first Pitt administration (1783-1801),. He was widely-regarded as William Pitt's principal advisor on economic policy, fiscal and financial matters, both greatly inspired by Adam Smith in their ideas.  It was Rose who originally devised the customs reform scheme, lowering tariffs and duties to combat smuggling, which Pitt put into effect early in his administration.  His 1785 tract defended Pitt's proposal for free trade between Ireland and Britain. Primarily inclined as a bureaucrat, Rose had at first resisted entering politics, but was eventually persuaded by Pitt.  Rose allowed himself to be elected to parliament in 1784 as the MP of a rotten borough (he eventually moved to a competitive seat, as MP for Christchurch from 1790).  Although never a great orator, Rose was nonetheless highly influential in the House of Commons (commonly referred to as ""Old George Rose"" by friends and foes alike).  His respected expertise made him a natural leader on economic matters. Rose's expertise in fiscal and financial matters were essential in steering Pitt's budgets and economic policies during the difficult years of the French wars of the 1790s.  Rose's deep knowledge of economic facts helped sustain Pitt during these dark days.  In 1799, in the depth of a pessimistic period when famine was ravaging the country, and everyone believed the country was on the verge of collapse, Rose issued a vitally optimistic report with evidence proving Pittite policies were working, British industry was recovering and wealth expanding.  Believing  in the absolute importance of correct facts, Rose was the principle force behind the introduction of the first British census in 1801. Rose resigned together with Pitt in 1801, and then returned as vice-president of the Board of Trade and Paymaster of the Forces during Pitt's second administration (1804-06).  After Pitt's death, Rose resigned, and sat with the opposition during Grenville-Fox's ""all-talents"" administration.  But Rose recovered his old government positions during the Pittite administrations of the Duke of Portland (1807-09) and Spencer Perceval (1809-12).  Perceval reportedly offered him the chancellorship of the exchequer, but Rose declined, believing himself too old and unfit for a cabinet post.  He remained an MP for Christchurch and held the highly lucrative posts of Treasurer of the Navy and Clerk of Parliament (despite multiple efforts by rivals to divest him) until his death in 1818.  George Rose was been most associated with the Pittite reforms in favor of the poor.  Rose had been the prime advocate of Friendly Societies - mutual  insurance schemes among working class families, providing fellowship and assistance in case of disability, health, old age and death - as an effective private alternative to the decrepit tax-financed Poor Laws.  His 1793 act to secure the formal incorporation of Friendly Societies was widely known as the ""the George Rose Act"".   The Societies were a relative success and multiplied rapidly (partly because, as the Friendly Societies were exempted from the Combination Acts, they soon become a forum for worker grievances, and served as something akin to proto-labor unions).  In the same act, Rose also secured a vital exemption from the old 1662  Act of Settlement and Removal, which had allowed parish officials to eject the newly-arrived poor from their parish on a whim - a measure long derided by Adam Smith.  Rose's 1793 act allowed Societies-enrolled poor to be exempt from deportation.  In 1795, Pitt and Rose extended this exemption to everyone, so that nobody could be deported, unless they actually applied for parish poor relief (and even so, with ample exceptions for sickness, etc.), thereby allowing the unemployed poor to move around the country in search for work, rather than being stuck in their home parish.  Pitt and Rose expanded the Poor Laws further with a 1796 act that greatly expanded benefits, legalized outdoor relief and eliminated the hated ""workhouse test"" of 1722.  As a result, workhouses were transformed from places of forced work for the unemployed into poorhouse hospices for the aged and infirm.  The generosity of the Piit-Rose Poor Laws were attacked by many critics, most famously by Rev. Robert Malthus in his Essay on Population, who called for their abolition.  As usual, Rose replied to critics with facts.  Rose organized the 1803 Poor Returns, collecting data on the parish expenses and numbers of the poor.  On the basis of these returns, Rose's wrote his influential 1805 Observations, chock full of statistics, defending the humanitarian Pittite reforms and replying to Malthus's criticisms in detail. Rose continued actively interested in the fate of the poor, spearheading studies and reforms in their favor - although Rose remained throughout more moderate than activists like Whitbread. Rose was a member of the 1817 Poor Law commission. Rose's 1810 Observations dismissing concerns about the growth of government spending during the Pittite administrations since 1780 provoked critical replies by liberals like Brougham and Bentham.  Rose supported Pitt on the Bank Restriction Act of 1797, suspending the convertibility of Bank of England notes.  Rose opposed Horner's proposal resume to cash payment during the Bullionist controversy in 1811, and was instrumental in killing it.  He also defended the British wartime trade embargoes (""Orders in Council"") against Brougham in 1812.  Rose was even more vital in fending off the Corn Laws.  His led the opposition to them on the floor of the House of Commons, and it was Rose's dogged needling of Parnell's report that killed off the first two attempts to introduce them (in 1813 and again in 1814). Nonetheless, for unclear reasons (and much to the alarm of his confederates), George Rose backed off when the Corn Bill was introduced for a third time in 1815.  Rose remained relatively quiet as it sailed through Commons.  Rose supported Pitt's 1799 income tax, and tried to preserve after 1815. One of Rose's late legislative achievements was his push for the erection of Savings Bank for the poor, a primitive form of unemployment insurance, in 1816, and introduced the bill which passed into legislation in 1817-18.  At the same time Rose opposed more active government schemes to address the economic distress of 1817.       Major works of George Rose   Resources on George Rose All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Paul N. Rosenstein-Rodan, 1902-1985.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/rrodan.htm," The Polish-born Paul Narcyz Rosenstein-Rodan was trained in the Austrian tradition at Vienna.  Rosenstein-Rodan's early contributions to economics were in pure economic theory - on marginal utility, complementarity, hierarchical structures of wants and the ever-Austrian issue of time.   From 1930, Rosenstein-Rodan was (along with Morgenstern) the editor of the Austrian journal Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie. Rosenstein-Rodan emigrated to Britain in 1930.  He taught at UCL from 1934 and then at the L.S.E. until 1947.  Rosenstein-Rodan's famous 1943 article was the progenitor of the ""Big Push"" theory of economic development.  His thesis, based on Young's famous 1928 paper, argued that given increasing returns to scale, government-induced industrialization was possible to break the poverty traps in underdeveloped countries.   Lack of domestic markets marred the incentive for a sector to mechanize by itself, and consequently there was a low likelihood that industrialization could be pulled by a single leading sector.  But coordinated investment in various sectors were undertaken simultaneously, they would generate markets for each other.  These demand spillovers would produce increasing returns and launch into self-sustained growth.  Rosenstein- Rodan's later work exhibited his continued concern with the issues of industrialization and development. Rosenstein-Rodan  moved to the World Bank in 1947.  From 1952 to 1968, Rosenstein-Rodan was a professor at M.I.T.. He subsequently moved to Texas in 1968 and then Boston University in 1972.      Major Works of Paul N.

Edward A. Ross, 1866-1951.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/eaross.htm,"American economist and sociologist. Originating from rural Illinois, Edward Alsworth Ross was part of the ""new generation"" of German-trained American economists.  With an undergraduate degree from Coe College and instructor in a commercial school, E.A. Ross went abroad for a period of study at the University of Berlin.  Upon his return, E.A. Ross obtained his Ph.D at Johns Hopkins under Richard T. Ely.  After short stints at Indiana and Cornell, Edward A. Ross was lured to serve on the faculty of the fledgling Stanford University in 1893, teaching economic theory and finance.  While a popular teacher, the outspoken Edward A. Ross, and advocate of populist causes, soon became embroiled in controversy.  A ""free silver"" man, E.A. Ross publicly endorsed the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan for the US presidency in 1896 raising the ire of Stanford's only trustee, the widow Mrs. Jane Stanford, who promptly demanded his resignation.  Stanford president Jordan resisted, but Ross earned a reprimand and demoted to sociology (where his interests had lately been gravitating towards anyway).  But Ross was not constrained, and his repeated pronouncements on public policy, notably calling for municipal ownership of urban transportation networks and immigration controls continued to pique.  Finally, an 1900 speech lambasting immigrants and use of Chinese labor on railway construction provoked Mrs. Stanford's determination to dismiss him.  Jordan attempted a compromise, but Stanford insisted and E.A. Ross was forced to resign in late 1900. The ""Ross affair"" became an early celebrated case of academic freedom.  Several Stanford faculty members resigned in protest, the public press picked up the story, and petitions from outraged academics across the country poured in (an AEA board, chaired by ERA Seligman, looked into the matter before pronouncing).  The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) was founded not long after the Ross affair, while Stanford became tainted for the next few years with a reputation for intolerance, and found it difficult to recruit new faculty as  a result.  E.A. Ross, in the meantime, found no difficulty getting a new job: he was soon hired by the University of Nebraska. In 1906, Ross moved to the University of Wisconsin as professor of sociology, where he would remain for the remainder of his career (he got embroiled in two more controversies at Wisconsin).  E.A. Ross's economic work was not of much note - after some early promise, Ross moved firmly into sociology.  Nonetheless some of his early works on public finance, and an interestingly prescient article on uncertainty (1896) are worth noting.  Throughout his career, Ross remained involved in a variety of populist progressive causes - nativism, racialism, eugenics, prohibition, etc. .      Major Works of Edward A.

Pellegrino Rossi, 1787-1848.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/rossi.htm," Pellegrino Luigi Eduardo Rossi was an Italian-born Swiss-French legal scholar, statesman and economist of the French Liberal School. Born in Carrara, Pellegrino Rossi studied at Pavia and Bologna, and embarked on a career as a prominent lawyer. His association with Joachim Murat, the Napoleon-installed King of Naples, forced him to flee Italy after the defeat of Murat in 1815, and take refuge in Switzerland. Rossi settled in Geneva, focusing on legal studies.  Despite his Catholicism, Rossi became a naturalized citizen of the Republic of Geneva, and went on to be appointed professor of civil law at the Academy of Geneva in 1820. During the early 1820s, Rossi was a close friend of Jane Marcet, then residing in Geneva, after the death of her husband.  Possibly by her influence, Rossi began teaching political economy at the University of Geneva in 1827. Rossi published his first book, on penal law, in 1829. The Swiss Revolution of 1830, Rossi was asked to draft a new constitution for the Swiss Confederation. His draft - known as the Pacte Rossi - was submitted in 1832 and approved by the Swiss federal diet, but it was rejected by the cantons in July 1833.  Disappointed, Rossi decided to accept an invitation to move to France. In November 1833, Pellegrino Rossi succeeded Jean Baptiste Say in the economics chair at the Collège de France, beating out Say's more natural heir Charles Comte. Although Comte had been nominated by the Academie des Sciences Morales, Rossi had the support of the powerful French minister François Guizot.   He became a naturalized French citizen and was appointed professor of constitutional law at the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris in August 1834, despite initially strong opposition from French students and professors.  Rossi was elected a member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques in 1836, his former rival Comte, then deathly ill, making sure to be come and cast a vote in his favor.  Rossi was ennobled in 1838 and elevated to a peer of France in 1839 by the July monarch Louis-Philippe I of France. Student notes were taken from Pellegrino Rossi's courses in economics professed at the Collège de France in 1836-37 (on production) and 1837-38 (on distribution).  The first were published as the Cours d'economie politique under Rossi's supervision in 1840-41.  The latter were published posthumously by his son in 1851 and 1854.  Notes were not taken on the third course delivered 1838-39 (on history of economic thought), although fragments of notes were later published in Melanges (1857). Pellegrino Rossi was the founder and first president of the Société d'Économie Politique, the first French society of political economy in 1842, although the  original organization was absorbed by the society founded by Joseph Garnier, Guillaumin, et al. Interrupting his academic career, Pellegrino Rossi was dispatched to Italy by the July Monarchy in 1845 as the French ambassador to Rome.  He was instrumental in the election of Pope Pius IX in 1846 and stayed on in Rome semi-officially as a favorite papal advisor.  Pope Pius IX relied on Rossi's guidance during the Springtime of the Peoples, and Rossi helped the pope introduce liberal reforms and constitutional government into the Papal States.  Pope Pius IX finally appointed Pellegrino Rossi as minister of interior and finance, and de facto prime minister of Papal States in September 1848.  However, Rossi's commitment to maintain a constitutional monarchy and avoid war with Austria roused opposition from radical republicans.  Pellegrino Rossi was assassinated by Roman republicans at the opening of the papal parliament on November 15, 1848.  Rossi was stabbed to death in the atrium of the Palazzo della Cancelleria, in full view of the public and guard, who did not intervene, and let him bleed to death and his assassins escape.  The circumstances of Rossi's assassination frightened Pope Pius IX, and prompted the pope to makes his escape from Rome one week later.  A severe constitutional crisis followed that ended up with the deposition of the Pope and the proclamation of the Roman Republic in 1849.

Walt Whitman Rostow, 1916-2003,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/rostow.htm," Economic historian and articulator of a linear stages theory of economic development with his 1960 booklet, Stages of Economic Growth. The son of Russian Jewish immigrants in New York, Walt Whitman Rostow obtained his Ph.D. at Yale in 1939 (with a stint as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford in between).  Rostow subsequently served as an economics instructor at Columbia until the outbreak of the war.  During WWII, Rostow served as an officer in the OSS (ancestral to the CIA) in Washington.  He returned to academia after the war.  After brief periods at Oxford in 1946 and Cambridge in 1949, Rostow became professor of economic history at MIT in 1950. Outside of economics, W.W. Rostow became a political adviser to the US presidents John F. Kennedy  and Lyndon B. Johnson.  After serving as Kennedy's campaign strategist in 1960, Rostow became a state department official and later national security adviser during the Vietnam War, and was reputedly instrumental in increasing US military involvement there.  He later taught at the University of Texas at Austin. Rostow's 1960 linear stages theory of development argued that all developing countries must pass through five distinct stages: (1) ""traditional society"" (subsistence agriculture, next to no savings or investment), (2) ""preconditions for take-off"" (agriculture becomes mechanised, surpluses emerge, savings begin to grow to about 5% of GDP), (3) ""take-off"" (manufacturing grows, political institutions develop, savings rates increase to 10-to-15% of GDP); (4) ""drive to maturity"" (savings steady at 10-20%, growth spreads to other sectors, technological improvement, increasing diversity), (5) ""age of mass consumption"" (output driven by consumption, beginning of shift to tertiary sector). Rostow envisaged the length could take forty to sixty years from take-off to maturity. The theory was criticized for its ""one-size-fits-all"" approach - and in particular, the centrality of savings, which was not always evident at the rates Rostow assumes and for overlooking the importance international trade and competition.

Abbé Pierre-Joseph-André Roubaud, 1730-1789,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/roubaud.htm,"French cleric and prolific Enlightenment journalist, allied with the Physiocrats.

In 1759, the Abbé Roubaud and partner Le Camus founded and edited the Journal de Commerce, one of the first French business newspapers, published in Brussels. It was closed in 1762. The newspaper was re-launched in January 1765 in Paris, under a new title Gazette du Commerce.  Alongside it, the Gazette produced a monthly supplement of weightier articles, known as the Journal de l'agriculture, du commerce et des finances.  Later that year, the young Pierre Samuel Dupont de Nemours was appointed the editor of the JdACF and transformed it into the mouthpiece of the Physiocratic school.  This lasted for about a year and a half before the Gazette director Thomas-François de Grâce dismissed Dupont and re-oriented it towards the Neo-Colbertistes.  The Abbé Roubaud took over the Gazette and JdACF from de Grâce in 1770.  Roubaud began editing it himself, re-orienting it back towards the liberal camp, until it was suspended in December 1774.  Besides the journal, the Abbé Roubaud's main contributions to  Physiocracy consist in largely criticizing critics.  Through a series of letters in the Gazette in 1770, Abbé Roubaud took the leading in refuting Galiani's Dialogues.  In 1774, Roubaud took up the pen in a debate via public letters with the anti-physiocrat S.M.H. Linguet.  After penning several attacks on policy abuses of the Maurepas administration, Abbé Roubaud was exiled in 1775 (along with Abbé Baudeau). Both returned the next year by the good offices of Jacques Necker. An opponent of colonialism and the slave trade, Roubaud authored a vociferous critique of the East India companies (1768), especially the British one, denouncing their transition from commercial companies to imperialistic, political and rent-seeking institutions (note that this is before the Hastings impeachment or the revelations of British misrule in India). He also composed a massive multi-volume history (1770-75) of Asia, Africa and America.      Major Works of Abbé Roubaud     Resources on  Abbé Roubaud     All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 1712-1778. ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/rousseau.htm," Swiss musician, writer and political philosopher of the Enlightenment era. The details of Rousseau's life are well-known (if a bit embellished) from his Confessions. Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a native citizen of the Republic of Geneva.  His mother died in childbirth and he was initially raised by his father Isaac, a watchmaker of Calvinist faith, and an aunt.  After an idyllic early childhood, Rousseau was suddenly orphaned at ten (more-or-less - his father ran off to Istanbul and was never heard from again).  Rousseau stayed with relatives until he was  apprenticed to an engraver, who treated him cruelly. In early 1728, at the age of sixteen, Rousseau finally ran away from Geneva and wandered around. He eventually made his way to Annecy (in Savoy, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont), where he was taken in by the Madame de Warens, a bored provincial lady who apparently made it her mission to convert wandering Calvinist boys to Catholicism.   She dispatched him to a Catholic hospice in Turin  for religious instruction - and once he converted to Catholicism, Rousseau was duly given twenty francs and sent on his way.  His conversion implied losing his Genevan citizenship.  Rousseau briefly found work as a servant for a lady in Turin for a spell, but was soon fired for stealing.  A local Savoyard curate took pity on the young vagabond and found him a place in another noble family, but Rousseau set off wandering again, and was soon back in Annecy with the Madame de Warens in the Fall of 1729.  She arranged for his music instruction - which quickly became a great passion for Rousseau.  But more youthful escapades soon followed.  In April, 1730, Rousseau was sent with his tutor on a mission to Lyons by the Madame de Warens.  But along the way, Rousseau decided to give his tutor the slip and proceeded to go rambling around by himself.  He went through a new set of adventures - gave a concert at Lausanne, hooked up with a Greek confidence man, was nearly arrested in Bern, escaped with the help of a French diplomat, etc. Around 1733, Rousseau  finally returned to Annecy and the care of Madame de Warens.  She now took Rousseau on as a lover, and arranged a bit of a living as her secretary and a music tutor.  Eventually, in late 1735, tiring of being just a plaything, Rousseau persuaded de Warens to set him up in a isolated rustic cottage at Charmettes near Chambéry.  There he sat down with piles of classics and scientific books, and finally began to acquire his only real education.  The solitary idyll in the country cottage came to an end a few years later, in 1741, when Rousseau was hired by a local noble as a tutor for his son (the young Abbé de Mably).   After a year of commendable service in the Mably household, Rousseau moved to Paris in 1742, armed with letters of introduction, hoping to peddle a new system of musical notation he had invented to the Paris Conservatory and the Académie des Sciences (he failed).  Rousseau found employment as the secretary to the Comte de Montaigu, the French ambassador to Venice, and traveled with him to Italy.  Rousseau was in Venice for only a little while before he quarreled with his employer and was fired. Rousseau had to flee Venice to avoid arrest.  The details of this affair are murky, but significant. Apparently the Comte swindled Rousseau out of some money, and Rousseau would spend years trying to get it repaid.  His own friends in high places showed little sympathy for his case against the ambassador and suggested he drop the matter.  Apparently, the experience embittered Rousseau greatly, and fed his growing hostility towards the French noble elite that would later find an outlet in his writings.    After leaving Venice, Rousseau returned to Paris to attend to his principal passion, music composition.  His first effort, the operatic ballet Les Muses Galantes (written 1743 and produced privately) fell flat. It was during this time (c.1745) that Rousseau picked up a poor mistress, Thérèse de Levasseur, an illiterate servant maid who would remain his companion for the rest of his life (Rousseau would abandon their five children to foundling homes; he only got around to marrying her 23 years later - in 1768).  Rousseau's musical merits gave him entry as secretary and tutor into the Dupin household in 1745.  Through the Dupins, Rousseau quickly fell into the philosophes circle - Diderot, Voltaire, d'Alembert, etc. - and reconnected with his former pupil Mably and his brilliant younger brother, Etienne de Condillac. Diderot and d'Alembert recruited Rousseau to contribute many fine articles on music to their Encyclopédie, which started to appear in 1749.  Rousseau also wrote the article on ""Économie"" for the fifth volume (1755), but it was little more than a hack job.  Rousseau eventually go to know the Physiocrats themselves (Quesnay, Mirabeau, Turgot, etc.), although he was apparently not very enthused by them.  Although music was his principal vocation, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's claim to fame is as a political and social philosopher.  His first effort was his fiery Discourse on Arts & Sciences (1750), written as a submission to a competition at the Academy of Dijon. According to Rousseau, he was on his way to visit Diderot in prison in Vincennes in October 1749, when he came across a prospectus for the competition in the Mercure magazine.  Rousseau claimed he developed his entire philosophical vision and system of thought en route to Vincennes (""I beheld the universe and became another man"", Conf., Bk. 8, p.228).  To the Dijon Academy's question - ""Whether the reestablishment of the sciences and the arts has contributed to purifying morals"" -  Rousseau's answer was ""no"". Intellectual and scientific progress, Rousseau declared, has only encouraged moral corruption and the decline of civic virtue.  The Discourse won the Academy's prize in August 1750, and went on to be published.  Rousseau's challenge to the Enlightenment's central conviction - faith in progress - provoked a debate, and there was a lively engagement and interchange with his critics in the course of 1751.  The success encouraged Rousseau to leave the employ of the Dupin family in Paris in 1751 and strike out on his own, eking out a living as a music copyist, a profession he would maintain for the remainder of his life.  Rousseau found further success with his small comic opera Le Devin de Village, which was played before King Louis XV at Fontainebleau in June 1752 (a contemporary parody of the opera, Bastien and Bastienne, would be later re-composed by Mozart in 1768).    Inexplicably, Rousseau turned down the offer of a royal pension from the amused king. The Devin would go on to be well-received at the Paris Opera in March, 1753, but that same November Rousseau fell into polemics with his Lettre on French music. Rousseau waded into an intense debate in music circles on the relative importance of melody and harmony.  Rousseau lauded the superiority of Italian over French opera (the latter represented by French composer Rameau).  French musicians did not take it kindly, and Rousseau would be burned in effigy by the orchestra of the Paris Opera. Tiring of France, Rousseau returned to Switzerland in 1754, resumed his Calvinist faith and re-acquired Genevan citizenship.  During this time, Rousseau wrote his second Discourse on Inequality, for another competition held by the Dijon Academy.  It would not win the prize this time, but Rousseau went ahead and had it published in April, 1755. It would be the more significant of the two discourses.  The second discourse elaborated on Rousseau's famous vision of the state of nature and natural man, the ""noble savage"".  Rousseau envisions man in his natural state to be inherently calm, humble and pacific (not necessarily moral, merely torpid and dull).  Rousseau identifies the invention of private property as the moment of transformation.  Private property introduces inequality in wealth, social distinction, hierarchy, power and eventually leads to the creation of the State.  As a consequence, man becomes transformed into a social being, and his personal character is deformed - he becomes snobbish, heartless, immoral and violent, i.e. ""civilized"".  Rousseau's thesis on inequality, now considered a milestone of the  Enlightenment, raised eyebrows in philosophical circles, both inside France and abroad (the young Adam Smith took notice of it in his Edinburgh Review in 1755 (July, p.130)).  Rousseau returned to France in 1756 and in April, deciding to live closer to nature, moved to the small country house of L'Hermitage in the valley of Montmorency (a few miles north of Paris), offered by the Parisian salon mistress Madame d'Epinay.  There, Rousseau sat down to sift through the manuscripts of the late Abbé de Saint-Pierre.  But around this time Rousseau also got into conflicts with the philosophes, quarreling with Diderot, d'Alembert, Grimm and finally d'Epinay herself.  In 1757, Rousseau broke with the philosophes, and moved to another house (Montlouis,  also in Montmorency).  This was among the more productive periods of his life, where he composed the bulk of his next few works. In the interim, Rousseau provoked the theatrical world with his Letter to d'Alembert (1758) denouncing the theater as a corrupting influence, severing individuals from their social milieu.  He would return to Paris in 1759. During his seclusion in the French countryside, Rousseau wrote his famous epistolary romantic novel, La Nouvelle Heloise, which was published in early 1761. Its title invokes the Medieval story of Abelard and Heloise, set in rural villages around Lake Geneva.  It is a story of the forbidden love affair between a middle-class tutor Saint-Preux and his aristocratic pupil Julie, their forced separation, and Julie's marriage to Wolmar, a practical nobleman.  The contrast between passion and reason, romance and social expectation, are among the themes Rousseau draws out in the novel.  The novel was an immediate and massive success. It was unscrupulously pirated by publishers, and went on to become probably the best-selling novel of the 18th Century.  Rousseau's novel had a profound influence on the literary scene in France, breaking the arid neoclassicism that had prevailed until then, and opening the new phase of romantic literature. That same year (1761), Rousseau completed a tract on the origins of language that he had begun back in 1755 as a derivative of his second discourse.  The French censor Malesherbes recommended it for publication, but Rousseau had two other works he wanted to put out first.  The essay on language would end up unpublished in his lifetime. Emboldened by the success of his novel, Rousseau published two new books in the Spring of 1762 that would change his fate.  The first book was Du Contrat Social (April, 1762), Rousseau's most systematic political opus, following up on his second discourse . The famous opening phrase of its first chapter - ""Man in born free, and is everywhere in chains"" - can be justly regarded as a synopsis of Rousseauvian philosophy. Through the tract, Rousseau ranged against divine right, articulated the doctrine of the popular sovereignty, with governments as merely servants of the general will.  The second book, published a month later (May, 1762), was Émile, ou de l’éducation, deriding the corrupting influence of human agency (""All is good when it leaves the hands of the Creator, all degenerates in the hands of man"") and outlines a system of education for children that would allow the flourishing of ""natural man"".  This drew a firestorm.  He got in trouble primarily for a passage in the latter, known as the ""Creed of a Savoyard Priest"", on revealed religion, which was perceived as articulating the Socinian heresy (unitarianism).  Rousseau was condemned both by the Catholic authorities in Paris (June 9) and the Calvinist authorities in Geneva (June 19). Orders were issued for Rousseau's arrest and his books were burned throughout France and Switzerland.  Rousseau fled France in the nick of time - initially to the domains of the canton of Berne in Switzerland.  But the Bernese authorities quickly expelled him.  In July 1762, the hunted Rousseau finally found refuge in Môtiers, in the canton of Neuchâtel, then ruled by Frederick II the Great of Prussia.  Shortly after arriving, Rousseau wrote his Letter to Beaumont, answering the censure of Christophe de Beaumont, Archbishop of Paris.  Rousseau would remain exiled in Moitiers for the next three years. Rousseau renounced his Genevan citizenship in 1763. In November 1764, while ensconced in his Neuchatel haven,  Rousseau wrote his polemical Letters from the Mountain, a passionate defense of his social contract, in response to a Swiss critic Jean Robert Tronchin, a member of Geneva's oligarchic council.  The fury of Rousseau's tract, attacking the political legitimacy of the Genevan government, was shocking and drew more enemies.  Even the hitherto-sympathetic Voltaire felt compelled to join ranks against him, and published a pamphlet on it (in the course of which Voltaire publicly revealed how Rousseau had abandoned his own children).  Reaping the whirlwind, Moitiers was soon not safe anymore. In September 1765, a local pastor preached a fiery sermon against Rousseau, and a mob of his parishioners stoned Rousseau's house in Moitiers.  Shaken, Rousseau moved to the apparent safety of the Island of Saint-Pierre in the Lake of Bienne. But the island lay within the jurisdiction of Berne, and the Bernese authorities ordered his expulsion again.  In late October, 1765, Rousseau left Switzerland and made his way to Strasbourg, uncertain of where to go next.  He received invitations from various well-wishers - Frederick II invited him to Potsdam, publisher Michel Rey invited him to Amsterdam, Pasquale Paoli invited him to Corsica and David Hume invited him to England.  Rousseau decided to take up Hume's offer.  Through the efforts of some friends in high places, Rousseau managed to secure safe-passage through France, and would spend a couple of weeks in Paris in December 1765, hosted by  Louis François, Prince of Conti.  His stay in Paris was brief but eventful.  His old enemies of the philosophes clique (mainly Encyclopedistes D'Holbach, d'Alembert, Diderot, Grimm, etc.) engaged in raillery at his expense, and tried to intrigue with the arriving Hume. English playwright Horace Walpole, then in Paris, authored a notorious fake letter, pretending to be Frederick II of Prussia, satirizing Rousseau's fear of persecution, which was soon circulating among chuckling readers in Paris and London [repr. in MacDonald]. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, accompanied by David Hume and a merchant De Luze, arrived in England on January 13, 1766.  Rousseau initially moved into a house in west London. But two months later, on March 22, against Hume's advice, Rousseau left London and moved to a country estate in Wootton (rural Staffordshire), offered by a local gentleman Richard Davenport, an English fan of Rousseau's works (Rousseau and Hume would not meet again in person).  It is at Wootton that Rousseau began writing his ""Confessions"".  Rousseau's bitterness and paranoia eventually wore down David Hume, and they soon had a falling out.. While away in the English countryside, Rousseau had instructed Hume in London to manage his incoming mail, and forward him only the important letters.  But when articles critical of Rousseau appeared in the British press, the paranoid Rousseau began suspected Hume was their unnamed source.  When the scurrilous Walpole letter was published in London in the St. James's Chronicle (Apr 1), owned by William Straham (a publisher friend of Hume's), Rousseau chided the Scottish philosopher for not standing up for him.  A series of testy exchanges between Rousseau and Hume followed in June, culminating in a furious letter from Rousseau (July 10, 1766, repr), unloading his griefs against Hume, accusing him (among other things) of tampering with his mail and leaking its contents to the press.  The quarrel got wider as Rousseau and Hume wrote to their circle of friends (both in Britain and France), complaining about each other. Hearing that Rousseau was writing his ""Confessions"", Hume anticipated their quarrel would figure in it, and decided to set the record straight in advance. Urged by the French Enlightenment clique (D'Alembert,Turgot, etc.), always ready for intrigue, - and against Adam Smith's advice - David Hume decided to take the quarrel public, and published their correspondence, first in French in Paris (Oct) and then in English (Nov).  The Hume-Rousseau quarrel would become a sensation throughout Enlightenment circles in Europe, with other figures chiming in with their own take on it.  Rousseau decided not to reply to Hume, and instead arranged to leave England.  Rousseau arrived in France on May 22, 1767 under an assumed name (""Jean-Joseph Renou""). But it fooled nobody - shortly after his arrival, he was received with a public banquet in Amiens. Rousseau initially took up an offer of refuge at the chateau of Fleury (near Meudon, southwest suburbs of Paris), hosted by Victor Riquetti (Marquis de Mirabeau), who hoped to convert the celebrity writer to Physiocracy (Lavergne, p.338).   Mirabeau had Rousseau read Mercier de la Riviere's recent tract, Ordre naturel, but Rousseau found it tiresome and regarded the Physiocratic embrace of legal despotism off-putting.  Extracting himself from his obnoxious host, Rousseau subsequently (June 21) moved to the more rural Chateau de La Trye (north of Paris), offered him by Louis François, Prince of Conti.  From La Trye, Rousseau completed and published his Dictionary of Music, which he had been working on for years. Technically still a fugitive, Rousseau descended deeper into paranoia. Rousseau left La Trye a year later (June 1768), going on to Lyons.  He moved thereafter to Bourgoin (in the Dauphiné), where Rousseau finally officially married his long-suffering companion, Thérèse Levasseur (August, 1768).  In January 1769 they moved to Grenoble, where Rousseau resumed work on his ""Confessions"".  In April 1770, they returned to Lyons, where Rousseau's dramatized poem Pygmalion was given a public performance.  Rousseau finally moved back to Paris in June, 1770 - returning to the city he had fled in 1762.  He would remain in Paris, living in poverty as a music copier, for the last eight years of his life.   Rousseau's Confessions were completed by November 1770, but he decided to delay publication.  Instead, over the next six months, Rousseau gave public readings of his text to gatherings around Paris.  The affronted Madame d'Epinay, who figured large in the memoirs, used her connections to have the Paris chief of police shut them down in May 1771 and forbid further readings. By that time, Rousseau was deeply engaged in another project, Considerations on the government of Poland, his last political tract, begun in October 1770 and completed around June 1771.  Although tailored for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, some of it it applied to government generally. Curiously, Rousseau backed away from the direct democracy implied by the Social Contract and now advocated the merits of a representative system, with frequent elections. He found the Polish Senate too powerful, and recommended them being reduced and/or appointed by the Diet.  Overall, finding the country too extensive, Rousseau recommends breaking up Poland into a collection of small self-governing cantons (in whatever local form - monarchical, democratic, etc., so long as the citizens ""know each other"").  But Rousseau's tract was still unpublished when Poland was overwhelmed by war and partition in early 1772, rendering its recommendations mute.  It would only be published posthumously.  With his Confessions confined in cold storage by police order, Rousseau still felt a need to find a way to salvage his reputation. In 1772, Rousseau began a second autobiographical work, Rousseau juge de Jean-Jacques, in the form of three dialogues, defending himself from his critics. Wandering and disorganized, the dialogues evince signs of mental breakdown from the impoverished and sick Rousseau.  Completed in February 1776, the mentally distraught Rousseau attempted to deposit the manuscript at the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, only to find it barred by a gate.  His paranoia at its apex, Rousseau refrained from publishing the dialogues, and instead entrusted copies to Etienne de Condillac and Brooke Boothby.  Around this time, Rousseau's erstwhile protector, the Prince of Conti, died (August 2), and with him (Rousseau imagined) all remaining hopes for rehabilitation. In the aftermath (September 1776), Rousseau began his third autobiographical work, Reveries of a Solitary Walker, the most introspective of his works. He would not live to complete it. At the invitation of the nobleman Stanislas de Girardin, Rousseau left Paris in April 1778 to stay in Ermenonville, hoping to recover his health.   Jean-Jacques Rousseau died in Ermenonville on July 2, 1778.  There were rumors after his death that he had committed suicide or was poisoned by his enemies, but none of that was ever substantiated.  Rousseau's remains, originally entombed in a lake island in Ermenonville, were moved to the Pantheon in Paris in 1794. Rousseau's posthumous works began to appear shortly after his death. Boothby arranged for the publication of Rousseau juge de Jean-Jacques in 1780.  The first part of the Confessions, along with the Reveries, were published in 1782, the second part of the Confessions were published in 1789.  The publication of the Confessions revived public interest in Rousseau, and new editions of  his collected writings began to put out by publishers, ensuring widespread familiarity with his works on the eve of the French Revolution in 1789.  Jean-Jacques Rousseau's political writings had enormous impact - most immediately during the French Revolution, during which his name and ideas were invoked repeatedly.  Rousseau's work would also inspire numerous socialist writers and movements of the 19th Century. Rousseau's impact on economics is more elusive. Jean-Jacques Rousseau made only one explicit contribution to economics: the article ""Économie"" in the fifth volume (1755) of the Encyclopédie of Diderot and d'Alembert (later reprinted as a Discourse on Political Economy). The article contains no obvious economic theory and is merely a pre-taste of the political philosophy he was to lay out in his Social Contract (1762). His earlier polemical Discourse on Inequality (1754) - which argued that civilization had destroyed man's ""natural goodness"" and that the invention of private property was the source of all social, political and economic inequality - had some impact on economics, and is prescient of later Marxian doctrines. However little direct influence, Rousseau's work nonetheless had a substantial indirect impact on economics. In particular, Rousseau initiated (or certainly promoted) among his fellow Enlightenment philosophers the intellectual artifact of a ""natural state"" of society.  This extended to social equilibrium and lent itself to ""natural value"" concepts which were very much ingrained in the thinking of the Physiocrats and Adam Smith. His appeal to this state via his ""natural man"", the ""noble savage"", is reminiscent of the analogies formed in modern economics (think of Robinson Crusoe). However, Rousseau did not push that idea as an analogy to the existing world - as so many economists did and still do. Rather, a thorough pessimist about existing human society, Rousseau recognized that this ""natural state"" was perverted by ""civilization"" and that the appetites and motivations of civilized man had been consequently corrupted and constructed by his interaction with society, making him also ancestral to Institutionalists. Rousseau's principal drawback - and the one focused on by his critics - was his lack of specificity.  Rousseau does not locate it in historical circumstance - he jumps from state of nature to civilization in one leap, where others (e.g. Scottish writers and later Historicists and Marxians) preferred gradual evolutionary stages, embedded in actual history.  He also has little practical political advice to give - the state of nature is unrecoverable, property exists, civilization exists and he lays out no blueprint for their abolition. One can only emulate what was lost, e.g. in education and in political systems, as far as possible.  But in the 1790s French Revolutionary radicals (and English ones, such as William Godwin) saw a manifesto for wholesale political and social reform to bring the ""natural state"" about.  In its ultimate manifestation, they envisioned not Hobbes's ""equilibrium"" of competing wants, but rather a collective state with extra-personal dedication to a ""General Will"". Only in such a state, as per Rousseau's assertions, could the true ""natural man"" re-emerge and be truly free. It is these last observations that make Rousseau the putative father of Socialism (utopian and otherwise).

"Benjamin Thompson, Count of Rumford", 1753-1814,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/rumford.htm,"American-born Enlightenment scientist, civil servant and social reformer, a forebearer of Malthus on Originally from Woburn, Massachusetts, Benjamin Thompson, descended from an old New England family.  His father died shortly after his birth, and he was apprenticed at a young age to a wholesale merchant in Salem, and later to a dry goods dealer in Boston.  While a teenage apprentice, Benjamin Thompson is reported to have been among the riotous crowd at the Boston Massacre in 1770.  He was released from his apprenticeship shortly after.  Interested from an early age in mechanics, he undertook a program of self-study in science, occasionally attending lectures at nearby Harvard college.  For a living, he tried his hand at teaching, and eventually wound up as a schoolteacher in Concord, New Hampshire (the town of Concord was originally called ""Rumford"", from where he would adopt the name of his later imperial title).  In 1772, the penniless young Thompson married a local wealthy widow Sarah Walker thirteen years his senior, and catapulted in social standing and comfort.  Through his wife's contacts, the ambitious nineteen-year-old Thompson was commissioned as an officer by the British colonial governor of New Hampshire, which earned the resentment (and suspicion) of other American officers. Benjamin Thompson became a loyalist during the American Revolutionary War which broke out in 1775.  He was evacuated from Boston in 1776 with the rest of the British garrison and made his way to England at the age of 23, leaving his wife behind.  Due to his intimate knowledge of New England, Benjamin Thompson was hired by the Sir George Germain, Secretary of State for Colonies.  He proved himself an able administrator, and rose quickly in colonial office ranks, reaching undersecretary of state.  During his time in London, Thompson also delved into military science, undertaking experimental inquiries into the efficiency of gunpowder, ballistic velocity and cannon bores.  He was elected a member of the Royal Society in 1779. At the dismissal of Germain and the dissolution of the Colonial Office in 1782, Thompson returned to the army as a cavalry officer with the rank of colonel, and was dispatched to America.  He helped reorganize the remains of the loyalist regiments in South Carolina, and then moved up to Long Island, New York to take charge of the loyalist dragoons.  But the loyalist cause was by then irretrievable, and Thompson did little more than stay put in Flushing, annoying the locals, for a year, before being evacuated again back to Britain.  Now 31, and still hungry for adventure, Thompson left England to serve as a soldier of fortune on the continent in September 1783.  He proceeded towards Vienna, hoping to volunteer for an imminent Austro-Turkish war.  The war, however, was not happening, so he found his way into service of the Elector Charles Theodore of Bavaria in 1784, who was promptly taken by his personality and ideas.  Benjamin Thompson would remain in Bavaria for the next eleven years in a variety of military and civil posts.  The Elector of Bavaria appointed Thompson his aide-de-camp, and then commander-in-chief of the Bavarian army and eventually minister of interior and still later prime minister of Bavaria.  Thompson would be invested as the imperial ""Count of Rumford"" (HRE title, ""Reichsgraf von Rumford"") in 1792, choosing the old name of his hometown in New Hampshire for his title. A scientifically-minded Enlightenment type and meticulous administrator, in the space of a decade, Benjamin Thompson (Count of Rumford) left an indelible imprint upon Bavaria in general, and Munich in particular.  Backed by the full confidence of the Elector, Benjamin Thompson-Rumford overhauled the Bavarian military, then decrepit and demoralized mess.  He established military academies, children's schools and military manufactories. To improve recruitment and morale, he raised soldier's pay, improved rations, established smaller garrisons nearer to soldiers' homes, with regimental gardens to focus idle soldiers' attention during off-hours.  Rumford also deployed the army's resources towards civic improvements, designed new model houses for the people  and laid out the suburbs of Munich in line with Enlightenment ideals, rationally arranged, letting in light and air, and with gardens for recreation and cultivation  (Rumford was arguably responsible for the introduction of potato cultivation in Bavaria as a staple).  Among his famous feats was the draining of the swampy lands in northeastern Munich to lay out a large public park, the ""Englischer garten"" (referring to him), one of the most splendid pleasure gardens in Europe.  Thompson-Rumford's more famous area were his social reforms, in particular handling pauperism, or as it is sometime put, ""clearing beggary"" from Bavaria.  Bavarian poor laws still operated on Medieval lines, reliant on the benevolence of the Catholic Church and the charity of alms-giving to the needy.  Thompson believed this had merely created a solid underclass of ""sturdy beggars"", particularly in Munich, who operated in a guild-like fashion, that seemed insurmountable and impervious to improvement.  Thompson-Rumford determined to overhaul the Bavarian poor system on a new rational basis and ""end"" intractable poverty.   On January 1, 1790, in his capacity as interior minister, Benjamin Thompson ordered the arrest of all the beggars of Munich. Within a week, some 2,600 beggars (or paupers suspected of begging) were rounded up (Munich then had a total population  of about 60,0000) .  The beggars were put to work in the ""House of Industry"", a new massive workhouse erected by Thompson-Rumford to manufacture military uniforms.  Jobs inside the House were arranged so that all types of people, including elderly and children, would have tasks suitable to their abilities. Work was paid (even if minimally), to restore an element of self-respect and pride in labor. This, Rumford believed, would break the cycle of poverty, institute new habits, and transition dependent paupers into self-sufficient wage laborers.  In this sense, Rumford was perhaps the first of a generation of Enlightenment thinkers who saw the existence of the poor not as an inevitability, a constant of the human history, part of the Divine order of society, but rather as a consequence of individual choices and habits.  Poverty was not ""with us always"", but a social problem that could be rationally solved. Thompson-Rumford, a micro-manager bent on rational efficiency, worked out the operation of the entire Bavarian poor system down to the last pfenning.  The provision of food to the inmates of his workhouses was a challenge of particular significance, and his solution - the soup kitchen - was perhaps his most famous contribution.  Since his youth,  Thompson had a deep interest in science, particularly the physics of heat.  From his early days in London, where he examined and experimented with the effects of heat of cannons, Thompson developed new theories about heat conductivity which would anticipate future thermodynamics.  While a military officer and civil servant in Bavaria, Thompson-Rumford was a member of various academies of sciences and found time to experiment and publish many scientific papers on the physics of heat.  But he also applied his knowledge practically to invent and develop new and more efficient ovens and ranges for warming and cooking.  He would later introduce improvements chimneys and furnaces.  The coffee percolator was another invention attributed to him. In social and economic history, Benjamin Thompson (Count of Rumofrd) is normally credited as the inventor of of the ""soup kitchen"".  Via his calculations, he had worked out that soup was the more efficient than bread to feed the inmates of his workhouses, and instituted industrial-scale soup kitchens using his new boilers.  Thompson-Rumford returned to Britain in 1795, and would thereafter divide his time between Munich and London.  Britain was then in the throes of the famous ""famine year"" of 1795, which led to a lot of renewed concern and rethinking about the English poor (Eden and Malthus would publish their studies shortly after).  Rumford leapt immediately into the fray of the British debate, and published his Essays, outlining his reforms of poor institutions in Bavaria, and promoting their application to Britain and other countries.  Rumford implemented the first soup kitchen in England at the Foundling Hospital in London on March 1796, using new ranges and boilers of his design.  However, Rumford still thought of soup kitchens in terms of feeding the inmates of a large institution.  But one of his more enthusiastic acolytes, the London police inspector Patrick Colquhoun, realized soup kitchens could also be used extra-murally, to feed the poor of entire neighborhoods (and indirectly control their behavior). Colquhoun spread Rumford's ""soup kitchen"" gospel to private charities which were raising money during the hunger years.  Colquhoun posited soup kitchens, rather than bread distribution, was the most efficient solution to feed the urban poor during the famine years, when wheat prices were high.  Soup kitchens for the urban poor, charging a penny a quart, were first set up in Spitalfields in 1797, and then subsequently spread to other towns in the kingdom. By the mechanism of selling tickets, the soup charities could personally screen those who applied, deny the ""undeserving"" and monitor the personal behavior of the remainder.  This, it was believed, would break the poor habits of the poor and eventually end poverty.    Thompson-Rumford's other great institutional invention was the establishment of the Royal Institution in London, arguably the first ""mechanics institute"" in Britain, in 1799 (it was preceded only by the Andersonian Institute in Glasgow).  Rumford designed it as a charity institution to deliver educational lecture series to the general public, particularly about new scientific principles in mechanics (physics) and chemistry.  Rumford's idea was to educate the more ambitious and clever members of the working class, giving them the scientific knowledge to make their own inventions and improve the machines they worked on.  The Royal Institution continues to this day. Having abandoned his first wife in America (who subsequently died), Benjamin Thompson re-married the widow of the chemist Antoine Lavoisier in 1802;   During his life, Thompson-Rumford gave bequests to the Royal Institution and Royal Society in London (establishing the Rumford medal there), as well as to institutions in his former homeland, such as the American Academy of Sciences in Boston.  At his death, his will endowed the Rumford chair in physics at Harvard, which was inaugurated in 1816.

Ibn Rushd (Averroes), 1126-1198,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/schools/islamic.htm#rushd," In the centuries between the fall of Rome to the European renaissance, one of the leading political, cultural and economic powers in the region was arguably the Islamic Caliphate and its successor states.  As such, the scholars of the Islamic world had much to say about economics -- primarily from a juristic standpoint, but also from an analytical one. What is commonly termed ""Islamic economics"" today refers effectively to this.   The Birth of the Islamic Caliphate (632-661) The calendar of the Islamic world marks the foundation of Islam in 622 CE, the year of the migration (hijrah) from Mecca to Medina of the fledgling community of Muslims led by the Prophet Muhammad.  But for historians, a more significant date is probably 632, the year of Muhammad's death and the election of Abu Bakr as his successor (Caliph), formally ""Commander of the Faithful"" (amir al-mu'minin).  As Abu Bakr was not directly appointed by the Prophet, and possessed no religious authority of his own,  many Arab tribal leaders felt little reason to transfer their political loyalties to him.  As such, the disparate coalition of Arabs which had formed the early community of Muslims (the ummah, in Arab parlance) began fragmenting.  Tribe and after tribe seceded and went on their own way, many of them resuming to their pre-Islamic beliefs and traditions.  There was a great likelihood that Islam would not survive the death of its charismatic Prophet.  It is to the political and organizational genius of the early Caliphs, then, that Islam owes its preservation.   One of the first tasks was to organize the compilation of the Holy Qur'an, hitherto held orally, believed to be the word of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by the archangel Gabriel. This became the central document of the new religion.  The Caliph also deployed the remnant of the Muslim army and whatever political authority he had left to bring the Arab coalition back together ('wars of the ridda').  In the course of this, the recovering Muslims came up against the Arab tribes of the northern frontier, clients of the Byzantine and Persian empires.  The enthusiastic energy of the Muslim commanders quickly turned what should have been routine border incursions into an out-and-out invasion of the ageing empires.  By 641, in the space of a less than ten years,  the bulk of the Persian empire and the Byzantine provinces of Syria, Palestine and Egypt were in Muslim hands.   Abu Bakr had died before the end of the first campaigns, and it fell to his successor, the Caliph Omar, to begin integrating these massive territories into a single political unit -- often called the Islamic empire or Caliphate.  The first problem of any empire is to restore law and order, and Omar had to improvise quickly. As it happened, the ethics of Islam (e.g. protection of the weak, the prohibition of fraud, etc.) were compatible with the underlying principles of the various legal traditions found within their empire (Roman, Arab, Jewish, etc.)  This made the job of the early Islamic judges (qadi) easier: if a local law did not contradict the Qur'an, it could stand.  On the economic front, the Islamic empire was inaugurated with a massive (if somewhat inadvertent) land reform program.  The Bedouin Arabs who did the bulk of the early conquering were nomads.  They were not interested in land and so did not ""replace"" the local pre-Islamic lords that they had deposed or killed in battle, but went off in search of more tangible booty.  As such, local peasants were often left to their own devices, and had to organize production, harvesting and storage by themselves.  Town and village councils sprouted up spontaneously for the purpose. So, in many areas of the Caliphate,  the new subject populations were instantaneously liberated from age-old serfdom and acquired an unheard of degree of political autonomy and economic empowerment.  For their part, the Caliphs were happy to see this happen, as it not only secured the loyalty of the conquered peoples, but it also gave them a ready-made system of local administration.  The new ownership tenures were ratified by appealing to the Muslim principle that anybody who works on abandoned land, after a certain period of time, automatically takes private possession of it.  ""He who revives dead land, owns it"", the Caliph Omar declared, quoting the Prophet himself.  But this was by no means uniform.  Sedentary Muslims in the armies, were quite keen to appropriate and settle down on conquered land.  However, their material aspirations were put to an end early on by the remarkable decision by Caliph Omar prohibiting any further redistribution and/or purchase of conquered lands by the Muslim conquerors.  This decision to protect local peasant-proprietorship in conquered lands was partly guided by fiscal concerns.  By Islamic law, Muslims are tax-exempt.  More precisely, zakat, the only tax Muslims paid, was already earmarked for the care of the poor.  As a result, the revenues necessary for the running of the empire itself had to be drawn from the payment of jizyah (poll-taxes) and kharaj (land-taxes) by non-Muslims (Dhimmis).  It is for this reason that the Caliphs were keenly interested in protecting the property and maintaining the economic well-being of non-Muslims within the empire. But Omar's decision of outright prohibition was too controversial. After some conflict, a compromise was reached.  Outright seizures of conquered land were prohibited, but purchases were allowed.  The ushr, a tithe on Muslim ""seizures and acquisitions"" (i.e. all Muslim-owned property outside the Arabian peninsula), was introduced to partly replace the lost revenues.  But this fiscal regime had several unanticipated side-effects.  In the first place, it prompted a massive wave of conversions to Islam.  Every conversion meant lost tax revenue -- and so we find, time and again, the paradoxical scene of Caliphal authorities discouraging further conversions to Islam.  It is indicative of the significance of non-Muslim taxes that Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians -- admittedly second-class citizens within the empire -- were nonetheless treated better and given more protections than tax-exempt Muslims of heterodox sects (Kharijites, Shi'ites, etc.)  The Umayyad Caliphate (661-750) In 656, the fourth caliph, Othman, was assassinated.  A period of civil war followed as various parties vied for succession, ending in 661 with the deposition of the fifth Caliph Ali and the ascension of Caliph Mu'awiya, leader of the Umayyad clan.  Ali's partisans, the Shi'ites, staged a rebellion in 680 in an effort to restore Ali's line, but were defeated once again.  This was followed up in 683 by a second civil war that nearly broke the empire in pieces.. The Umayyad Caliphs -- particularly Caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685-705) -- reunited and centralized the Caliphate in the aftermath.  To prevent the empire unraveling again, they overhauled its central institutional features.  They transformed it from a quasi-democratic ""community of Muslims"", into an autocratic state, ruled from its new capital in Damascus (Syria) via a set of interlocking aristocratic assemblies, or Shura (council of tribal leaders and provincial governors).  The caliph's seat itself was declared hereditary in the Umayyad family -- thereby introducing the dynastic principle for the Islamic empire.   The Umayyads restarted the process of expansion in 670, quickly capturing Byzantine North Africa (Ifriqiya) and, with more difficulty, the Berber kingdoms of the western Maghreb.  The conquest and absorption of the Berbers was completed only in 710.  In 712, an Arab-Berber army invaded Spain, conquering the peninsula from the Christian Visigoths in a short seven years.  That same year, an Arab-Persian army went east, conquering western India.  But Muslim expansion petered out shortly after that. A renewed Muslim assault on Byzantium ended at the walls of Constantinople in 719. The Muslim thrust into western Europe was halted by the Franks at Tours in 733 and into Asia at Samarkand in 751.  The frontiers of the Islamic Empire were subsequently stabilized at the Pyrenees in the west and the Punjab in the east, with pockets elsewhere. In the subsequent century, itinerant traders and missionaries would spread the faith further into Central Asia, East Africa and Southeast Asia while sea-borne Muslim adventurers from Spain and Africa seized control of the western Mediterranean islands and established enclaves in France and Italy. If the first Muslim conquests had been more-or-less ""accidental"", driven by the almost-independent initiative of individual Arab generals, the later conquests had been a bit more deliberate.   The Islamic empire was a cash state, dependent on tax revenues rather than demesne lands to function. Its armies also operated on a cash basis, depending on private markets for their supplies, paid out of regimental treasuries.  As such, many military campaigns had little more than fiscal goals in mind - an opportunity to plunder, collect tribute and replenish the treasuries.   From around 696, under Caliph Abd al-Malik, the Umayyads began minting their own gold coins (dinars), silver coins (dirhams) and copper tokens (flus). But the second wave of campaigns had not paid for itself.  The string of Muslim reverses, particularly at  Constantinople, had been expensive.  And as the frontiers stabilized, revenues from captured loot evaporated.  As the treasuries thinned, the Umayyad lords of Damascus instructed their provincial governors to dynamize local fiscal revenues.  This meant sending out tax-collectors to lean on local populations, whether Muslim or non-Muslim, and exacting new taxes and dues, even if they contradicted Islamic strictures.  As early as 685, the Umayyads declared that non-Arab Muslims (Mawalis) would pay the same taxes (kharaj and jizyah) as non-Muslims. In some areas, forced labor was introduced (the Qur'an explicitly forbids the enslaving of Muslims).  As a result, Berber and Persian converts to Islam, who had fought in the campaigns, felt particularly aggrieved. Contravening Islamic practice, the division of booty, the assignment of duties, pay and benefits, were very different for Arab and non-Arab soldiers.  Predictably, the Mawalis resented their relegation to second-class citizenship. Tax revolts and mutinies broke out in various locations, stretching Umayyad finances further and prompting the introduction of even more oppressive measures.  These exactions had become particularly routine in the caliphates of al-Walid (705-715) and Sulayman (715-17), and had driven the Mawalis to exasperation.  But in 718, the Umayyad caliph Umar II finally forbade the levying of extraordinary taxation and dues from non-Arab Muslims, thereby defusing much of the tension. But the expensive military reverses in the 720s and 730s had forced caliphal authorities to look for innovative ways to replenish their treasuries. During the caliphate of Hisham from 724, the prohibitions were sidestepped with re-interpretations, e.g. tying the hkaraj  to the land itself, rather than to religion of their owners, so that lands that were at any point subject to the kharaj remained under kharaj even if currently owned by a Muslim.  . In practice, all they really intended to do was to raise the ushr tax to the higher kharaj level.  But the legal device they used to accomplish this was very controversial. What they did was prohibit any further transfers of land ownership from non-Muslims to Muslims; Muslims could only lease these lands in long or perpetual leases, and so, because their owners were nominally non-Muslim, the lands were still subject to the high kharaj tax (whose burden would fall on the tillers).  This was certainly the wrong way to go about it. The legal device explicitly interfered in religiously-sanctioned freedoms of private property ownership and transfer. As resentments mounted, non-Arab Muslims (Mawalis) grew receptive to heterodox religious activists.  Many flocked to the Shi'ites, hoping to replace the Umayyyad caliphs with a ""better"" bloodline. But the Shi'ites were under microscopic surveillance by the Umayyad authorities. Others rallied behind those numerous messianic figures (Mahdis), self-proclaimed divine justicers, that kept popping up everywhere -- but they were ineffectual and disappeared just as quickly.  But there was another group that seemed to offer a a more permanent solution: the Kharijites.  The Kharijites preached a puritan form of Islam, promising a new political order, where all Muslims would be equal, irrespective of ethnicity or tribal status, and Islamic law would be strictly adhered to. Unlike the Shi'ites or the Mahdis, who promised only to replace one ruler with another, the Kharijites promised a new constitution.  The preaching of Kharijite activists fell on the receptive ears of non-Arab Muslims. The original Kharijites had been a radical group of Ali's followers  who had emerged in the 650s and proclaimed that laws are to be decided by God, not man.  Initially, they simply meant that they wanted ""trial by ordeal"" instituted -- so the Caliph should be decided upon in battle  (""God gives victory to the chosen""), not by the political agreement of tribal chieftains.  When no ""battle test"" was available, the Kharijites insisted that, at the very least, the Caliph must be a pious and upright Muslim, strictly observing all Islamic commandments.  They used this argument to legitimize assassinations of rival claimants to the Caliphate (including the ill-fated Ali) during the early civil wars. Those pretenders,  the Kharijites claimed, were impious and motivated by human ambition and thus unfit to rule.  They got even more radical in the early Umayyad reign.  The true test of an upright Caliph, the Kharijites now claimed, was not merely his personal conduct but also the extent to which the laws he institutes are strictly according to Qur'anic recommendations.  ""Enjoining the Good, Forbidding the Bad"" became the Kharijites rallying cry. :The Kharijites introduced the novel political notion that the Islamic empire should be a nomocracy (rule of law) and not an autocracy (rule of a man) or even a democracy (rule of men). Ranged against them were the Murj'ites, the ""liberals"" of the era.  Why translate all Islamic ethics and commandments into the law of the land, they asked?  If religious principles are a matter of personal conscience and divine justice, than what business is it of  human legislators and judges?  Not that that gives them the right to ride roughshod over basic human sensibilities (which may be informed by Islamic ethics), but, at their root, laws are a secular human affair, the prerogative of Caliph.  If you want to ensure accountability and curb abuses of power, then fiddle with the composition and powers of the assemblies (Shura). This debate over the nature of law -- secular or religious -- was the central battle in the more urgent struggle over the political future of the Caliphate.   The Kharijites echoed the feelings of many in the Muslim community who feared that the Umayyad dynasty, with the connivance of the Shura, was preparing to transform the Islamic Caliphate into a secular autocracy under themselves. Certainly, that is what many of the mistreated Mawalis came to perceive.  The choice  seemed to be self-evident.  If law was secular, as the Murj'ites advocated, then the source of law would be the Caliphs themselves.  If law was sacred, as the Kharijites insisted, then by the Islamic legal principle of ijma (""consensus""), the source of law would be in the hands the entire Muslim community.  Thus, the Kharijites -- those wild-eyed, violent, intolerant radicals of yore -- can be regarded as the spearhead of a democratic impulse against incipient tyranny, while the liberal Murj'ites were the apologists of authoritarianism.. The original Kharijites had been destroyed and dispersed by Umayyad military campaigns in the 690s, but their message continued to resonate and new Kharijite-type sects, like the Sufrites and the Ibadites, emerged here and there.  It helped that the new Kharijites had largely abandoned the murderous tactics of their predecessors and that respectable scholar-jurists had taken up the nomocratic doctrines and made them more sophisticated.  Kharijite preachers penetrated population centers and garrisons in the various corners of the caliphate. For non-Arab Muslims in particular, the new Kharijite doctrines were especially appealing , promising to establish the rule of law, a law which granted all Muslims full and equal rights.   The Revolt of Islam (750) All this came to a head in 740s.  In the west, fired up Kharijite preachers, the Berbers revolted against the Arab aristocracy.  In the east, around 747, the Persian general, Abu Muslim, forged a disparate coalition of frustrated Muslim zealots (Kharijites, Shi'ites) and disaffected mawalis of various ethnicities (Persians, etc.) against the ruling Umayyads.  After a brief civil war, the coalition was victorious and the Umayyad clan massacred.  The rebels installed Abu al-Abbas (""as-Saffah"") as caliph, thereby inaugurating the Abbasid dynasty of the Caliphate.  The capital was immediately transferred to Kufa (Iraq), the old center of Muslim scholars and Kharijite activists. The Abbasid revolution was momentous.  The Caliphate was redesigned as a nomocracy, governed by Islamic law (Shari'a).  Theoretically, legislation was God-ordained.  But by the ""consensus"" principle (ijma) of exegesis, laws were now in the hands of the entire Muslim community (the ummah).  In practice, this was narrowed down to the community of scholar-jurists (the ulama).  They were to be the effective ""legislators"" of the Islamic Empire and, like any normal legislature, they were fragmented into ""parties"" or ""schools of thought"" (fiqh).   The formal head of the empire, the Caliph, was ""elected"" by the ulama and was regarded merely as the upholder of Shari'a.  He was the executor and ultimate judge, but never the source of law.  The Caliph may make one school of law ""official"", but that did not make adherents of other schools any less legitimate.   Through all sorts of ups and downs, this arrangement was to last well into the 19th Century.  The ulama never ""delivered"" the law back up to the Caliph.   Practically every ruler over the Muslims rested their power on their promise to uphold the sacred law.  Where the ruler did not comply, the ulama felt entitled to declare him ""illegitimate"" and lead the revolt against him (formally, a Caliph was ""deposed"" by having his name dropped from the Friday prayers).    The first task of statecraft in a new nomocracy is, obviously enough, the establishment of the legal code. The old practice of simply letting old laws stand except where they contradicted the Qur'an could no longer do. That expedient allowed immense differences in law and custom to persist across the Caliphate. A secular empire may be able to tolerate these differences; but a nomocracy cannot.   If the Caliphate is to rest entirely on the rule of law then, at the very least, that law has to be clear.      So the scholar-jurists set themselves to work constructing Shari'a.  Islamic judges (qadi) needed direction, but they had little to go upon.  Only a very small fraction of the recommendations in the Holy Qur'an gives anything amounting to specific legal guidance, the remainder being mostly general ethical principles.  So the initial phase of just reviewing current practices and checking them against the Qur'an only went so far.  The next step was to reconcile the differences between practices. The first attempts at reconciliation were more-or-less arbitrary and unsystematic -- drawing on his personal intuition (raya), the judge would just declare that this version was ""more correct"" than that one. But that was easy for other jurists to challenge, leading to endless quibbles.  So several prominent legal scholars attempted to lay down more systematic guidelines for legal construction where Qur'anic exegesis was not clear.  Two schools of thought on this had clearly emerged by the late 700s.  The Maliki (or Medina) School, founded by Malik ibn-Anas, emphasized recourse to ijmi or ""consensus"" of opinion among the Muslim community.  The Hanafi (or Kufa) School, founded by Abu-Hanifa, emphasized recourse to ijtihad or independent ""reasoning"".  Various forms of reasoning were recognized by the Hanafi school: qiyas (reasoning by analogy), istiham (juristic preference, i.e. accounting for specific circumstances, etc.), istislah (benefit to the community) and urf (custom).   To justify their decisions and methods of legal construction, the Hanafi and Maliki jurists often invoked the opinions and practices of early Caliphs, the close companions of the Prophet (the ashrab) and even the Prophet himself, to reinforce their own interpretations.  The opinions of the second caliph, Omar, were particularly useful for the Maliki school, while the Hanafi school found much inspiration in Ibn Masud (one of the Prophet's most respected companions).  But how reliable were these old opinions?  Nearly a century had intervened since the death of the last companion of the Prophet. A vast number of stories and anecdotes about the lives and opinions of the early Muslims had circulated orally since. Like a game of Chinese whispers, lots of inaccuracies were conveyed as well..   These stories often contradicted each other in different renderings.  Many were likely to be wholly false -- because the person who recorded them had a bad memory, or misheard them, or simply fabricated them outright.    As they searched for these early opinions, the scholar-jurists began writing them down, carefully recording the chain of oral transmission -- ""I heard x say that y said that z said ... "", always ending in a witness who was actually there physically.  The compiled records of the stated opinions and observed practices of the Prophet and his close companions became known as the ""Traditions"" (Sunna).  Strictly speaking, a hadith is merely an extract from the Sunna.  However, perhaps confusingly, these terms are also commonly used to distinguish words and actions, i.e. hadith are the stated opinions of the Prophet, sunna are the observed practices of the Prophet and his companions. .The Golden Age (750-850) Unlike the Arab-supremacist Umayyads before them, the Abbasid Caliphs were deliberately cosmopolitan -- indeed, perhaps too cosmopolitan.  Although they remained committed to the Shari'a project, they were quick to rid themselves of their old puritanical allies. Astonishingly, leaders of the radical sects which had brought them to power were shown the door and some (including the old champion, Abu Muslim) were executed. Seeking to get away from the eagle-eyed jurists of Kufa, the Caliph Abdullah (""al-Mansur"") erected a new capital in Baghdad and surrounded himself with ministers in a court which recalled more the splendor of the Sassanid kings of Persia than the puritan simplicity of Medina.  Baghdad quickly rose to become one of the largest and most splendorous cities in the world.  Al-Mansur's successors, particularly Caliph Haroun (""al-Rashid"") (r.786-809), Caliph Abdullah (""al-Ma'mun"") (r.819-33) and Caliph al-Mu'tasim (833-44), presided over what is widely-regarded as Islam's ""Golden Age"".  Keeping in mind the maxim attributed to the Prophet, ""Seek knowledge, even unto China"", the empire was scoured for every fragment of knowledge, useful or not, Muslim or heathen, that could be found.  Legions of scholars -- Muslim, Christian and Jewish -- were brought to Baghdad's ""House of Wisdom"" to sift through them.  Among many other things, the philosophical and scientific works of the Classical Greeks were dug out from obscurity and translated into Arabic.  It is needless to repeat here how medicine, astronomy, science, philosophy, mathematics, agriculture, crafts, engineering, etc. were revolutionized in the process and then re-transmitted to Europe.   But Islam itself was also revolutionized.  The most famous philosophers during the Golden Age were the Mu'tazilites, a school of theology founded by Wasil bin-Ata in Basra, which had drank deeply from the recently-translated classics.  The express purpose of the Mu'tazilite enterprise was to reinforce the pillars of the Muslim faith and Islamic Law with rationalist Greek logos.  This would not only ""strengthen"" faith itself, but it would also endow Islam with a respectable theology that would enable it to respond to Zoroastrian, Jewish and Christian critics who continued to doubt the solidity of the fledgling religion.  The Mu'tazilites stressed the primacy of reason over revelation.  God would not command of man that which would be absurd or unreasonable.  Consequently, good and evil could be known by all men through reason alone. However, because of human weakness, revelation was necessary to confirm to man what was truly good and to provide men with rules of behavior which unaided reason could not comprehend.   Nonetheless, the Mu'tazilites insisted, reason directs the understanding of revelation.  To reinforce their rationalist theology, the Mu'tazilites denounced the literal interpretations of the Qur'an.  They insisted that the Qur'an was a creation of God, and not the Word of God -- and like all of His creations, temporal and imperfect. As evidence, they pointed to the multiple attributes and anthropomorphic descriptions of God in the Qur'an -- which, interpreted literally, can lead down the slippery slope to polytheism.  The Mu'tazilites also stressed the the freedom of the human will, arguing that predestination was incompatible with Divine justice.  They made clever use of Aristotle's ""infinite regression"" paradox, developing a distinctly Platonic cosmology that argued that God ""created"" the world from an ""eternal matter"" with its own ""natural laws"".   The Mu'tazilites were celebrated during the Golden Age and showered with honors by the Abbasid Caliphs. The success of Mu'tazilites also helped the Hanafi legal school, which was perhaps closest to them in spirit.  The Mu'tazilites reached the apex of their influence with the ""inquisition"" (mihna) imposed by Caliph al-Ma'mun in 833, whereby all persons of rank -- including jurists -- were forced to make a public profession confirming the ""createdness"" of the Qur'an.  While often compared to the great Enlightenment figures of 18th C. Europe, the Mu'tazilites were seen in a much different light by their contemporaries.  The scholar-jurists, in particular, found their theories -- particularly the ""createdness"" of the Qur'an doctrine -- profoundly disturbing.  For if the Qur'an is ""imperfect"" and faith only understandable by ""reason"", then the implication is that the some men are better interpreters of the revelations than others.  Many immediately suspected the Mu'tazilites of attempting to establish an Islamic priesthood.  Was that their intention?  It is not unlikely..  Until the advent of Islam, a powerful priesthood had been central part of Persian society.  For the openly and unabashedly Persophile Abbasid court of Baghdad, the restoration of this privileged caste in some form or other would have been the ultimate act of nostalgia.   The Mu'tazilites, many of whom were of Persian origin themselves, rather enjoyed being fawned over by the Abbasid Caliphs and likely wouldn't have minded it.  But for the scholar-jurists of Kufa and elsewhere, the notion of an Islamic priesthood was anathema.  In 750, they had risked life and limb to overthrow the Umayyads and restore the law to the Muslim community.  Now the Mu'tazilites were trying to ""steal it back"" by denying the capacity -- and thus, implicitly, the right -- of the average man to interpret the Qur'an himself.  This could not be.  They did not throw out an autocracy merely to see it replaced by a theocracy (and not merely so, for a priesthood under the Caliph's thumb would indirectly deliver control of the law to him as well -- autocracy revisited).   The 833 mihna -- the Mu'tazilite inquisition about the ""createdness"" of the Qur'an -- was the last straw.  It is one thing to profess a philosophical doctrine, it is quite another to impose it, for then you are indeed acting in the capacity of a priest.  Legions of scholar-jurists, particularly of the Maliki school, refused to swear to it.  So did many government officials, particularly those of Arab extraction who resented the new Persian dominance.  Non-compliant jurists and officials were dismissed from their posts, barred from mosques, imprisoned and some even tortured and executed, by the Abbasid authorities.  The martyrdom of the few encouraged the opposition of the many.  As the tidal wave began to form, the Abbasids realized they had overstepped. The Sunni Revolution (850-900) The mihna was repealed soon after the ascension of the new Abbasid Caliph Mu'tawakkil in 847. The Mu'tazilites were scuttled out of court and a reaction against the excessive rationalism and Persophilia of the ""Golden Age"" was set in motion. It did not occur all of a sudden, but proceeded slowly over several decades.  What emerged from it is something known today as ""Sunni Islam"", the most widely practiced or orthodox version of Islam. The bards of the Sunni revolution was the Ash'arite school of theology, founded by the renegade philosopher, Ali al-Ash'ari, as a direct answer to the Mu'tazilities  Advocating the primacy of revelation over reason, the Ash'arites defended literal interpretation of the Qur'an.  They admitted that the Qur'an was material, given that it was revealed in a particular human language, at a particular time, in a particular location, etc.  However, they stopped short of admitting that it was a ""creation"" of God.  The Qur'an is still ""perfect"" and unequivocal, it is just the imperfection of human language that has caused the confusion and difficulties.  Reason can play a role in disentangling a truer understanding from the thickets of imperfect language, but literalness should never be abandoned, reason can never trump the Word.  The Ash'arites also reconciled predestination with Divine justice by distinguishing human will from human acts.  Invoking Neo-Platonist doctrines, they noted that the function of reason and language was to circumscribe and divide, thus God -- One and Absolute -- cannot be ""accessed"" by rational analysis and understanding, but rather only through extra-rational revelation and mystical experience - thus opening the way for Sufi practices.  But switching the Baghdad court's favorite philosophers does not a revolution make.  The main event occurred in the foundations of Islamic law.  This had nothing to do with the fancy logical acrobatics of theologians, but with a more gradual movement which was now gathering speed.  The movement stemmed from the groundbreaking 815 treatise of the jurist Muhammad al-Shafi'i, founder of the Shafi'ite School of legal thought.  Al-Shafi'i had grown increasingly uncomfortable with the great variations and inconsistencies in legal practice which the Malikite and Hanafite scholars had allowed to persist.  To fix this, al-Shafi'i insisted that there are only five sources of legal knowledge, and placed them in strict order of importance:    (1) the Holy Qur'an; 
(2) the Hadith (sayings attributed to the Prophet); 
(3) the Sunna (practices attributed to the Prophet and his close companions); 
(4) the ijma (consensus among religious authorities)
(5) qiyas (reasoning by analogy).   Notice that, contrary to the Hanafi, the Shafi'ites denied the legal validity of any form of reasoning other than reasoning by analogy.  And, against the Maliki, consensus is relegated to a lowly position on the list.  But that's not the important point.  The important point is that the Sunna are elevated to a position superior to either consensus or reasoning.   This would have tremendous consequences. At first glance, it may seem that all al-Shafi'i accomplished was the foundation of just another school of legal thought, barking in a cacophany of legal debate.  But in practice, Islamic law changed its nature completely.   Prior to al-Shafi'i, Islamic law had been a dynamic and progressive jurisprudence.  New decisions were made according to the most recent precedent and would, in turn, set the precedent for the next.  Al-Shafi'i's hierarchy of sources turned that around.  The most important precedent was not the latest, but the first, as found in the Sunna.  A single interpretation or decision by the Prophet himself or one of his companions automatically trumps all consensus and reasoning by the latest and brightest jurists.  This was core of the Sunni revolution.  Previously, Malikites and Hanafites might invoke the opinions of the Prophets and his companions to support their own opinion, but they were merely consulting them, not giving them authoritative primacy.  If the Prophet said one thing in the past, but consensus in the present says otherwise, than the latter is taken up.  The Prophet and his companions, however upright and wise, are just another group of men, after all, who lived in a different time and society anyway.  No longer. By al-Shafi'i's doctrine, the opinions of the Prophet and his companions, being closer to the divine origin, were consequently superior.  Their logic, their reasoning, their decisions and practices are more authoritative. Islamic law did not embrace the Shafi'ite school itself in any exclusive manner, but rather but rather al-Shafi'i's arguments about the primacy of the Sunna filtered to the other schools of jurisdprudence.  Their differences remained: the Maliki continued to emphasize consensus, the Hanafi the several types of reasoning.  But all schools, step-by-step, began to acknowledge the authoritative supremacy of the Sunna right after the Qur'an. This process was given a shot-in-the-arm by the labors of hadith scholars, such as al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud and others towards the late 800s.  They did not merely collect and record the hadith, but sifted through them, painstakingly reconciled and corrected the chains of transmission and evaluated and coded them by their degree of authenticity.  The Sunna, heretofore a disparate and incongruous collection, became systematic and readily-accessible to the jurists.  The availability of the Sunna, perhaps more than the arguments of al-Shafi'i, is what really persuaded the other schools to hop on board. Other schools of thought emerged during this time.   There were two further (and stricter) off-shoots of Shafi'itism: the Hanbali legal school (founded by Ahmad ibn-Hanbal) which further reduced the role of sources (4) and (5) and the Zahiri legal school (founded by Dawud ibn Khalaf) which insisted on strict literalism and eliminated (5) outright.   Another interesting outcome from the Shafi'ite revolution is that it gave the Shi'ites the impetus to embrace legalism.  The Shi'ites had been disappointed by the settlement of the 750 Abbasid revolution.  Their objective had been narrowly political: replacing the Umayyad caliph with the one from Ali's line. They were not particularly interested in Islamic law -- indeed, the Shari'a project seemed positively contrary to their cause: if legislation was God-ordained and in the hands of jurists, then it did not really matter who the Caliph was.  The Shafi'ite revolution changed all that, because it gave authoritative power to a few ""great men"" (i.e. the Prophet and his companions).  All the Shi'ites had to do was expand the list of great men to include their champions (they also struck out the first three Caliphs as usurpers).  So, the practices and opinions of the Shi'i Imams were compiled and a Shi'ite legal school was born.  The Shi'ites created a class of jurists of their own, talking in the same language and voicing similar principles as their Sunni counterparts, just drawing on a different set of traditions.  The fact that the Imam was still around, then there was a ""living"" source for the law, i.e. innovations could be introduced.  The ""occultation"" of the last Imam (which most Shi'ites believe happened in 872), didn't cramp their style.  The jurists just took on the oracular role of speaking on behalf of the ""hidden"" Imam.  The current legislative authority of Shi'ite jurists, an authority their Sunni counterparts never have had, was justified by the claim that they are still being inspired by the ""hidden"" Imam.  So, in a sense, the Shi'ite traditions are still a work-in-progress.    Philosophy vs. theology In the realm of theology, the scuttling of the Mu'tazalites in 849 did not put an end to rationalism or philosophy.  Hellenism was ingrained deep in the Islamic intellectual world, so there was a counter-reaction by several rationalist philosophers, like al-Kindi in the 9th Century, al-Farabi in the 10th, Ibn Sinna in the 11th and Ibn Rushd in the 12th.  Drawing upon Aristotle and with increasing sophistication, the rationalists sought to reconcile rationalist philosophy and revealed theology.  Their works were particularly influential on Scholastic Christian scholars like St. Thomas Aquinas, and Jewish theologians like Moses Maimonides. But the efforts of the Islamic rationalists were countered by Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali in the 11th Century.  Using Aristotelian arguments himself, al-Ghazali reiterated the Ash'arite position, stressing the primacy of revelation over reason, arguing that rationalist philosophy had nothing to say about matters of theology.   Al-Ghazali's sophisticated theology was embraced as the ""dogma"" of Sunni Islam.   The significance of al-Ghazali's doctrine on the intellectual development of the Muslim theology has been variously interpreted.  Some critics like to point out that by ""killing off"" the rationalists, al-Ghazali might have inadvertently stifled the continued development of science and philosophy in the Islamic academies.  But the actual effect of al-Ghazali's work was precisely the opposite, for by strictly separating science from religion, al-Ghazali liberated science from being a handmaiden to theology and allowed scientific inquiry to be pursued for its own sake.  Philosophical inquiry inside theology may have suffered, as the best minds in  Muslim theology no longer felt compelled to dig through classical philosophy or engage in rationalist calisthenics.  But scientific inquiry did not miss a beat - and the output of Muslim scientists continued unabated and even accelerated, their methods more comfortably rational and empirical than ever.  The scientific method could now take wing without worrying about stepping on theological toes. Much of the best scientific work of the Islamic world came after al-Ghazali, not before.  In that respect, to lament al-Ghazali's ""victory"" over theological rationalists like Ibn Rushd would be akin to regretting Sir Francis Bacon's ""victory"" over the equivalent Aristotlean Scholastics of his own time.       Fragmentation One of the vital legacies of the Sunni Revolution of the 850s was the dispensation of the caliph himself.  With the law now in the hands of the jurists, separated from temporal authorities, it did not matter much who the ruler was, or if Muslims were even under Muslim rulers at all.   From the 9th Century down to the modern era, Muslims have lived in a variety of states of all kinds of political stripes - many with rulers who reached the heights (or depths) of absolute despotism.  But the law was never delivered back into the hands of political rulers. There was nothing in Islamic philosophy that approached the idea of the ""divine right of kings"".  Jurists remained independent, and that independence was maintained even under the most ambitious of despots.  And it remained true in practice.  The outcome of legal cases involving private citizens versus government officials were not a foregone conclusion.  Nor cases involving men of different social rank, or even Muslims versus non-Muslims.  The rules of jurisprudence, the sources, were clearly set out and by and largely adhered to in the courts, regardless of political power or official favoritism. The irrelevance of rulers allowed for the fragmentation of the Islamic world into multiple political entities.  Already in the 750s, the Abbasids did not rule the entire Islamic world, but had to contend with break-away Muslim states on their peripheries - like the Umayyad emirate in Spain, Kharijite and Shi'ite states in the Maghreb, etc.  They were not only under independent rulers, many did not even acknowledge the Caliph in Baghdad as their notional caliph. The theory was tested perhaps most vigorously in the aftermath of the Mongol conquest of Baghdad in 1258.  This was not the first time Muslims had come under non-Muslim rule - it had happened before during the Spanish recoquista, the Crusader states of the Levant, etc. But the Mongols had put an end to the Abbasid caliphate.  The scholar-jurists of the Muslim world debated how to react.  Some, like Ibn Tamiya, preached the necessity of restoring the caliphate, and dusted off the doctrine of jihad or holy war, to expel the Mongol conquerors.  But the general consensus of the scholar-jurists was that the ruler was irrelevant, even non-Muslim ones, so long as they upheld or respected Islamic law in Muslim communities, it was the duty of Muslim subjects to remain loyal to the constituted political authorities, whatever their political, ethnic or religious characteristics may be. Islamic economics  The term ""Islamic economics"" has been given various meanings by different economists.  But by and large it refers to the legal aspects, specifically how Islamic law understands and implicates economic organization and practice. Commerce and Property In contrast to the Christian scholars, Islamic scholars were certainly less troubled by commerce and capitalism. The Prophet Mohammed, after all, had been a merchant and so were many of his early followers (Mecca was a major commercial center in the 7th Century). Thus, throughout the Sunna, we find continual references to private enterprise, profit and commerce.  The Holy Qur'an and the Hadith are peppered with statements in praise of merchants -- e.g. the Prophet is said to have said ""Merchants are the messengers of this world and God's faithful trustees on Earth"" and ""He who makes money pleases God"", etc.  Islam, unlike Christianity, did not have to grapple too much with the problems of church property, or square the contradictions between spiritual goals and material facts in religious institutions.   While some sects extolled the spiritual ideal of poverty, it never achieved the prominence that can be found in Christianity or Buddhism. Although poor preachers, holy men and Sufi ""saints"" were respected, and some even venerated, in local communities, Islam does not have a tradition of religious mendicants. Admittedly, there was a class of professional beggars, who justified themselves by scripture and were even incorporated into guilds in several Arab cities.  Although Islam stresses that God is the ultimate owner of all property (S. III.189), it recognizes the right of human ""trustees"" to dispose of it as if it were privately owned.  As detailed in the Sunna, private ownership was certainly the norm among the Prophet's followers.  The right to private ownership is not disputed among legal schools.  There were quibbles, however, about the details of transferring property (particularly inheritance).  Profit, too, was sanctioned.  Buying low and selling high was regarded as natural, not immoral.  Unlike their Christian counterparts, most Islamic scholars and jurists did not worry about ""just price"".  The ""just price"" is whatever price was deemed acceptable by traders.   There were restrictions, of course.  The merchant must conduct his trade honestly and he must not deal in impure goods (e.g. wine, pigs, etc.).  Common goods (e.g. water, grass) were given special protection.  Zakat, the duty of regular charity, was enforced and took a substantial bite out of profits.  Conspicuous consumption was discouraged (""Eat and drink: but waste not by excess for God loveth not the wasters"" (S.VII.31)) and periods of abstention (notably, the fasting month of Ramadan) were instituted as a reminder (""so that ye may learn self-restraint."" (S.II.183)).  The hoarding of wealth was deplored (""And there are those who bury gold and silver and spend it not in the way of God: announce unto them a most grievous penalty"" (S.IX.34)).  Speculation upon necessities, such as food, in times of great need, was frowned upon.  The prohibition of usury (riba) and dealing in uncertainty (gharar) -- which we shall return to momentarily -- naturally placed limits on the size and scope of commercial ventures.   Nonetheless, outside this relatively small set of reminders and restrictions, Islamic legal codes and authorities took a generally laissez-faire attitude on economic matters.   Crimes against property, such as theft, were subject to harrowing penalties.  Some scholars recognized the ""legitimacy"" of theft in cases of ""dire need"" (when, it must be assumed, zakat is not being properly collected and administered), but this was a minority opinion.   Theoretically, government appropriation was justified in the case of  ""misuse"" of private property (hijr).  An example of ""misuse"" is when property is hoarded or left unutilized.  The Prophet is said to have said that if land is left uncultivated or undeveloped for three years, the owner will cease to have any right to it, a principle enshrined by Caliph Omar's declaration (""he who revives dead land, owns it; but the demarcator has no right after three years"").  Also condemned are the use of property to harm others (e.g. building a dam on your land to deprive your neighbors of water) or to procure extra-economic benefits (e.g. political enfranchisement).  Profiteering is also considered ""misuse"".  The Prophet is said to have said: ""Whoever withholds cereals that they may become scarce and dear is a sinner.""   The ""misuse of property"" idea served as the basis of the Islamic condemnation of monopolistic practices.   This was particularly emphasized by the Hanbali jurists, Ibn Tamiya and Ibn al-Qayyim.  Although puritanical, they were also quite ""progressive"" in the sense of emphasizing that the State was responsible for social welfare.  They introduced the notion of the ""price of the equivalent"" -- which is the closest Islamic scholars dared come to the idea of ""just price"".   They discussed how how competition (and the lack of it) will draw actual market prices nearer to (or away) from it. Initially, the property of conquered peoples did not receive quite the same protection in the law, but once Omar, the second caliph, prohibited the distribution and purchase of conquered lands by Muslims, a new system was instituted whereby the property of non-Muslims were afforded full protection upon payment of jizyah and kharaj taxes.  The Prohibition of Usury The Islamic position on usury was no less complicated than the Christian one.  Scriptural exigency was clearer the Qur'an, e.g. ""Those who devour usury will not stand except as stands one whom the Evil One by his touch hath driven to madness.  That is because they say ""Trade is like usury,"" but God hath permitted trade and forbidden usury."" (S.II:275; see also S.II.278). So from the outset, it seems clear that Qur'an forbids usury.  But what is usury?  This is unclear and left unexplained.  The Arabic term, riba, means merely ""increase"" and early Islamic jurists had scant else to go on.  As a result, Islamic scholars have had to look to other legal sources for explanation, and an enormous body of scholarship has swirled around this.  Most of them focused on the following Hadith attributed to the Prophet: ""Exchange gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, similar to similar, hand to hand.  He who gives or takes more incurs riba, the giver and taker are equal (usurers)"".  In another narration, the following was added ""Should the kind of commodities differ, then exchange as you wish provided that the exchange is hand to hand.""   This Hadith has given the outline for the Islamic law on usury.  But the different schools of Islamic legal thought interpreted it differently. The Zahiri school, for instance, said that the ban on usury should only apply to the six commodities mentioned (the ribawi: gold, silver, wheat, barley, dates and salt); usury in all other commodities is permissible.  The Hanafi, Hanbali and Shi'a schools extended the ban on usury by analogy to all commodities which are measured by weight (like gold and silver) or volume (like wheat, salt, barley and dates).  So, items like beans and rice, measured by volume, would could under the usury ban, while cloth, measured by length, would be exempt.  The Shafi and Maliki schools extended the ban by analogy to all foodstuffs and excluded all non-foods (except the two mentioned metals) from the ban.  Curiously, all schools permitted usury in money that was made neither of gold nor silver (e.g. minor coins, like the copper flus, were exempt).   The ban on usury, may seem innocuous once we have limited the ban to a certain types of goods. But most financing occurred precisely in the form of these goods -- gold, silver, grain, etc. and so it put a large crimp on many things.   As long as the gold dinar and the silver dirham reigned over the Islamic world, this seemed a practicable resolution.  But when bills of exchange began circulating (as early as the 8th Century), the debate picked up once again.  Some said that dealing with bills was like dealing with interest-bearing debt and thus banned, while others insisted they dealt with the traded commodities, and thus whether interest was permissible was contingent on the commodity.  Some said that because they were ultimately backed by gold and silver, then the usury ban applied; others claimed that as they were made of paper, then they were like flus, a money of a different ""metal"", and thus exempt.   The issue of rent was a bit more complicated as it has features very similar to usury. In the strictest interpretation, a landlord cannot demand a ""fixed"" amount of crop or monetary payment as rent but only a share of the harvest or profits.  However, most jurists maintain that a fixed rent is acceptable if the landlord has contributed long-term improvements to the land, such as drainage, fencing, etc., in which case rent takes on the legal character of the landlord's ""wage"".  If a landlord makes no contributions to the land, however, scholars agree that he cannot demand a fixed rent. Of course, what is determined in theory has to be distinguished from what happens in practice.  Usury is prohibited in Shari'a outright, but, no matter how strict the school of thought, individual jurists are allowed to exercise discretion and thus, in practice, many exceptions slide by.  The penalties for riba (unlike other offenses, like drinking wine) are traditionally very light -- often a civil matter quickly and quietly resolved with a fine.  The disincentive was not very high.  Nonetheless, Muslim merchants and financiers developed a variety of financial arrangements to serve as an alternative to debt .  Acceptable forms of financing include the following: (1) musharaka (partnership): this is the simplest financing method.  Two (or more) people pool their resources in a joint venture, participate in its management and share the profits and losses on a pre-determined basis.  (2) mudarabah (silent partnership): also known as the Commenda in Europe, this form of financing operates as a kind of mutual fund.  One party puts up the capital, the other puts in the entrepreneurial skill.  The lender is entitled to a pre-determined share of the profits (and losses), but not a guaranteed return.  Some jurists argue for asymmetric distribution, i.e. the lender's share in case of profits is less than his share in case of losses.  The logic is that the entrepreneur's contribution of time and effort is already a sunk cost.  While musharka and mudarabah may be convenient financing methods for businesses, consumer loans cannot really be financed this way as there are no ""profits"" to be redistributed.  The following religiously-acceptable set of purchase/sale contracts are meant to replicate consumer loans: (3) murabaha (""cost-plus-profit"" financing): the financier acts as the purchasing agent for the borrower, and then sells the goods to the borrower with a fixed mark-up on the purchase price (e.g. a bank buys a house for ""itself"" and then sells it to the borrower with a 10% profit for its ""services"").  The borrower is allowed to defer payment.   (4) ijara wa iktina (hire-purchase, leasing) Instead of handing the home-buyer a mortgage, a bank ""enters"" into a partnership with a customer to jointly own a house.  For use of the portion of the house ""owned"" by the bank, the customer pays ""rent"" to the bank (i.e. pays interest) and, over time, ""buys out"" the bank's share (i.e. pays back principal).  Once again, this is virtually indistinguishable from an interest-bearing loan, except in the legal code. The banning of usury complicated, but did not end, debt finance.  There were always ways to ""create"" interest-bearing loan contracts.  The simplest is simply via ""delayment fees"".  For instance, in a murabaha contract, the financier could increase the mark-up the longer the deferment period (e.g. 1 month deferment means 11% mark-up, 2 months, 12% mark-up, etc.).  Alternatively, they could charge a high mark-up for a long period (e.g. 20% for one year) and then offer a discount for ""quick repayment"".   These delayment fees and speeding-up discounts effectively replicated interest, but their legal status is different.    The ""repurchase agreement"" (known both in the Christian and Muslim worlds as the mohatra contract) was the perhaps the most common dodge.  Agent A would sell agent B a worthless item (e.g. a candlestick) for 110 dinars payable in a year's time, and then immediately turn around and buy the candlestick back from agent B for 100 dinars in cash now.  In effect, agent A has just made a one-year loan to agent B at 10% interest -- but it looks like a pair of legitimate purchases and sales.  Of course, in the end, no good but gold exchanged hands and so a strict judge may be able to condemn it.  So a slight variation has agent A buy back something else (say, a matchbook) from agent B for 100 dinars and so there are two clearly separate transactions.  As the money has been exchanged for different goods, all we can detect is a price ratio between candlesticks a year hence and matchbooks now, no hint of usury is (legally) in sight.  The Hadith, recall, says that in trading one good for a different good, the price is whatever is decided upon by the traders.  No ""just price"" calculations come into play and if agent B wants to pay exorbitant amounts for candles and A overpay for matchbooks, so be it.    Another famous dodge is the contractum trinius, composed of three separate contracts: (1) agent A invests 100 dinars in agent B; (2) agent A sells agent B his right to any profit above, say 30 dinars, for a fee of 15 dinars; (3) For a fee of 5 dinars, B agrees to absorb all losses from the enterprise.  The net result is a 100 dinar loan from A to B with a fixed interest payment of 10 dinars.   Islamic jurists condemned these kinds of tricky practices and tried hard to provide workable definitions of usury to handle these dodges.  They carefully defined and condemned riba al-nasi'ah (interest on money lent), riba al-fadl (interest obtained via trading contracts) and riba al jahiliyyah (delayment fees).  However, not all schools or jurists agreed to their definitions.  Liberal judges, usually Hanafi, were often willing to let riba al-fadl to slip through. Some jurists went even further, arguing that the ban on interest should only apply to consumption loans, while productive loans were exempt.  The argument here was based on the historical ""fact"" that in the time of the Prophet, when usury was first banned, most loans were consumption loans.  Others argued that the prohibition only applies to excessive usury.   This argument is based on the Qur'anic verse  ""Oh ye who believe! Devour not usury, doubled and multiplied; But fear God; that ye may prosper."" (S.III.130).  However, the condemnation of usury is so vehement and unequivocal in the Hadith (the Prophet is said to have compared it to incest) that such a contention cannot stand. Gambling and Risk A few words must be given to the prohibition of gambling (gharar).  Medieval Islamic jurists expanded the definition of ""gambling"" beyond its scriptural confines to include trading wherever risk or uncertainty is involved.  This was done in response to Egyptian soldiers using their paychecks (drafts on local grain deposits) to speculate on the grain market at a time of great need.  Banning their speculative activity by calling it gharar, rather than on some other legal basis, was probably a mistake.  All things in life (especially commercial life) are uncertain. Nonetheless, the ban is technically in place, although many jurists (for good reason) have chosen to take its teeth out. The basis for the ban is the Prophet's disapproval, documented in the traditions, of certain types of transactions with uncertain outcomes.  These include the sale of unborn offspring of animals (existence is uncertain -- they may be stillborn), the advance sale of the fruit of a tree prior to ripening (the quantity of ripe fruit is uncertain), the sale where the outcome is based on the throw of a pebble (pure gambling) and the sale by a cloth vendor in which he does not give the buyer a proper opportunity to examine the cloth (trade is not transparent).   By analogy, waiters working for tips or salesmen working on commission are deemed to be engaged in gharar because one cannot predict  the volume of trade and thus the income that will be forthcoming.   The prohibition of gharar is more easily circumvented than that of usury since it only needs a more careful definition of the contract.  For instance, instead of hiring a hunter and pay him a fixed amount per rabbit caught (as yet unknown), hire him on the basis of the hours of labor he puts into catching rabbits (clear and well-defined).  Similarly, with waiters and salespeople who would otherwise rely on tips or commissions.  However, some jurists say that the ban only applies if the outcome of a particular enterprise is purely uncertain, in the sense that there is nothing systematic the entrepreneur can do to affect that outcome.  Because the number of rabbits caught, the satisfaction of customes or the number of sales is systematically dependent upon the efforts of the hunter, waiter and salesman respectively, then the outcome is not completely ""uncertain"" and thus not subject to the prohibition of gharar. Other jurists have stressed a stricter definition of gharar which is more in line with its ""gambling"" origins.  Ibn Taimiya for instance, noted that the main element of ""gambling"" is that who gains and who loses is purely dependent on chance.  When two people bet on a toss of a coin, one will win completely and the other lose completely.  If, however, the winner agrees to share his gains with the loser, then the bet is not, strictly speaking, gharar.   This stricter definition of gharar however still implicates many common activities, notably insurance.  Jurists claim that conventional insurance is gharar because when a claim is not made (as chance dictates), one party (the insurance company) acquires all the gains (the premium), while the other party (the insured) gets nothing.  In their view, conventional insurance contracts are pure gambles: the insurance company ""bets"" that I do not get sick while I bet that I get sick.  As an alternative vehicle, Islamic jurists recommend ""cooperative insurance"" (takaful), where the insurance company is, in effect, a ""community fund"".  Members of this ""community"" contribute premiums to indemnify any member of the community who experiences a specific loss.  The issue of forward contracts are trickier, since they inevitably involve uncertainty.  In the Hadith, the Prophet is said to have said ""Whoever buys cereals he shall not sell them until he obtains their possession"" and ""Bargain not about that which is not with you.""  This is obviously impracticable and the Sunna has numerous instances of forward contracts being undertaken by both merchants and farmers.  So, the prohibition has been given a narrower meaning.  Specifically, Islamic law allows salam contracts on commodities, where goods are paid for in advance, only their delivery is deferred.  The Hanafi school stresses that even though delivery is deferred in a salam contract, the goods must already be in existence somewhere; the other schools allow them to ""come into being"" in the interim period.  Commodity futures contracts where both payment and delivery of commodities are deferred to the future are expressly forbidden by all schools.  The exception to this is istisna, or a futures contract on manufactured goods.  Goods that need to be manufactured do not need to be paid in advance, nor is it necessary to determine a date of delivery. Public Finance Islamic law has imposed several constraints on the financing of government activity.  There are four sources of religiously-ordained revenues:  (1) Zakat, the duty of regular charity is one of the ""five pillars"" of Islam, as inseparable to the identity of a Muslim as regular prayer. In practice, it is a redistributive property tax.  Zakat is not optional.  Voluntary charity (sadaqah) is encouraged, but zakat is obligatory for all Muslims and backed, if need be, by the full force of the civil authorities.   Almost from its inception, zakat has been collected by the State on behalf of the poor.  It is a tax on property held for more than a year, assessed after deductions for living expenses.  The theological reasoning for zakat is not only to provide for the poor, but also to ""punish"" idle property and encourage it to be put into circulation. As with all such things, the legal schools were divided on what exactly is subject to zakat.  From the original sources, the consensus was that gold, silver and the profits of trade are taxed at 2.5% per annum.  Livestock is taxed at the same rate.  Agricultural and farming produce is taxed at 10%  p.a. if irrigated naturally by rain and by 20% p.a. if irrigated artificially.   The reasoning for this differential, based on a Hadith, is that artificial irrigation deprives others of a scarce resource (water in this case) and thus it is the responsibility of the depriver to compensate the community for it.  Mines and extracted natural resources are taxed at 20% for the same reason.  Zakat on modern property -- such as industrial machinery, dividends on stock, etc. -- is assessed by analogy. (2)  Jizyah is the poll tax paid by non-Muslim dhimmis (Jews and Christians) and commanded in the Qur'an (S.IX.29),.  Some have considered this a tax in order to ""punish"" dhimmis for failing to be steadfast in the true religion.  Others have taken it simply as the purchase of a ""right"" to live in a community of Muslims and have their persons, property and religious rituals protected by law, as well as to be exempt from military service.  In practice, the payment of jizyah, while higher than zakat, was not crushing.  Jizyah has the characteristics of a poll tax, in that the amount is owed is assessed per head, rather than per dinar of income. But it is not a uniform tax across all people.  For starters, there are classes of people - the very poor, women, the elderly, disabled, monks, etc. - that are entirely exempt from jizyah.  Moreover, even its assessment on free, able-bodied men was often qualified by income.   For instance, Amr ibn al-As, after conquering Egypt, set up a census to measure the population for the jizya, and thus the total expected jizya revenue for the whole province, but organized the actual collection by partitioning the population into wealth classes, so that the rich paid more and the poor less jizya of that total sum.   Elsewhere, it is reported customary to partition the population into three classes for jizyah collection, e.g. 48 dirhams for the rich, 24 for middle class and 12 for the poor. In many communities, the burden of jizyah often fell in practice on the wealthy alone, whom by solidarity or custom, assumed the payment of the jizyah for the poorer members of the community. Landlords paying the jizyah of his tenants was routine (often more expedient, and taken out of rents anyway). (3) Kharaj is the tax on the produce of lands conquered in the course of the expansion of Islam, but kept in the hands of non-Muslim tillers.  This was perhaps the major source of government revenue during the early Islamic Empire. (4) Ushr is a tithe on conquered lands held or bought by Muslims or previously uncultivated lands brought into cultivation by Muslims.  Today, ushr is charged for the use of State-owned lands.  (5) The Caliphal fifth. is a 20% tax on war spoils, that was instituted in the early days of the Islamic conquest, the rate mandated in the Qur'an  (S.8:41).  Initially earmarked for the maintenance of the Prophet's family, after the Prophet's death, it was re-directed by the early Caliphs for the central administration and armies of the Caliphate.  The Hanafi school argued the caliphal fifth extends to spoils discovered after the war is over, such as hidden treasure troves and (more significantly), it was extended by analogy to mining.  However, other schools (e.g. Shafi'ite, Hanabilite) regarded troves and mining as subject only to the conventional rates (e.g. zakat). Curiously, the prominence of Hanafi school in the west led to the institutionalization of the tax in Muslim states in Spain.  After the reconquista, the Christian states of Castile, Portugal, etc. adopted the tax themselves as the quinto real (""royal fifth"").  It became an important part of crown finance for the Iberian monarchies, and was extended to their overseas empires in the Americas, Africa and Asia. As zakat is earmarked for redistribution to the poor, the jizyah, kharaj and ushr were the only real sources of revenue for the government.  This led to the paradox that the greater the amount of conversions into Islam, the smaller the tax revenues (the ushr rate is lower than the kharaj rate).  For this reason, we find several instances in history when Caliphs tried to dissuade further conversions or forbid the transfer of property from non-Muslims to Muslims and even to just disregard the law and apply jizyah and kharaj taxes on certain segments of the Muslim population (see above for the historical account). To make up for this ""deficiency"" in tax base, some legal schools recognize that the state can ""sell"" its ""services"" and has the right to ""charge"" for them in the form of taxes, duties, etc.  However, whether it can compel such payments is a point of contention.  In principle, at least, ""trade"", even between State and citizen, must follow all the laws of commerce, e.g. it must be mutually agreed upon, transparent, no asymmetries in information, etc.  Monetary policy is implicated in this.  By outlawing gold-for-gold usury, seignorage was forbidden: as much gold must be given back as coins as is submitted in ingots (although scholars allow a fee to cover minting costs).  Many jurisst considered debasing currency is considered to be pure theft and fraud.  Government borrowing was also difficult, as interest could not be paid and, for most government activities, there is no clear ""profit"" to be shared. Of course, Muslim princes violated this repeatedly, or simply borrowed from non-Muslims.     Foreign Commerce The predisposition of Islam towards commerce extends, perhaps unsurprisingly, to foreign commerce as well.  While European princes were erecting all sorts of protective barriers to keep out long-distance trade and ""protect"" locals from the vicissitudes of the market, the princes of the Islamic kingdoms were bending over backwards to encourage foreign merchants to come trade and settle in their lands. As mentioned, the Prophet and many his early companions were merchants, and  7th C. Mecca was an important commercial entrepot for foreign trade, so there was from outset a decent respect, socially and in the law, for foreign trade, if not quite a theory of it. Even after trade routes changed, the Hajj, the obligatory pilgrimage to Mecca, brought Muslims together from the far-flung corners of the world, bringing with them information about different lands, resources and trading opportunities.  Foreign business deals and partnerships were often struck up between merchants on the pilgrimage. Arab merchants themselves extended trade (and their religion) well beyond the political boundaries, to India, Central Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia.  And that respect was extended to others - Armenians and Jews lived and traded virtually unhampered throughout the Muslim empires. The Arab historian and social philosopher, Ibn Khaldun (1377) was quick to point out the link between commercial enterprise, capital accumulation and the well-being of a kingdom. Khaldun warned princes of the ruinous long-term consequences of trying to interfere in the economic affairs and trade of private citizens.   By geographic happenstance, Muslim lands lay exactly on the trade routes between Europe, Africa and Asia and everybody knew that the fortunes of the state rose and fell with the volume of trade that passed through it.   As such, Muslim princes were not completely devoid of mercantilist instincts, and undertook various efforts to ensuring that trade routes passed through their territories rather than their rivals.  This sometimes meant wars to control ports and shipping lanes or making exclusive deals with specific groups of foreign traders, e.g. Mameluke sultanate of Egypt with the Venetian Republic, the Persian Il-Khanate with the Genoese, the Ottoman empire with the Levant Company, which often entailed freezing out other foreign competitors.

Michael T. Sadler, 1780-1835 ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sadler.htm," English businessman from Yorkshire, radical Tory MP and leader of the factory reform movement.  Elected to parliament in 1829, Michael T. Sadler is perhaps best known for his campaign to limit work hours and improve conditions for child laborers.  Although unsuccessful during his parliamentary term (cut short by the parliamentary reform of 1832 - Sadler lost his seat), the campaign he started and the evidence he gathered eventually led to the new laws curbing child labor. In economics, Sadler's main claim to fame is his 1830 Law of Population.  Malthus's old population doctrine recently had come under attack by Nassau William Senior in 1829,  who posited instead the ""demographic transition"", that fertility actually declines with prosperity as people naturally preferred to limit their families in order to achieve a ""better"" standard of living for themselves.  As Senior's argument gained ground against Malthus's, Sadler leaped into the fray with what seemed like a compromise, and proposed in his 1830 treatise, a modification of the Malthusian law, suggesting that population growth depended not only on food (as Malthus proposed), but also on space (Sadler's addition).  Thus the Malthusian law, Sadler proposed, would be weaker in places with greater population density (""the prolificness of otherwise similarly circumstanced, varies with their numbers"", v.2, p.352).  As wealthier countries and places tended to have greater population density, it only seemed like fertility rates declined with wealth.  Sadler did not really explain the basis of his case - his voluminous work reviewed many of the past arguments about fertility, but he did not really connect the population density argument to them.  He simply assumed that population growth was greater in the countryside than in the cities.  Sadler's argument was famously attacked by Thomas Macaulay in the Edinburgh Review and George Poulett Scrope in the Quarterly Review.      Major Works of Michael Sadler     Resources on Michael T.

Educated in the provinces, Guérineau de Saint-Péravy (or Saint-Péravi) moved to Paris, seeking out a patron for a literary career, publishing a few romantic-melancholic poems which earned critical praise. He came under the influence of Quesnay's followers and became an ardent Physiocrat and contributed to their journals.  Saint-Péravy may have been 'Mr. K' in the Dupont de Nemours-edited Journal de l'agriculture, du commerce et des finances. Saint-Péravy is chiefly remembered for his 1768 Mémoire on indirect taxation, which he decried in favor of the Physiocratic 'single tax' on land.  It was submitted to a 1767 competition set up by the Société Royale d'Agriculture of Limoges (then headed by Jacques Turgot). It competed with an essay by Graslin in defense of indirect taxes, insisting that the produit net came from both agriculture and industry. Graslin lost out to Saint-Péravy, but both essays were carefully reviewed by Turgot.  In 1783, Saint-Peravy moved to Belgium, where he launched a literary journal, the Poëte voyageur.  In 1786, Saint-Peravy anonymously published his Principes de Commerce (1786-7), which, according to Viner (1937), contained one of the earliest articulations of the 'forced savings' doctrine.

In 1712, he accompanied the French ambassador Cardinal de Polignac to the peace conference at Utrecht to put an end to the long War of Spanish Succession. The difficulties presented by the negotiations of the final treaty prompted his most famous tract, the Projét de paix perpétuelle, an outline of idealistic system of international conferences and organizations, which would resolve conflicts by argument and arbitration rather than war (which Saint-Pierre rooted in a proposal by Sully & Henry IV a century earlier). Thereafter, Saint-Pierre's life as a prolific writer (usually signed) on reform took wing, proposing scheme after scheme for overhauling government, administration, economy and social institutions usually along fully reasoned, if idealistic,  presaging much of the optimistic Enlightenment spirit to come.  A humanitarian social analyst, Saint-Pierre sought to explain phenomena like poverty in terms of circumstance and luck, rather than Divine retribution or moral failure, and set out projects to address and mitigate such circumstances. Saint-Pierre's numerous schemes were often bogged in pedantic detail, e.g. the operation of a government bureaus to solve theological disputes, the minutiae of educating monarchs, establishing girls' schools, or running a charity, etc.  But some were prescient, e.g. in 1717, the Abbé de Saint-Pierre set out a proposal for a taille tarifée, a proportional income tax, to substitute the arbitrary tax assessment.  Saint-Pierre's discourse on Polysynodie, extolling the government by councils (as practiced during much of the Orleanist regency) was unfortunately conjoined with an unbridled condemnation of the prior government and policies of Louis XIV.  Saint-Pierre's rant was met coldly, and he was promptly expelled from the Acadèmie française in 1718. Saint-Pierre was a leading member of the 1720s 'Club d'Entresol' of Abbé Alary in Paris, which included other early  Enlightenment  figures such as René Louis de Voyer, Marquis d'Argenson, which was closed down in 1731 by order of Cardinal Fleury.  In 1733, Saint-Pierre began putting out his Ouvrajes, containing his numerous schemes and thoughts into print. After his death in 1743, Saint-Pierre's nephew dispatched the remaining mountain of manuscripts to Jean-Jacques Rousseau to sort through. Rousseau was immensely influenced by Saint-Pierre's work, although deriding him as pedantic and shallow.   Upon his death, the Academie's ban was still in force, which prevented the usual eulogy to be delivered.   When the ban was finally lifted, three decades later, d'Alembert took it upon himself to deliver the belated eulogy at the Academie.

"Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon", 1760-1825,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/saintsimon.htm,"Ruined aristocrat, an officer in the American Revolution war, a real estate speculator and journalist, Henri de Saint-Simon is reknowned as the  founder of the ""Saint-Simonian"" movement, a type of semi-mystical ""Christian-Scientific"" socialism that pervaded the 19th Century.  Saint-Simon envisaged the reorganization of society with an elite of philosophers, engineers and scientists leading a peaceful process of industrialization tamed by their ""rational"" Christian-Humanism. His advocacy of a ""New Christianity"" -- a secular humanist religion to replace the defunct traditional religions -- was to have scientists as priests. This priestly task was actually taken up by two of his followers -- Barthelemy-Prosper Enfantin (1796-1864) and Saint-Amand Bazard (1791-1832) -- who infected the whole movement with their bizarre mysticism and ritual.    Saint-Simon was crucial for the development of the social sciences:  his call for a ""science of society"" on the same footing as the natural sciences, was highly influential on his disciple Auguste Comte and the sociologists and was the primary cause of the scientific pretensions of economics.  One could count Thomas Carlyle, Michel Chevalier, John Stuart Mill and the young Léon Walras as adherents of Saint-Simonism.    Saint-Simon's vision was highly influential on French society ( and more generally, throughout Europe) all through the 19th Century, including the Emperor Napoleon III.  The political highwater-mark of Saint-Simonism was perhaps the French July Revolution of 1830.  But the influence of Saint-Simonism on future versions of socialism was more pronounced.  Saint-Simon's ""scientism"" was particularly influential on the development of Marxian doctrine -- and,  for that same reason, Saint-Simon was condemned by Hayek (1952).   Although Saint-Simon was one of the first to identify the process of ""industrialization"" as it was happening in Europe, his concern with the laboring classes was more reserved, although noting the ""unnaturalness"" of unemployment.  In general, Saint-Simon's bourgeois elitism distinguished him from the later more ""labor-orientated""  socialist thinkers -- notably those radicalized by the 1848 Revolution, such as Louis Blanc and P.J. Proudhon.  Indeed, Saint-Simon's enthusiasm for the ""spontaneous harmony"" of the ""organism"" of industrial society has led some to claim that he was really a Classical Liberal in disguise.  The famed Saint-Simonian critique on private property (as well as the mystical glitter) was due more to his followers (notably Enfantin) than himself. But Saint-Simon was clearly a dirigiste in economic policy matters.        Major Works of Henri de Saint-Simon     Resources on Saint-Simon     All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Paul A. Samuelson, 1915-2009,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/samuelson.htm," Perhaps more than anyone else, Paul A. Samuelson has personified mainstream economics in the second half of the twentieth century. The writer of the most successful principles textbook ever (1948), Paul Samuelson has been not unjustly considered the incarnation of the economics ""establishment"" - and as a result, has been both lauded and vilified for virtually everything right and wrong about it. Samuelson's most famous piece of work, Foundations of Economic Analysis (1947), one of the grand tomes that helped revive Neoclassical economics and launched the era of the mathematization of economics.  Samuelson was one of the progenitors of the Paretian revival   in microeconomics and the Neo-Keynesian Synthesis in macroeconomics during the post-war period. Originating from Gary, Indiana and growing up in Chicago, Paul Anthony Samuelson enrolled at the University of Chicago in 1932, and received his B.A. in 1935.  He went on to enroll at Harvard, receiving his MA in 1936 and his Ph.D in 1941.  His thesis would become the Foundations of Economic Analysis (1947). Samuelson was the wunderkind of the Harvard generation of 1930s, where he studied under Joseph Schumpeter, Wassily Leontief, Gottfried Haberler, Alvin Hansen and (his mathematical mentor) Edwin Bidwell Wilson.  Samuelson had a prodigious grasp of economic theory which has since become legendary (an unconfirmed anecdote has it that at the end of Samuelson's dissertation defense, Schumpeter turned to Leontief and asked, ""Well, Wassily, have we passed?"").  For unclear reasons, Samuelson was not given an offer to stay at Harvard, so he moved down the avenue to M.I.T. in 1940, and never looked back.  At that time, M.I.T. was a relative backwater in economics. Samuelson went on to build one of the century's most powerful economics departments around himself.  He was soon joined by Robert M. Solow who was to become Samuelson's sometime co-writer and partner-in-crime. Samuelson's specific contributions to economics have been far too many to be listed here - being among the most prolific writers in economics. Samuelson's signature method of economic theory, illustrated in his Foundations (1947), seems to follow two rules which can also been said to characterize much of Neoclassical economics since: with every economic problem (1) reduce the number of variables and keep only a minimum set of simple economic relations; (2) if possible, rewrite it as a constrained optimization problem. In microeconomics, he is responsible for the theory of revealed preference (1938, 1947).  This and his  related efforts on the question of utility measurement and integrability (1937, 1950) opened the way for future developments by Debreu, Georgescu-Roegen and Uzawa. He also introduced the use of comparative statics and dynamics through his ""correspondence principle"" (1947) which was applied fruitfully in his contributions to the dynamic stability of general equilibrium (1941, 1944). He also developed what are now called ""Bergson-Samuelson social welfare functions"" (1947, 1950, 1956) and, no less famously, Samuelson is responsible for the harnessing of ""public goods"" into Neoclassical theory (1954, 1955, 1958). Samuelson was also instrumental in establishing the modern theory of theory of production.  His Foundations (1947) are responsible for the envelope theorem and the full characterization of the cost function.  He also made important contributions to the theory of technical progress (1972).   His work on the theory of capital is also well known, if contentious.  He demonstrated one of the first remarkable ""Non-Substitution"" theorems (1951) and, in his famous paper with Solow (1953), initiated the analysis of dynamic Leontief systems. This work was famously reiterated in his famous 1958 volume on linear programming with Robert Dorfman and Robert Solow, wherein we also find a clear introduction to the ""turnpike"" conjecture of linear von Neumann systems.  Samuelson was also Joan Robinson's main adversary in the Cambridge Capital Controversy - introducing the ""surrogate"" production function (1962), and then subsequently (and graciously) relenting (1966). In international trade theory, he is responsible for the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem (1941) and, independently of Lerner, the Factor Price Equalization theorem (1948, 1949, 1953) as well as (finally) resolving the age-old ""transfer problem"" relating terms of trade and capital flows as well as the Marxian transformation problem (1971) and other issues in Classical economics (1957, 1978). In macroeconomics, Samuelson's multiplier-accelerator macrodynamic model (1939) is justly famous, as is his presentation of the Phillips Curve (1960) to the world. He is also famous for popularizing Allais's ""overlapping generations"" model which has since found many applications in macroeconomics and monetary theory. In many ways, his work on speculative prices (1965) effectively anticipates the efficient markets hypothesis in finance theory. His work on diversification (1967) and the ""lifetime portfolio"" (1969) is also well known. Paul Samuelson's many contributions to Neoclassical economic theory were recognized with a Nobel Memorial prize in 1970.         Major Works of Paul A.

Santerna's wrote perhaps the first treatise on maritime insurance theory and law, c.1488, although it was only published in 1552 (in Venice, through a certain Balthazar Constantini).  It was an immediate sensation in merchant circles and went through various editions (Antwerp, 1554; Lyons, 1556, 1579).  Santerna challenged the prevailing view, promulgated by the Church, that viewed an essential coincidence between insurance with usury or gambling.  His treatise explains the motives, practice and consequences of maritime insurance and calls for the lifting of the prohibitions on insurance.  His work was extensively commented upon by Benvenuto Stracca and frequently printed conjointly with the latter.

Friedrich Carl Savigny, 1779-1861.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/savigny.htm," Magisterial German jurist, founder of the ""historical school"" of jurisprudence.  A native of Frankfurt (Hessen), descending from a family of French Protestants, Friedrich Carl von Savigny studied at Marburg and Göttingen.  He went on to become professor of civil law at the University of Berlin, from 1810 to 1842, and a judge on the Prussian court of appeals.  He subsequently served in the Prussian cabinet as the minister for the revision of laws from 1843 until 1848. F.C. von Savigny is perhaps best known for his 1814 pamphlet disputing proposals to codify German civil law, which had arisen in the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars.  Savigny formulated an ""organic"" theory of legal and social co-evolution, arguing that an ""idealist"" or ""rationalist"" system of law, ""imposed"" from above, would inevitably fail to take root.  As a result, Savigny argued that a ""scientific"" jurisprudence must necessarily be approached with a historical sense, first and foremost, to understand the interface between legal institutions and the Volksgeist (the spirit of a nation) in operation at that particular time and place.  A systematic sense is useful, but only afterwards.    At the University of Berlin, Savigny challenged the dominance of the philosopher Georg W.F. Hegel and his followers.  While Hegel had regarded history as an unfolding progress of ideas, Savigny emphasized the differences in historical periods. Savigny was highly influential on the German historical school of economics. In jurisprudential circles, Savigny is also famous for his treatise on possessions (1803), his monumental critical history of Roman Law in the Middle Ages (1815-31) and his examination of modern Roman law (1840-49).

Horace Émile Say, 1794-1860,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/horacesay.htm,"French businessman, liberal activist and statesman, the eldest son of Jean-Baptiste Say.   Horace Émile Say was born in Paris, and studied in Geneva, before entering his father's sugar-processing business. As an agent for the family company, Horace left France in 1813, and after visiting the United States, lived in Brazil for several years.  Returning to Paris, Horace Say founded a trading company to South America in 1818.  Horace Say was primarily a businessmen, whose time (esp. later in life) was mostly involved in various civic duties, becoming president of the chamber of commerce in 1834.  Horace Émile Say's own economic skills were primarily empirically-oriented.  Besides his historical treatise on French-Brazilian commerce, Horace produced a series of studies on Paris city administration, finances and, between 1848 and 1851, oversaw a herculean effort to collect statistical data on industry in the Paris region.   In several ways, at least methodologically, Horace Say be seen as as a French Historicist.  But Horace Say was also a dutiful son, and an important sponsor and member of the  French Liberal School.  Horace Say helped found the Parisian publishing house of Guillaumin in 1840, the Journal des économistes in 1841 and the Société d'Économie Politique in 1842.  He edited and put out new editions of his father's works through the 1840s, and contributed numerous articles to Guillaumin's 1852 Dictionnaire de l'économie politique.

Jean-Baptiste Say, 1767-1832.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/say.htm," Leading 19th C. French Classical economist, often considered the father of the  French Liberal School Jean-Baptiste Say was born in Lyons to a family of textile merchants of Huguenot extraction.  The Say family was originally from Nimes, but had to move to Geneva after Louis XIV ended toleration of protestants in 1685.  Jean-Baptiste's father, Jean-Estienne Say, returned to France in the 1750s, settling down in Lyons and entering the silk trade.  Jean-Baptiste was born in Lyons on January 5, 1767.  At the age of nine, Jean-Baptiste Say was sent to an unorthodox school in Écully (outside of Lyons), but his education was cut short when the school was shut down by ecclesiastical authorities.  His father's business difficulties soon forced the family to relocate to Paris in 1780/82, where his father tried to reinvent himself as a currency trader .  At the age of fifteen,  Jean-Baptiste was apprenticed to a banking house in Paris, and in 1785, now eighteen, Jean-Baptiste and his brother Horace were sent by to England to complete their commercial education. After two years in England apprenticed to a overseas trading company in Croydon, Jean-Baptiste Say returned to France in 1787 and took a job at an insurance company in Paris run by Étienne Clavière.  A Genevan Protestant like himself, Clavière was to be highly influential on the formation of young Say, and instilled in the latter his radical revolutionary notions.  It was Clavière who urged Say to study political economy, and lent him his copy of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, which made a deep impression on the young Say. (Claviere would later serve as Minister of Finance in the brief Girondiste ministry of the Spring of 1792, and appointed Jean-Baptiste's father, Jean-Etienne Say, to the board overseeing the issue of assignats - just as their value was about to collapse dramatically, ruining Say a second time.)  Jean-Baptiste Say was overjoyed by the French Revolution, and took to print immediately in 1789 with a pamphlet defending the freedom of the press - a pamphlet he later derided as immature scribblings. Nonetheless, it brought him to the attention of the Comte de Mirabeau, who hired Say on the staff for his newspaper, Le Courrier de Provence.  In 1792, now an ardent republican, Say enlisted as a volunteer in Parisian military company and served in a military campaign in Champagne to repulse the allied armies from France.  After his return from service, in May 1793, Say married Julie Jourdel-Deloches, the daughter of a prominent Parisian lawyer.  This was at the height of the Terror period, and Say and his new bride took refuge in the small village of Noisy-le-Sec (near Paris).  There Say entertained the notion of establishing a school, before some of his friends, aware of his aspirations as a writer, persuaded him to join their project of establishing a new literary review. In 1794, Say became one of the founders and managing editor of  La Décade philosophique, arguably the first significant review to emerge after the Terror period. Politically, it was a refuge for the young republican intelligentsia, eager to preserve the gains of the revolution from both extremes of Royalism and Jacobinism.  Intellectually, it harked back to reviving the Enlightenment spirit in republican France.  The journal served as the bastion of the idéologues, in the tradition of Condillac and Destutt de Tracy, who sought to base the study of man and society in the sciences, albeit looking to physiology (rather than mechanics or mathematics) for inspiration.  Unlike other comparable periodicals, the Décade placed a heavy emphasis on articles reviewing works in the natural sciences and especially medicine and physiology.  The liberal, scientifically-oriented Decade maintained a heated rivalry with the conservative and more literary-minded Mercure de France of Fontanes and Chateaubriand (although both would eventually merge in 1807, forming the Revue philosophique).  The ideologues flourished during the Directorate period of the late 1790s, many of them were drafted as government consultants or into important positions in the ministries.  At the helm of the Decade as editor-in-chief from 1794 to 1799, Say wrote about everything (under a variety of pen-names, e.g. ""Boniface Véridick"").  The economic articles in the Décade were in Enlightenment liberal tradition and usually supportive of Directory policies.  His 1800 essay, Olbie, was submitted to a contest run by the Institut de France.  But the ideologues began losing their access to power with the advent of Napoleon Bonaparte's Consulate in late 1799.  At the outset, they perceived Napoleon sympathetically, a champion against the extremes, and Napoleon appointed legions of ideologues to the newly-formed Tribunate in early 1800, a council of intellectual notables responsible for reviewing legislation before it was submitted for a vote.  Jean-Baptiste Say was one of these, appointed as Tribune in December, 1799, attached to the section of finances. He would serve as a Tribune until 1804.  But the honeymoon between Bonaparte and ideologues did not last long.  The intellectuals in the Tribunate, led by Benjamin Constant, wary of the growing dictatorship, soon formed a locus of political opposition to the new regime.  Although Say survived Napoleon's 1802 purge of the Tribunate, he grew disenchanted with the direction things were heading, in particular the rising taxes, public debt and gradual abandonment of free trade principles by the Bonapartist regime. It was partly in the hope of setting things right again that Jean-Baptiste Say wrote his great opus, the Traité d'économie politique in 1803. Already in his 1800 essay, Olbie, which was written and submitted to a contest run by the Institut de France, before he became tribune, Say had emphasized the importance of education in political economy, and lamented the lack of an good treatise that would make economics accessible to the general public (p.10n).  The Traité was intended to fill that vacuum.  It became a very successful treatise, arguably the first popular textbook on economics.  It would go through several editions (1803, 1814, 1817, 1819, 1826, etc.), with great revisions of content, and would be translated into multiple languages (an English translation of the fourth edition appeared in 1821).  Say's treatise is frequently (but unfairly) characterized as merely a popularization of Adam Smith's economics.  This is partly because of the clarity and simplicity of Say's writing style, which has led critics to accuse him of superficiality or vulgarization. But, as Schumpeter notes, the truth is the reverse: Say's treatise is profundity parading as triviality, that its deceptive simplicity conceals its deep original insights and that Say's economics owes less to Smith and more to the French tradition of Cantillon and Turgot (Rothbard calls it ""the French tradition in Smithian clothing""). The old Physiocrat Dupont de Nemours, writing to Say in 1815, believed it consonant to his own work. Say's distinctive economics was an outcome of a muddled marriage of Condillac's utility theory of demand and Adam Smith's cost theory of supply.  Value, Say claimed (with some inconsistency), was the outcome of the interaction of these two.   In this respect, it departs considerably from the Classical School, where value is determined purely from the cost side.  Say's approach would be later taken up by French Liberal School and he can be considered a precursor of the Marginalist Revolution.  Like Cantillon before him and the Austrian School after him, Say also placed great emphasis on the risk-taking entrepreneur and even tried to include him as the ""fourth"" factor of production in his analysis. It was also in the Treatise that Say outlined his famous ""Law of Markets"".  Roughly stated, Say's Law claims that total demand in an economy cannot exceed or fall below total supply in that economy or as James Mill was to restate it, ""supply creates its own demand.""  In Say's language, ""products are paid for with products"" (1803: p.153) or ""a glut can take place only when there are too many means of production applied to one kind of product and not enough to another"", (1803: p.178-9.).  Or: ""It is worth while to remark, that a product is no sooner created, than it, from that instant, affords a market for other products to the full extent of its own value.   When the producer has put the finishing hand to his product, he is most anxious to sell it immediately, lest its value should diminish in his hands.  Nor is he less anxious to dispose of the money he may get for it; for the value of money is also perishable.  But the only way of getting rid of money is in the purchase of some product or other.  Thus the mere circumstance of creation of one product immediately opens a vent for other products."" (J.B. Say, 1803: p.138-9) The radical laissez-faire notions expounded in the 1803 Treatise caught the attention of Napoleon Bonaparte himself.  Summoning Say to a private meeting, Napoleon demanded that Say rewrite parts of the Treatise to conform with his attempt at creating a war economy, built on protectionism and regulation.  Say refused.  Napoleon proscribed the Treatise and had Say ousted from the Tribunate in 1804. Although offered another government post in the taxation bureaucracy as compensation, Say was too disgusted by the imperial regime to consider it, and decided to strike out as private entrepreneur.  In July 1804, Say set about establishing a cotton-spinning mill at Maubuisson Abbey in the Val d'Oise (northwest of Paris), then, before the end of the year, decided to move to northern France to set up a larger cotton mill with an associate at Auchy-les-Hesdins (near Pas-de-Calais).  Say and his family would remain in Auchy for the next few years, concentrating on his business and growing fabulously rich.  Say's enterprise nonetheless felt the pinch of the wartime Continental blockade.  In 1812, Say sold his shares to his partner, and returned to Paris, living as a speculator.  After the fall of Napoleon in 1814, Say finally published a much-revised and enlarged second edition of the Traité   He then spent some time in England, ostensibly to observe the state of post-war industry.  There, Say met Ricardo, Bentham, Malthus and Godwin,  and, upon his return in 1815, published his reflections on England and the English.  Around the same time, Say published a small tract, the Catéchisme, a simple exposition and conveyance of economic principles for the general public, in the form of questions and answers. Although virulently opposed to Bonaparte, Say was not enthusiastic about the restoration of the monarchy, and contemplated emigrating to America.  He open a correspondence with American ex-president Thomas Jefferson in 1815, inquiring about conditions in Virginia, but now approaching fifty, realized it would be a difficult transition.  Despite his old republican credentials, the restored Bourbon government showered Say with numerous dignities and honors.  In 1816,  he was invited him to deliver a course of lectures on economics at l'Athénée Royale, a private college.  In 1819, Say was appointed as Chair of Industrial Economy at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers.  His popular lectures at the Conservatoire would be published in 1828 (Cours complet). Say's Law of Markets came to divide economists in the General Glut Controversy, which broke out around 1819-20.  Say joined in the fray, attacking the underconsumption thesis in his letters to Malthus (1820) and in his 1824 exchange with rival countryman Simonde de Sismondi in the Revue Encyclopédique.  The centrality of Say's contributions in this debate led finally to the first English translation of Say's treatise in 1821.  Say was dissatisfied with the British translator Prinsep, who had taken the liberty of inserting editorial notes connecting Say arguments to Ricardo, and translating terms in a way that gave the Treatise an overtly Ricardian tinge. Say much preferred the contemporary American translation by Biddle.      In March 1831, Say was granted a chair (the first in political economy) at the prestigious Collège de France in Paris. He gave a full course of lectures in 1831-32, but died a few weeks into his second year.   The French Liberal School followed up on Say.      Major Works of Jean-Baptiste Say   Resources on J.B.

Léon Say, 1826-1896.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/leonsay.htm," French liberal and prominent statesmen. Jean-Baptiste Léon Say (commonly referred to as Léon Say, to avoid confusion with his grandfather) was the son of prominent  liberal Horace Émile Say and grandson of the great classical economist Jean-Baptiste Say.  Educated at the College Bourbon, the Léon Say was a firm republican and a strident anti-Bonapartiste. During the 1848 Revolution, the young Léon Say enrolled in the National Guard. He opposed Louis Napoleon's ascent to power and the establishment of the Second Empire.  He would would later join the Union Libérale with Adolphe Thiers, Jules Favre and Prévost-Paradol to oppose Napoleon III. Léon Say published his first economics work, a history of Caisse d'éscompte, in 1848, earning himself a position in the Eichtal bank in 1850.  From 1852, he worked as a manager at the French Lyon Railway, then from 1857 at the French Nord Railway.  But he found time for writing, and after 1855 began making a name for himself in the pages of the Journal des Débats (he went on to marry the proprietor's Bertin's daughter, and taking over the periodical in 1870).  He famously raked Baron Haussman, the prefect of Paris, then re-modeling the city for the emperor, over the financing of his projects (e.g.1865, 1868).  He was also involved in the ""cooperatives"" movement with Léon Walras and others (1866). Léon Say returned to politics after 1871, with the advent of the Third Republic. He served as finance minister in multiple cabinets -  1872-73 in the government of Adolphe Thiers, in 1875 under Louis Buffet, in 1877-79 during the presidency of MacMahon and 1882 under Jules Grévy.  As finance minister, Say was saddled with the monumental task of figuring out how to pay the hefty war indemnity to Germany (1875). He was Senator of France from 1875 to 1882 (and Prefect of the Seine, Haussman's old position, from 1876). He was elected president of the International Monetary Conference of 1878, and in 1880 was sent as ambassador to London to negotiate a commercial treaty. A French liberal of the old laissez faire stripe, Léon Say spent much of his later years opposing the rising tide of socialists and protectionists, and made himself a lightning rod for their furor.  Say got himself elected to the lower Chamber of Deputies in 1889, but was unable to fend off the protectionist Méline tariff of 1892, that brought to end the liberal era of free trade launched by Chevalier back in 1860.  Léon Say died in April, 1896, just a few days before Jules Méline became the prime minister of France.       Major Works of Léon Say     Resources on Léon Say   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Emil Sax, 1845-1927,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sax.htm,"Austrian economist, with historicist tendencies. Emil Sax was born in Jauernig-Johanesberg (modern Javornik, Czech Republic, then part of Austro-Hungarian Silesia). In 1862, he enrolled at the University of Vienna to study law and political science (Staatswissenschaften). He interrupted his studies to serve as secretary to the Austrian commission to the Paris World Exhibition, obtaining his doctorate only in 1868. He subsequently worked as a legal intern at the Vienna Chamber of Commerce and then at a Viennese bank.  He got his habilitation at Vienna and in 1870 started lecturing as a privat-dozent (assistant) in economics at the Polytechnic Institute of Vienna.  Sax published his lectures on railway economics in 1871, earning him a small reputation as an expert on the topic.  In 1873, Sax was appointed secretary to the director of Austrian railway company (Kaiser Ferdinand-Nordbahn), a job he would retain for the next six years. The very next year, 1874, Lorenz von Stein approved his habilitation at the University of Vienna, and Sax began lecturing (again as privat-dozent) on economics and public finance at the University of Vienna. As his earnings as a lecturer were meager, Sax retained his railway company job, while waiting for a salaried academic job.  Emil Sax was only a little younger than Carl Menger, whom he got to know better during this period.  Sax's two volume work on transportation economics was well-received and put him in a strong position for the next opening. The break came in 1879, when the University of Vienna decided to offer Sax an extraordinary (associate) professorship, while offering Menger an ordinary (full) professorship. Realizing that moving up at Vienna was not likely anytime soon, and perhaps a little miffed, Emil Sax decided to decline the Vienna post, and instead moved to Prague, to accept the extraordinary professorship of political economy at the (German-speaking) University of Prague   Sax was subsequently tenured as full professor in 1880, and would go on to become dean of its law faculty in 1888 and rector of the University of Prague in 1892. During this period, Sax also dabbled in politics. For a time (1879-85), Sax served as a deputy of the German Liberal Party (DLP) in the Austrian House of Deputies.. Emil Sax retired prematurely from Prague in 1893 for health reason (he was suffering from increasing deafness).  Sax went into seclusion for the rest of his life in the remote village of Volosca (near Abbazia), on the Istrian coast, writing next to nothing for the next two decades. But he burst back into print in the last stretch of his life. Although part of Menger's circle at Vienna, and so sometimes regarded as part of the ""first generation"" of the Austrian School, Emil Sax was never a proper footsoldier of the school, and he distanced himself from their theoretical and methodological stance. Sax's 1884 book was supportive of Menger in the immediate heat of the methodenstreit with the the German Historical School.  But the support came with reservations, and Sax elaborated upon his differences from the Austrian position in his subsequent 1887 treatise. Sax elaborated a theory of public goods and social welfare that went well beyond the individualist approach of Austrian economics.  In his own research, Emil Sax preferred to concentrate on applied fields like public finance, housing and transportation.   His ideological stance, particularly on the role of the State in the economy, was probably closer to the Historicists.  Sax pulled fewer punches against the younger members of the Austrian school - criticizing Mayer's theory of taxation in 1892, and in his 1916 book, Sax produced an outspoken critique of Böhm-Bawerk's theory of capital.

Herbert E. Scarf, 1930-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/scarf.htm,"  Prominent Yale economist who pioneered the use of numeric algorithms to facilitate the ""computation"" of equilibrium in general equilibrium systems.  His approximation method to fixed points using simplicial subdivision was announced in 1967 and became the basis for famous 1973 monograph on Computation of Equlibrium, which launched the whole area of applied general equilibrium theory. Scarf also provided the first proof of the non-emptiness of the Edgeworth's ""core"" in 1967. He had previously provided in 1962, followed by joint work with Debreu in 1963, the core convergence theorem for a replicated economy.  His counterexamples of stability of equilibrium (1960) helped, in several ways, to bury that research program. He is also reknowned for his work on (S, s) inventory policy (1959).   In his later work, Scarf tackled the problem of production sets with indivisibilities (i.e. non-convexities), a problem that has bedeviled production and equilibrium theory for a while -- indivisibilities, after all, are the justification for technical increasing returns to scale.  Resurrecting a result that he had found in 1963, Herbert Scarf (1986)  noted that when such non-convex production sets are used, the non-emptiness of the core is not guaranteed.  In order to handle non-convex production sets, Scarf has developed the method of ""integral"" activity analysis (e.g. Scarf, 1981, 1986, 1994).

Albert Schäffle, 1831-1903,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/schaffle.htm," Albert Everhard Friedrich Schäffle (or Schaeffle) was an German economist at Tübingen and Vienna, part of the German Historical School, on the older end of the ""younger generation"". Born in Nürtingen, Wüttemberg. Albert (not Albrecht) Schäffle studied at Tübingen  He launched a career as a journalist, working for nearly a decade at the Schwäbischer Merkur, before becoming professor of national economy (Nationalökonomie) at the University of Tübingen in 1860. He participated in politics, and was a member of the Wüttemberg parliament in the 1860s. In 1868, Schäffle moved to Austria to take up a professorship at the University of Vienna. There he was the teacher of future Austrian economists Carl Menger, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, Friedrich von Wieser.  Schäffle resigned his position abruptly in February 1871, to join the Austrian government as minister of commerce in the short-lived cabinet of federalist Sigmund Hohenwart.  However, after the government collapsed by October, 1871,  Schäffle did not (or could not) resume his professorship at Vienna, and retired to Stuttgart on a state pension.  He would spend the ample remainder of his life dedicated to writing. (The sudden availability of the Vienna chair in 1871 cleared the way for Carl Menger, who had just submitted his Grundsätze as his habilitation thesis at Vienna, to assume the chair in political economy at Vienna provisionally in 1873 (in full after 1879), and lead the Austrian School.of economics from that perch.) In Bau und Leben (1874), oft-considered his magnum opus, Schäffle articulated his vision of society as a living organism, relying on the use of biological analogies.  More popularly, Schaeffle's Quintessenz des Socialismus, proved to be a best-selling exposition of the socialist movement.  He condemned the socialists for their unrealistic plans - in particular, their inability to account for individual incentives (something he would mull over in more detail in his 1885 book on social democracy).  But Schaffle was no laissez faire liberal, but a standard-bearer of the German Historical School and its State interventionist ideal of a mixed or ""managed capitalism"", curbing the excesses of the impact on labor with active government policies. As part of the Tübingen faculty, Schäffle had been an editor of the house journal Zeitschrift für gesamte Staatswissenschaft (ZGS, literally ""Journal of All the Political Sciences"", aka ""Tübinger Zeitschfirt"", f.1844, now recast as the Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE)), alongside political scientist Gustav von Schönberg and Karl Viktor Fricker.  But Schäffle soon began giving it a more economic-oriented tone, especially after Adolphe Wagner joined as editor in 1878.  Schäffle edited the ZGS alone by himself from 1892 to 1901, when he finally passed on the duties to Karl  Bücher.

Thomas C. Schelling, 1921-2016,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/schelling.htm," Innovative applied game theorist. Originating from Oakland, California, Thomas C. Schelling obtained his BA from Berkeley and his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1951.  After a period as an adviser at the White House and several government agencies, Schelling joined the faculty at Yale in 1953, an subsequently Harvard in 1958, where he remained until 1990.   He has been a professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, since. Schelling most influential work, developed during an interlude at RAND corporation in 1958-59, is his Strategy of Conflict (1960) applying game-theoretic concepts to the analysis of real world situations, building up to international relations and military strategy, often deriving unintuitive and surprising conclusions.  His 1978 book is no less masterly, using game theory  to show how aggregate behavior, mass phenomena and institutions can emerge from small, seemingly inconsequential changes in individual behavior.  A famous example is the inadvertent emergence of racial segregation in cities where the population does not have deep racial prejudices.  Although firmly attached to rational choice, Schelling has sometimes been classified as a behavioral economist. Thomas Schelling won the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics in 2005, with Robert Aumann, ""for having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis"".

Karl Schlesinger, 1889-1938.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/schlesinger.htm,"Hungarian-born Austrian banker and economist with a mathematical bent. Karl Schlesinger studied at the University of Vienna, and resurrected Walras's theory of encaisse desirée in his relatively overlooked 1914 dissertation, written under Böhm-Bawerk. Schlesinger fled Budapest in 1919, in the turmoil of the Hungarian socialist revolution of Bela Kun, and went on to establish a rather successful bank in Vienna.  Schlesinger participated in von Mises's Austrian economics seminar in Vienna and sought out Karl Menger as a tutor in mathematics in 1931, and eventually hired Abraham Wald in late 1932 as his private tutor. Karl Schlesinger participated in  ""Vienna Colloquium"" organized by Karl Menger in the 1930s, and it was reportedly Schlesinger who introduced economics to be considered by mathematicians there. Schlesinger's famous 1935 paper (presented March 19, 1934) proposed the complementary slackness conditions and inequalities for the Walras-Cassel system and provided the key to Abraham Wald's eventual solution of the existence of equilibrium problem. Schlesinger committed suicide in the Spring of 1938, the very day the Germany army set foot in Vienna.

Johann August Schlettwein, 1731–1802.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/schlettwein.htm," German Physiocrat. Johann August Schlettwein was born near Weimar and studied law and cameralistics at the University of Jena.  His early work was mostly unfocused, ranging from philosophy to theology. In 1763, Schlettwein moved to Karlsruhe and entered the service of Charles Frederick, Margrave of Baden. Both Schlettwein and Baden converted to Physiocracy not long after his arrival, although it is uncertain who influenced whom.  Nonetheless, Schlettwein proved to be the more zealous advocate, and would spend much of the rest of his life eagerly promoting Physiocratic schemes - although critics have often doubted Schlettwein's grasp of the theory beyond its superficial outlines and policy conclusions; Schumpeter compared him to a patent medicine salesman, ""the type of economist who will I fear never die out and who will forever discredit economics in the eyes of men whose approval is worth having"" (Schumpeter, 1954: 219) In 1770, Baden placed Schlettwein in charge of implementing experimental Physiocratic policies, including the single tax, in three Badisch villages - Dietlingen, Theningen and Balingen. In 1771, Schlettwein accompanied Baden to Paris to consult with the Physiocrats in person and wrote his first report on village experiments (pub. 1772). In response to critics, Schlettwein composed a long work, not quite addressing their points, but more just reiterating the principles of Physiocratic doctrine and policy (1773).

In 1773, Schlettwein broke with Baden and left for Vienna, hoping to procure an office in Austrian government. This went nowhere, and in 1776 he was invited by Isaak Iselin to Basel, where he carved out a living as a lecturer.  In 1777, Schlettwein moved to Hessen-Darmstadt to take up a chair in the new Oeconomie faculty at the university of Giessen. Finally stabilized, Schlettwein wrote his second major treatise, the Grundfeste (1779), partly as a reply to Dohm's critique and the basis for his Giessen lectures.  Schlettwein also launched a journal, the Archiv für den Menschen und Bürger in allen Verhältnissen, which ran from 1780 to 1784, recast as Neues Archiv from 1785 to 1788.

Schlettwein's activities and policy advocacy offended officials in Hessen-Darmstadt and in 1785, Schlettwein was pressured to resign his professorship at Giessen. He retired to his wife's small family estate in Mecklenburg, where he re-launched the journal as the Neues Archiv (1785-88). Private strife led to him to decamp by himself to Greifswald, lecturing at the local university from 1790.        Major Works of Johann August Schlettwein     Resources on J.A.

Gustav von Schmoller, 1838-1917.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/schmoller.htm,"  German economist at the University of Berlin, paramount leader of the Younger German Historical School Gustav von Schmoller was born in Heilbronn, then part of the Kingdom of Württemberg, the son of a military officer and administrator of royal estates.  While still young, Schmoller worked alongside his father in the Württemberg bureaucracy.  He studied cameralistics and law at the University of  Tübingen, obtaining his degree in 1861.  Following his family footsteps, Schmoller joined the Württemberg statistical bureau, although he was forced to resign two years later, apparently because of his pro-Prussian views.  Schmoller never submitted a separate Habilitation thesis; his gold-medaled doctoral thesis on the economic impact of the Reformation, plus his 100-page article digesting the statistics of the 1861 Zollverein census of Württemberg (1862) was considered enough to secure him an appointment as an assistant professor at the Prussian University of Halle in 1864.  The very next year, Schmoller was promoted to full professor of political science (Staatswissenschaft), taking the chair of the retiring Eiselen, who had taught Prussian administration, law and economics at Halle.  As he later reported, Schmoller was unfamiliar with Prussia, and delved into detailed historical research of it. He became particularly intrigued in the examination of the reforms of Friedrich Wilhelm I (the oft-ignored father of Frederick the Great). In 1872, Schmoller left Halle to occupy a newly-endowed chair at the University of Strasbourg, which had just been transformed from a French into a German university, after the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine in 1871.  It was there that Schmoller crossed paths with Georg F. Knapp. That same year (1872), at the instigation of Berlin professor Adolph Wagner, Schmoller organized the Eisenach conference on the ""Social Question"" (Sociale Frage) that led to the formation of the Verein für Sozialpolitik, (""Society for Social Policy""), a group of economists which supported a kind of corporatist state-industry-labor nexus. German liberals deplored the Verein's advocacy for state interventionism and came to label Schmoller and the Historicists as Kathedersozialisten (or ""Socialists of the Chair"") - a jestful appellation they never entirely lived down.  Schmoller's profile was raised in a polemical debate with Heinrich von Treitschke on the question of social reform (1874) In 1878, Schmoller launched the Staats- und Sozialwissenschaftliche Forschungen, a paper series of studies conducted by his own students. In 1881, Schmoller took over the editorship of the journal Jahrbuch für Gesetzgebung, Verwaltung und Volkswirtschaft im Deutschen Reich from Brentano and Hotzendorff  and thereafter the JfGVV would often be simply referred to as ""Schmollers Jahrbuch"".   In 1882, Gustav von Schmoller was appointed professor at the powerful University of Berlin, the flagship university of the new German Reich, succeeding to the chair of Adolf Held.  In 1884, Schmoller became a member of the Prussian Staatsrath, and in 1887 a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. German Historicism was resurrected under Gustav von Schmoller, who, from his throne at the University of Berlin, had a domineering influence in the German academic world in the latter quarter of the 19th Century. Schmoller's attacks on Classical and Neoclassical theory were more vociferous than his predecessors, such as Roscher, had dared essay -- almost rejecting theory as such, not merely its pretensions to universalism. As a result, Schmoller deplored the older Historicists' penchant for ""stages"" theories of history and their attempt to provide a ""positive"" as opposed to ""normative"" theory of economic history. Much of the work undertaken or commissioned by Schmoller was directed largely to microscopic analysis of political and economic history.  Schmoller would himself insist that he did not oppose theory , but merely that ""knowledge of facts"" preceded theory, and that the collection of facts was currently insufficient to inform and construct theory. Schmoller's opposition to Neoclassical economic theory entered him into a famous methodological debate (Methodenstreit) with Carl Menger in 1883-84.  Some argue that Schmoller lost the debate by the simple fact of non-engagement (it is reported that upon receiving Menger's Investigations, he returned it unread to its author and published a ""semi-review"" of it claiming that it had not even been worth reading).  Nonetheless, it is also alleged that Schmoller used his considerable influence on the German university appointment system to kept Classical and Neoclassical economic theory largely out of German teaching - earning him the eternal enmity of Menger's Austrian School in Vienna.  Schmoller's legacy in economics has been tainted by the fact that one of the most prominent recorders of the history of economic thought - Joseph Schumpeter - was himself an Austrian with little sympathy for the Historical School.   In the meantime, actual Socialists and Marxians regarded Schmoller's group (Adolph Wagner notwithstanding) as an instrument of government and businesses to control and mollify the working classes. This was virtually confirmed time and time again when the Verein would come up with patchy justifications for the industrial policies of Bismarck. The Verein rarely opposed an economic policy decision by the Imperial German government. A small anecdote from Pareto: At a conference in Geneva where Pareto was presenting a paper, Gustav von Schmoller was in the audience and kept noisily interrupting Pareto's talk by shouting ""There are no laws in economics!"" The next day, when Pareto spotted Schmoller in the streets of Geneva. Pareto approached Schmoller and hid his face, pretending to be a beggar (which was not too difficult since Pareto was a shabby dresser). ""Please, Sir,"" Pareto said, ""Can you tell me where I can find a restaurant where you can eat for nothing?"" Schmoller replied, ""My dear man, there are no such restaurants, but there is a place around the corner where you can have a good meal very cheaply."" ""Ah,"" said Pareto triumphantly, unveiling himself, ""so there are laws in economics!""     Schmoller's main works are his study on the weavers guild of Strasbourg (1879) which was followed up by further studies the guilds in 17th C. and 18th C. Brandenburg-Prussia.  His posthumous 1922 history of towns is also considered a classic.  Schmoller's most characteristic work is probably his 1898 Umrisse, a history of Prussian financial and trade policy, which clearly expresese his ideas about the process of formation of the national economy. Schmoller emphasized the vital importance of a powerful, centralizing Prussian state in breaking-up local particularlisms that were hindering economic development and social justice.  Schmoller regarded the authoritarian Prussian state as the only force capable of implementing social reforms beneficial to workers (e.g. 1918).  Schmoller's major work is arguably his Grundriss der allgemeinen Volkswirtschaftslehre (1900-04), although it is not as characteristic of his Historicist and polemical views as some of his smaller works.

Wilhelm von Schröder, 1640-1688.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/schroder.htm," Wilhelm von Schröder  (sometimes written as Schroeder, Schröter or Schrotter) was a Saxon Cameralist in Austrian service.  His father and namesake (often confused with his son in earlier writings) had been a state official of the tiny duchy of Saxe-Gotha, serving as its chancellor 1660-1663 (thus the immediate predecessor of Seckendorff in that position).  The young Wilhelm von Schröder was educated in the Gotha gymnasium, and began studying at the University of Jena.  He interrupted his studies c. 1660, to spend a few years touring Holland and England, thus gaining direct exposure to the budding scientific revolution and Anglo-Dutch Mercantilist thought.  An intimate of Boyle and Digby, the young Schröder was elected a member of the Royal Society perhaps as early as 1662. Schröder returned to Germany in 1663 to resume his studies at Jena.  His dissertation (1663) was a controversial (and rather Hobbesian) defense of absolutism, organized in three parts - identifying the good of the country with the good of the ruler, reducing laws, treaties and government policy to plain utility calculations, and denouncing the role of powerful ministers as encroachments on princely authority (this latter, third part, was later published separately).  Although approved by the rector of Jena, Schröder's dissertation caused a bit of a scandal.  It was suppressed by the State authorities and he was denied his degree.  We hear little about him again until 1673, when he converted to Catholicism and entered the Austrian civil service.  Commissioned to report on the state of manufacturing to Emperor Leopold I, Schröder drew much from his observations of England and English Mercantilist thought in his dispatches.  Around 1677,  Schröder was appointed to succeed the disgraced J.J. Becher as director of the Manufacturhaus, a textile workhouse in Tabor (Bohemia), and possibly also the Kunst- und Werkhaus, a model workshop in Vienna, although the latter would not survive the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683.  Schröder's principle Cameralist work was his Fürstliche Schatz- und Rent-Kammer (1686), to which was appended his earlier Notwendiger on money.  He did not deviate from his commitment to absolutism, although he noted that the wealth and the power of the ruler depended on the wealth and well-being of his subjects. Schröder advocated a scheme for the establishment of a central treasury, relying less on taxation and advocating instead the use of public loans and paper money.  Again drawing largely from English Mercantilism, Schroder's work is notable for its attack on guilds and emphasizing the centrality of expanded commerce and manufacturing as the key to national wealth.  He advocated the nurturing and protection of manufacturing from foreign competition (although he did not have a typical balance of trade doctrine, sensing it should be generally free, with a few exceptions).  Schröder's last years were spent as a finance councilor in the Pressburg (Hungarian) chamber. His posthumously-published Disquisitio (1713) was an unabashed defense of divine right and royal absolutism.

Shultz received his B.A. from City College, and went on to study at Columbia, under Henry L. Moore.  His studies were interrupted by the war and a sojourn in London.  Schultz only received his Ph.D. in 1926, by which time he was already an established scholar.  He joined the University of Chicago that same year (1926). Henry Schultz was a leading Walrasian in the United States, a pioneer in the introduction of quantitative methods into economics and one of the prominent members of the early Chicago School before his sudden death. Indeed, it was tragic disappearance that induced the University of Chicago to invite the Cowles Commission as a ""substitute"" for Schultz. Following Moore's lead, Schultz spent much of his short-lived career attempting to statistically estimate demand and supply functions for various products in all the multi-market complexity of Walras's general equilibrium system. His efforts are best captured in his two most famous studies (1928, 1938). His work on the application statistical methods to economic subjects laid much of the groundwork for later econometrics.  Shultz (1930) introduced ""cobweb theorem"" to explain commodity cycles.         Major works of Henry Schultz     Resources on Henry Schultz   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Although a student of Böhm-Bawerk and Wieser, Schumpeter was never really a footsoldier of the Austrian School, but cut his own swathe through economics. Joseph Alois Schumpeter was born in Triesch (Austrian Moravia), the only son of a cloth manufacturer. The Schumpeters were a long-established German Catholic family in a largely Czech town. After his father's early death in 1887, his mother moved to Graz, where Schumpeter received his elementary education.  In 1893, his mother re-married a military officer Sigismund von Keler and the family moved to Vienna.  His stepfather used his connections to secure Schumpeter's entrance into the prestigious Theresianum school as a day student. Right after finishing high school, Schumpeter enrolled at the law faculty of the University of Vienna in 1901.  Initially interested in history, Schumpeter was lured into economics by his teachers Eugen Philippovich, Friedrich von Wieser and Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk   Schumpeter obtained his doctorate in law in February 1906, at the relatively young age of 23, and had no clear idea what to do next.  Schumpeter spent a summer studying economics in Berlin, then decided to go abroad.  Schumpeter spent a year in England, loosely affiliated with the LSE, ostensibly undertaking research for a project on English common law.   But in fact, Schumpeter spent much of his time as a man about town enjoying the delights of London.  In 1907, Schumpeter married Gladys Ricarde Sever, the daughter of an Anglican dignitary, and soon after took a job with an Italian law firm in Cairo, Egypt. It was a well-paid position and Schumpeter relished the high life of the expatriate elite. He finish his first major work on economic methodology (1908) while in Cairo.  After two years in Egypt, encouraged by the reception of his book,  Schumpeter decided to return to Vienna and rejoin academia. Schumpeter submitted his habilitation thesis at Vienna and quickly obtained a job in March 1909 as assistant professor at the University of Czernowitz (east Galicia, now Ukraine) . It was while he was teaching at Czernowitz that Schumpeter wrote his Theory of Economic Development (1911), where he first outlined his famous theory of entrepreneurship. He argued those daring spirits, entrepreneurs, created technical and financial innovations in the face of competition and falling profits - and that it was these spurts of activity which generated (irregular) economic growth.   Bored of provincial Czernowitz, Schumpeter moved on to become full professor of economics at the University of Graz in 1911.  Still quite young, the position was secured with critical assistance from Böhm-Bawerk.  Graz was then dominated by German Historicists, and Böhm-Bawerk deployed Schumpeter in an effort to capture Graz for the Austrian school.  Despite being saddled with a heavy teaching load (all economics courses were foisted on him), Schumpeter found time to write a stream of books and articles during this stage. Nonetheless, Schumpeter found the environment at Graz to be hostile.   He jumped at the opportunity to spend a year (1913-14) at Columbia in the United States.  When World War I broke out in 1914, Schumpeter's wife refused to return to Austria, and went back to England on her own (they were eventually divorced by 1920). Schumpeter's wartime years were spent rather unproductively in Graz.   Schumpeter opposed the war, partly out of Anglophilia, but also partly because of patriotism - Schumpeter feared the war boded ill for the Hapsburg empire, and was merely serving to increase Germany's dominance over Austro-Hungary. After the war ended, in late 1918, Joseph Schumpeter surprisingly joined the German Socialization Committee in Berlin for Weimar Germany.  The invitation had been extended by old Austro-Marxist friends, Rudolf Hilferding and Emil Lederer, from his student days in Vienna, and Schumpeter accepted (as Schumpeter later quipped, ""if someone wants to commit suicide, it is a good thing if a doctor is present"").  After a few months of discussion, Schumpeter signed the majority report (written by the Marxists) rather than the minority report (of the liberals), agreeing that some kind of nationalization was necessary to make the German economy more efficient. Schumpeter left Berlin in March 1919 to take up the more alluring offer to serve as Minister of Finance in the new rump state of Austria.  The government consisted of a fractious coalition of all parties, only notionally under social-democrat chancellor  Karl Renner.  Schumpeter was invited not for political reasons, but as a technician to solve the country's economic mess.   Unfortunately, the situation in Austria was impossible to manage, and Schumpeter presided over a period of raging hyperinflation, and was dismissed later that year. After a brief return to teaching at Graz, Schumpeter decided to resign his professorship in 1921.  He migrated to the private sector and became the president of a small Viennese banking house. Ill-luck dogged him: his bank collapsed in 1924. He returned once again back into academia - taking up a teaching position at the University of Bonn (Germany) in 1925. In 1932, Schumpeter failed in his bid to get the retiring Sombart's chair at Berlin University (it went to Lederer instead). Sensing his political leanings were not welcome in Weimar Germany, Schumpeter left to take up a position at Harvard, succeeding the Marshallian F.W. Taussig.  He was joined by Alvin Hansen, Wassily Leontief, Richard Goodwin, Paul Sweezy, John Kenneth Galbraith and fellow Austrian, Gottfried Haberler. Schumpeter ruled Harvard during the period of the ""depression generation"" of the 1930s and 1940s - when Samuelson, Tobin, Tsuru, Heilbroner, Bergson, Metzler, etc. were his students. Although excelling as a teacher above everything, Joseph Schumpeter nonetheless wrote three more major books while at Harvard: his didactic Business Cycles (1939), his popular Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1942) - in which he famously predicted the downfall of capitalism in the hands of intellectuals - and his encyclopedic, History of Economic Analysis (1954, incomplete and published posthumously). In the first two, Schumpeter expanded upon his theory of entrepreneurship and theory of growth into a wider theory of the development of capitalism, integrating it into a business cycle theory and a theory socio-economic evolution. Schumpeter's legacy is difficult to assess. Although an enthusiast of Walras and the Lausanne School, Schumpeter contributed little to it beyond praise. Although his early methodological works had contributed to the Methodenstreit against the German Historicists, the other Austrians had long written him off as one of the faithful.  And his old Marxian comrades of Berlin and Vienna certainly did not regard this man with conservative instincts as a fellow traveler. Like Frank Knight, Schumpeter remains unclassifiable in our schema. Consequently, we give him the honor of founding ""evolutionary"" economics, given his concern with economic change brought about by the interaction between individuals and the economy as a whole, a concern with socio-economic history and institutions, but not enough to overshadow his search for an inherently theoretical explanation for the development of capitalism.

Anna J. Schwartz, 1915-2012,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/schwartz.htm," Monetarist economic historian.  Anna J. Schwartz is perhaps most famous for her monumental 1963 study A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960 with Milton Friedman. Like Friedman, Schwartz was educated at Columbia during its Institutionalist heydey under Wesley C. Mitchell.  She received her M.A. in 1936, and after a stint at the SSRC working on the history of British business cycles with A.A. Gayer and W.W. Rostow, Schwartz went on to join Mitchell's NBER as a researcher in 1941, where she remained for the rest of her career.  She only finally got around to receiving her Ph.D from Columbia in 1964.  Anna J. Schwartz began her collaboration on American business cycles with Milton Friedman in the 1950s, producing three major works (1963, 1970, 1982).  Friedman and Schwartz's work claimed to prove that business cycles were primarily driven by fluctuations in the money supply,  setting up the empirical groundwork for the Monetarist counter-revolution.  Although criticized for relying on an empiricist Institutionalist approach to the data, rather than deploying modern econometric theory, it was nonetheless one of the most influential empirical works in the 20th Century.

Tibor de Scitovsky, 1910-2002,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/scitovsky.htm," The Hungarian-born Tibor de Scitovsky is another prodigious product of Robbins's LSE, Scitovsky made his mark in welfare economics - but a mark of various hues.   Scitovsky is the author of the ""Community Indifference Curve"" (CIC) (1941, 1942) which is a remarkable analytical device that can be superimposed upon a production possibilities frontier and thus help one visualize the Paretian conditions for optimality.   However, in those same papers, he also unveiled what became known as the ""Scitovsky Reversal Paradox"". What he demonstrated was that if an allocation A is deemed superior to another allocation B by the Kaldor compensation criteria, by a subsequent set of moves by the same criteria, we can prove that B is also superior to A. The Scitovsky paradox threw much of welfare theory into confusion during the 1940s and 1950s. Like Abba Lerner, Tibor Scitovsky embraced the Keynesian Revolution from a welfare perspective.   His 1951 book integrated the analysis of ""power asymmetries"" in different markets with macroeconomics, basing a theory of inflation on this concept (also 1978).   He also ventured deeply into international trade theory, including the tariffs, economic integration, import-substitution policies, balance of payments problems and economic development (e.g. 1958, 1969, 1970).   Starting around 1960, Scitovsky returned to ""welfare"" theory, but now with a different tone. Welfare, Scitovsky argues, has been confused with ""consumption"" and consequently ""growth"", but human progress must be measured qualitatively as well as quantitatively.  Many societies, he claims, can attain better quality consumption with fewer resources while other, with numerous resources, only achieve lower quality consumption. Thus, argues Scitovsky, we should be careful when making welfare comparisons for quality matters.  Scitovsky has struggled over the years to give us a precise definition of ""quality"", but it has generally been related to ""joy"" in consumption. Certain types of consumption, he argues, are ""joyless"", others ""joyful"" and the difference between them is a composite of several things of which challenge, risk and a sense of accomplishment would be major factors. Scitovsky has extended his ideas into social critique: specialization has taken much of the joy out of work, he has argued, and consumption in American society (more than any other) has placed far too great a stress on comfort and safety in consumption and living, thereby depriving consumption activities of their challenging, risky and difficult elements, i.e. ""joy"". But given the innate ""need"" for such joyful, risky activities in human beings, thereby we can divine the cause of certain types of human behavior (e.g. gambling, dangerous sports, crime, etc.).  The ""cure"" for a joyless society, Scitovsky maintains, is to ""educate"" our consumption so as to infuse it with those joyful elements. Without such education, we are apt to surrender decisions on the quality of consumption to producers and these tend to aim for what is most amenable to mass production and comfort. While Scitovsky's arguments may seem daring, he stands in good company: Knight, Veblen, Keynes and Galbraith, are but a handful of the many other prominent economists who have stressed the need to think carefully about the ""qualitative"" aspects of economic progress..

George Poulett Scrope, 1787-1876,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/scrope.htm," Pioneering British geologist, landlord, politician and economist.  G. Poulett Scrope was an avid opponent of several tenets of the Ricardian school and a proponent of free banking and poor relief. He was born George Julius Thomson into an established merchant family, studied at Oxford and then Cambridge, where he first became interested in mineralogy and geology, and developed a special interest in volcanoes. He published two seminal works (1825, 1827) after extensive travels in Italy and France examining volcanic activity and formations. He changed his name after 1822, when he married Emma Phipps Scrope, heiress of William Scrope (pronounced ""Scroop"") of Castle Combe in Wiltshire.  George Poulett Scrope (as he now called himself) took up the public duties of a county squire as landlord, magistrate and deputy lord lieutenant of Wiltshire.   His practical concern with the rural poverty that confronted him daily drew him to political economy for answers.  But his delving into the writings of the Ricardian school left him very disappointed.   A Tory by social position and instinct, but Whig by allegiance, Scrope sought to formulate an alternative political economy, a middle way between the Ricardians' Whiggish faith in laissez faire markets and the ""organic paternalism"" of Tory reactionaries like Carlyle.   For this, Scrope drew on utilitarian rather than traditionalist arguments (his brother, Charles Syndeham, future governor-general of Canada, moved in Bentham's circle and infected him with that notion).  The end of political economy, he argued, was maximum happiness, not maximum wealth.  The latter can be a conduit to the former, but it is not an automatic assumption.  He gave a political-economic twist to the old concept of nobless oblige, the paternal duty of the rich towards the poor.  He argued that the ""compliance and loyalty"" of the poor is what made private property secure and thus the accumulation of capital possible to begin with.  Consequently  abandoning rural labor to the vicissitudes of the market was not only unjust from a utilitarian point of view, it would also lead to a brutalized and rebellious working class that would endanger England's prosperity.    Scrope delivered his views in 1831-32, in a series of pamphlets and articles for the Quarterly Review, a Tory rag.  These culminated in his main work, Principles of Political Economy (1833).   He was particularly disgusted by Ricardian embrace of the Malthusian ""iron law of wages"", which he felt unduly blamed the poor for their poverty and exonerated the rest of society from any responsibility for their plight.  Once Senior had condemned the doctrine, Scrope felt emboldened and, in 1831, launched his Quarterly Review attacks on ""that most pernicious dogma which has long been palmed upon the public as the fundamental axiom of political economy"" (1833: xvi). The Malthusian wage-fertility dynamics, whether as originally conceived of by Malthus, modified by Sadler and defended by Chalmers, were all wrong,   Empirically, Scrope argued, the means of subsistence grew faster than the natural population growth rate and the starving multiplied faster than the well-provided for.  He also ridiculed ""moral restraint"" as a distraction.  Confident that the growth of capital was for the betterment of all, Scrope also assailed the Ricardian doctrine of diminishing profits.   Diminishing returns, Scrope argued,  did not necessarily set in in agriculture.  If they set in, they were ""trifling"" and the benefits of industrial concentration and foreign sources would counterbalance them.  He did concede, however, that protection against foreign importation may exacerbate this. Scrope (1832, 1833) also delved into the Currency-Banking school debates of the 1830s, coming out against almost all the proposed restrictions.  Confident in the real bills doctrine, Scrope advocated a free banking system, with competitive, unrestricted note issue. If confidence was an issue, then let banks deposit government securities to back their note-issues, In 1832, fired up by the debate with the economists, George Poulett Scrope ran for parliament, contesting Stroud, in Gloucestershire, against a son of David Ricardo.  Scrope lost, but an inquiry into the electoral process forced Ricardo Jr. to resign.  Scrope ran again and won the seat in 1833, which he would retain it until 1868. Scrope entered parliament right after the reform bill had placed that institution largely in the hands of the bourgeoisie (true to his ""new"" social position, Scrope had not been very keen on extending the franchise).  He was immediately caught up in the debate to overhaul the Elizabethan Poor Laws. The Whigs wanted to do away with them altogether and throw the poor on the labor market.  Scrope rose to the defense of the Poor Laws.  Or rather, he proposed to reform them, not dismantle them.  In his view, the chief evil of their design was not that they encouraged idleness and dependence among the poor, but rather that it encouraged private businesses to drive wages to zero, counting on the parishes to make up for the difference. He thus denounced them as a hidden ""slavery"" in the countryside.  He agreed that ""wage subsidies"" should be abandoned, but insisted that poor relief remain in the hands of parish government and not private charity (""friendly societies""), as the Whigs had proposed.  The poor are still the state's obligation and the rates should be used to finance public works projects to give them employment.  Presciently, Scrope also outlined how a national insurance scheme, designed in the modern sense, could replace poor relief. When the Poor Law Reform Act was finally passed in 1834, Scrope was not so happy with the result.  He found the ""workhouses"" concept deplorable and condemned them accordingly.

Veit Ludwig von Seckendorff, 1626-1692.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/seckendorff.htm," Born into a Protestant Franconian noble family at the height of the Thirty Years' War, Veit Ludwig von Seckendorff was initially raised in Coburg and Erfurt. He became a protege of the Duke Ernest of Saxe-Gotha in his early teens, and attended the gymnasium at Gotha, before proceeding to study law at Strasbourg in 1642. His father, then fighting for the Protestant camp, was captured and executed that same year.  Around 1645, Duke Ernest appointed Seckendorff as  valet of his library, assigning him the task of summarizing the books for him.  Much of Seckendorff's vast learning was acquired in the course of this task. In 1652, Seckendorff was appointed as a high judicial councillor at the relatively young age of 27.  In 1655, he composed his principal work Teutsche Fürsten Staaten (""German Princely State""), a handbook of civil law and administration, often regarded as the founding treatise of German Cameralism. Seckendorff organizes his book in three parts, firstly, a detailed description of the country, its resources and its population, next a survey of government institutions, and finally, a discussion on the the best way to administer state property (i.e. the prince's demesne and monopolies) to secure the revenues for the prince.  Seckendorff identified the chief virtues of the prince as caring for the welfare of his subjects and the advice of his officials. Seckendorff stretched that paternalistic role to the wider economy, assigning the State responsibility for increasing population, education, control of usury, regulation of trade, upholding contract law and encouraging the right resource allocation.  In this manner, Seckendorff's handbook was the watershed between the old, narrow principles of royal household management and the newer, more expansive concerns of economic policy that would be taken up by later Cameralists. Seckendorff eventually ascended to the high office of chancellor of Saxe-Gotha in 1664, although he soon resigned that for the lighter duties in the government of Saxe-Altenburg.  His retirement after 1681 was spent exploring Christian pietism.  In 1692, Seckendorff was appointed the first rector of the newly-founded University of Halle, but did not live to see it take root.  But three decades later, Seckendorff's treatise was the textbook assigned in the first classes of economics by Simon Peter Gasser at Halle in 1727.

Edwin R.A. Seligman, 1861-1939.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/seligman.htm," American Institutionalist economist and public finance expert at Columbia. Born to a New York banking family of Jewish extraction, Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman was educated at Columbia, receiving his B.A. in 1879.  Like many of  ""new generation"" of US economists, E.R.A. Seligman undertook a sojourn for three years in Europe, studying at Heidelberg, Berlin, Paris and Genoa, where he came under the influence of the German Historical school. Seligman returned to the US in 1882 and obtained his Ph.D at Columbia in 1884, under Richmond Mayo-Smith.  Seligman was promptly appointed lecturer at Columbia from 1885, and raised to professor of political economy and finance at Columbia in 1891, where he would remain until his retirement.  Seligman was a founder and long-time editor of Columbia's house journal, the Political Science Quarterly (PSQ) in 1886. E.R.A. Seligman was an American convert to German Historicism.  Seligman's institutional and historical approach to public finance led him to become one of the foremost authorities on taxation in economics. He was a campaigner for the progressive income tax system and one of the primary researchers on the incidence of taxation.   Seligman was, together with his more radical comrade-in-methodology, Richard T. Ely, one of the founders of the American Economic Association (AEA) in 1885. While a historicist in method, and thus a founding father of  American Institutionalism, Seligman was nonetheless sympathetic to both Marxian and Austrian economics and he got on quite well with his Neoclassical colleague  John Bates Clark. Seligman and Clark would preside together over the rapid ascent of Columbia, making it arguably the leading social science department in the United States during the early 1900s. Seligman was also an excellent scholar of economic thought.  His 1902 Economic Interpretation of History was instrumental in introducing Karl Marx's economics to America academia.  Seligman's 1903 articles on ""Some Neglected British economists"" is largely responsible for digging the old British proto-marginalists out of obscurity. Seligman was also one of the founders and organizers of the early New School for Social Research, erected in protest against the attempts by the Columbia authorities to interfere in academic freedom.  After his retitrement, Seligman threw himself with Alvin S. Johnson in the editorship of the Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences.      Major works of Edwin R.A. Seligman     Resources on E.R.A.

Amartya K. Sen, 1933-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sen.htm," It may be a slight exaggeration to claim that ""Welfare Economics"" is but a synonym for Amartya Sen, but few economists have taken that field as far, as seriously and as profoundly as Sen. A perennial Nobel Prize candidate (he has been winning straw polls among economists for several years running - and finally won the Nobel in 1998), Sen is one of the few modern academics that has commanded much respect and recognition from all corners of the intellectual spectrum. Born in Dhaka (then British Bengal), Amartya K. Sen studied at Presidency College, Calcutta, and subsequently Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a student of Joan Robinson, receiving his Ph.D. in 1959.  Sen taught at Delhi University in India from 1963, but eventually returned to Britain in 1971, to join the faculty at LSE.  In 1977 he moved up to Oxford, becoming Drummond Professor in 1980.  In 1988, Sen moved to the United States to take a position as professor of economics and philosophy at Harvard.  He returned to the UK in 1998, as master of Trinity College, Cambridge.  Sen returned to Harvard in 2004. Amartya Sen quickly transcended his Cambridge School roots to simultaneously embrace social choice theory and economic development - breaking the barrier between mathematized ""high theory"" and ""real-world"" economics.  It was a logical marriage for Sen: the peasants and rural households which he studied have economic modes of behavior which often contradict the postulates of the ""rational hedonist"" that dominate economic theory. In particular, certain collective enterprises (e.g. during harvest season) often contradict individual rationality. In this line, Sen exploited game-theoretic notions to account for such collective behavior.   Nonetheless, the problem Sen identified through his research is the common assumption in welfare economics of incomparable interpersonal utilities. His famous 1970 treatise, Collective Choice and Social Welfare, finds that this is indeed the keystone in the famous ""Arrow Impossibility Theorem"". Without it, Sen argued, the theorem can fall; with it, the theorem is vacuous. In another famous work (1970), Sen turned his methodological sights on the the Pareto-Optimality criteria - arguing that the assumption of Pareto-optimality in welfare theory was not value-neutral but rather contradicted the old J.S. Mill notion of ""liberalism"" as the Paretian criteria has no safeguards for ""personal space"". Sen was no detached thinker, however. In 1972, Sen co-authored a famous UN guideline for development project evaluation which has proven invaluable for many organizations. His work on poverty, which has included innumerable theoretical insights, has also proved fruitful in application.    Sen's celebrated 1981 study on famines, drawing on his research as well as his personal experience of the 1943 Bengal famine, put the blame squarely on distribution rather than food shortages.  Sen continued to work on a variety of issues related to poverty, becoming one of the foremost scholars of the bottom quintiles of the population. Sen's approach to development theory has emphasized the importance of political institutions, inequality, education and health as critical factors that need to be addressed not only in combination with economic development policy, but as a prelude and necessary conditions for their success. Amartya K. Sen combined his work on philosophy and poverty in his Development and Freedom (1998). Sen proposes a new ""capability approach"" to understand the concept of individual and social welfare, going beyond the simplistic utilitaranism of conventional theory, to consider what people are actually capable of doing and achieving,  thus providing a basis for a more subtle and useful understanding of equality and justice.

Nassau William Senior, 1790-1864.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/senior.htm," English economist of the Oxford School. A descendant of Sephardic Jewish emigrants to 17th C. London (from Portugal or Spain, via Hamburg), some of whom had gone on to live in Barbados and Jamaica, may help explain the unusual first and last name this great English economist. The first holder of the Drummond Chair at Oxford, Nassau William Senior was a detractor from orthodox Ricardianism.  Nassau William Senior. along with his former tutor and friend Richard Whately, formed the core of the the ""Oxford-Dublin"" tradition of proto-marginalist economics, and is an important predecessor of the Marginalist Revolution.   John Stuart Mill took much effort to respond to Senior.   Senior also developed an ""abstinence"" theory of capital and interest (in his main 1836 treatise). An important opponent of Malthus's population doctrines, Senior was also one of the developers of the ill-fated ""wages fund"" doctrine.   His methodological essays on the scope of political economy - his insistence on the deductive method and his arguments for the distinction between wealth and welfare - are also well-known.  A proponent of laissez-faire, Senior was a active participant in Whig politics, being one of the commissioners responsible for the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834.   Senior was famously opposed to trade unions and against reductions in working hours (arguing that for enterprise, ""the whole net profit is derived from the last hour."").

Antonio Serra, ?-? (fl.1613),https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/serra.htm,"The Neapolitan writer Antonio Serra was an obscure late 16th-17th C. century philosopher and progenitor of mature Mercantilism.  Antonio Serra is often hailed as ""the first economist"". Practically nothing is known about Antonio Serra himself - neither his vital statistics, his profession, his origins nor his fate.  All we know is gleaned from his one and only published tract.  From this, we can deduce that Antonio Serra was a native of Cosenza (in Calabria, part of the Kingdom of Naples), probably had a good Jesuit education, a doctor degree and some familiarity with business, that he was accused of participating in the 1599 conspiracy of the philosopher Tommaso Campanella against the Spanish government of Naples, and wound up in the Vicaria prison in Naples for many years.  Serra was in prison when he wrote his masterpiece, the Breve Trattato (1613), dedicated to the Spanish vice-roy of Naples, Fernando Ruiz de Castro, Count of Lemos.  It was published in 1613 by the printer Lazzaro Scorriggio in Naples, in an evidently small printing run.  Serra's work remained virtually unknown until nearly a century-and-half later, when it was rediscovered and popularized by Ferdinando Galiani. (Galiani, 1750, p.409)    In the Breve Tratatto, Antonio Serra addresses the economic condition of the Kingdom of Naples, in particular the causes of the shortage of coin and the policies to address it.  Serra's tract is written as an antidote to Marc' Antonio di Santis, a contemporary pamphleteer, who had been promoting Bullionist"" theories and policies (prohibiting the export of bullion, regulation of exchange, etc.), which Serra regarded as obsolete and wrong-headed. In the first part of the treatise, Serra explains the causes of the wealth of nations. He notes that certain factors - like the abundance of natural resources, fertility of land and geographical location - are accidents of Divine Providence.  But he identifies four factors critical for prosperity that are not accidental and can be modified - the industrial manufacturing capacity, the skill of the population, the extent of trade, and the wisdom of the government.  So while Naples may be blessed with accidental causes, it is much poorer than competitors like Venice due to these other four factors.  In the second part, Serra considers Di Santis's proposals in more detail. Di Santis believes precious metal had been flowing from Naples to Venice due to the excessively high exchange rate in Naples relative to other financial centers, that, as a result, foreign traders used bills of exchange to make payments to Neapolitans, but demanded coin for payments abroad.  If Naples lowered its exchange rate, Di Santis argued, then it could reverse the situation and lead to an inflow of precious metal.  Serra denounced these ideas as obsolete and wrong-headed.  The flow of precious metal, Serra noted, is due to the balance of trade, and had little to do with the mechanics of how individual traders got paid.   Presciently, Serra includes ""invisible"" elements, notably profit and interest payments abroad, as part of his balance of trade.   He notes that Naples may have a positive trade balance in its exports of agricultural goods, but this was outweighed by the flow of payments to foreigners in the form of interest on Neapolitan public debt and profits from foreign-owned enterprises inside the Neapolitan kingdom.  While Serra is sometimes credited as the first to articulate the balance of payments, it is a bit of an overstatement.  He did not make his calculations for the whole accounts of Naples, but just for specific sectors. In the third part of his treatise, Serra treats economic policy head-on, reviewing the efficacy of various exchange controls, debasement and other policies that have been pursued.  Although not necessarily averse to Bullionist-type administrative restrictions in principle, he sees them as largely ineffectual, and that they only touch the surface of the problem, and do not deal with the underlying real problem of an unfavorable balance of trade.  The main focus of policy, Serra insists, should be in improving the four critical factors - in particular manufacturing.  Serra was arguably the first economist to posit that there are increasing returns (diminishing costs) to the scale of manufacturing and diminishing returns (increasing costs) to the expansion of agriculture. He believes the promotion of of the production and export of high-value manufactured goods will be the key to improving the terms of trade and reversing the outflow of money. Serra was thus one of the first to analyze and fully understand  fully understand the concept of balance of trade for both visible goods and invisible services and capital movements. He explained how the shortage of coin in the Kingdom of Naples was due to balance of payments deficit. Using his findings he was able to reject the popular idea at the time that the scarcity in money was due to the exchange rate. The solution to the problem was found in the active encouragement of exports. While an exception performance for the time, Antonio Serra's work has been perhaps over-hailed with superlatives.  Ferdinand Galiani crowned him the ""earliest and most ancient writer on the science of political economy"" (1750: p.410), which others have frequently re-iterated, e.g. the count Pietro Custodi calls him ""the first writer of political economy"" (1803: p.xxvii).  Travers Twiss called him the ""founder of economical science"" (Twiss, 1847: p.8).  Even Schumpeter would write that ""this man must, I think, be credited with having been the first to compose a scientific treatise, though an unsystematic one, on economic principles and policy"" (1954: p.195) and that there was anything unlike it for decades, until the appearance of the mature Mercantilist. literature in England in the latter half of the 17th Century  However, these garlands should be moderated by remembering Serra's treatise did not, in fact, have any perceptible impact on contemporaries, not even inside Naples.  Serra remained largely unknown until Galiani re-discovered him in 1750, and made use of it in his 1770 Dialogues.  Galiani believed he had the only extant copy in existence (more have been discovered since the late 19th Century - there are, at last count, ten surviving copies of Serra's original treatise).  The solitary copy seen by Galiani was originally held by the Neapolitan official Bartolomeo Intieri, and later passed successively through the hands of Antonio Genovesi, Giuseppe Palmieri (Marchese de Martignano) and Francesco Salfi, before baron Pietro Custodi received it, and published a copy in his Scrittori classici italiani collection of 1803, finally making Serra's treatise available to the general public.  Significantly, violating chronological order, Custodi placed Serra as the first tract of the collection (leapfrogging over earlier Italian writers like Davanzati and Scaruffi).

Ernest Seyd, 1833-1881,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/seyd.htm,"Influential German-born Anglo-American banker and monetary economist.  Born in Prussia, Ernest Seyd emigrated to the United States at a young age.  He later moved back to Europe.  He was in Paris during the events of 1848, and seems to have participated in the German revolution and Frankfurt parliament.  In 1857, he moved permanently to Britain, where he became an advisor to the Bank of England and participated in the monetary and banking debates of the time.  He continued to provide extensive commentary on monetary and banking reform in other countries, and is especially credited for the German Banking Act of 1875. Ernest Seyd's name got implicated in a scandal in his later years, after his death, by American agitators for bimetallism.  If the accusers are to be believed, Seyd was dispatched by the Bank of England to the United States in the winter of 1872-73, with the purpose of persuading the US Congress to pass a bill demonetizing silver.  Seyd was accused of having with hims some half-million dollars raised by English and German bankers (Rothschild esp.), which he freely distributed in  bribes to several US Congressmen and Senators to secure the passage of the bill.  The complication, of course, is not only that Seyd was in London throughout this time, but that he was an vocal and ardent bimetallist - indeed, one of the few leading monetary figures in that camp.  Nonetheless, American bimetallist agitators and pamphleteers during the 1890s, keen to portray the gold standard as a foreign plot, dragged Seyd's name through the mud. He should not be confused with his son and namesake, Ernest Seyd, Jr., author of several books on the silver question (1886, 1893).

George L.S. Shackle, 1903-1992.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/shackle.htm," Although born in Cambridge, George Lennox Sharman Shackle obtained his Ph.D. from the L.S.E. in 1937, at the height of the early Robbins years.  Shackle was a professor of economics at the University of Liverpool for most of his life. A pioneering Post Keynesian, G.L.S. Shackle was among the first economists to insist on the importance of ""real"" uncertainty and time for economic theory. This was an outcome of his early work in investment and business cycle theory (for which see his now famous 1938 dissertation, Expectations, Investment and Income). His work on uncertainty focused on moving away from probability- based resultions for uncertain situations and moving towards more complex modes of behavior which include ""potential surprise"", ""focus-outcome"" of competing choices, much of it linked to uncertainty-induced demand failures. Much of his theory was set out in the breakthrough work, Expectation in Economics (1949). His reflections on the concept of ""time"" in economics and how that is related to uncertainty and decision-making was a life-long concern of Shackle. His work Time in Economics (1958), Decision, Order and Time in Human Affairs (1961) and A Scheme of Economic Theory (1965) provide exemplary results of this. Two of his works on doctrinal economic history have become classics: his Years of High Theory detailing the economic debates surrounding the Keynesian Revolution in Britain are invaluable as is his Epistemtics and Economics, an incisive critical evaluation of various economic theories.

"Anthony Ashley Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury", 1671-1713,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/shaftesbury.htm," 17th C. English aristocrat and hedonic philosopher, progenitor of the Scottish school of moral sense. Anthony Ashley Cooper (third Earl of Shaftesbury) was the grandson of the formidable namesake Anthony Ashley Cooper (first Earl of Shaftesbury), the famous chancellor of England under King Charles II and later leader of the opposition to the future King James II.  The young Shaftesbury was raised in his grandfather's house and educated by private tutors under the directions of the philosopher John Locke.  After the Glorious Revolution of 1688 had rehabilitated his family, the young Shaftesbury went into public life.  In 1694, he was elected to the House of Commons, serving the Whig party of King William III.  However, finding Parliamentary life a bit trying for his shy character and sickly disposition, he served only one term and then fled to the safe anonymity of Holland. In 1699, with the death of his father, the young nobleman returned to England and (reluctantly) took up his official duties as the third Earl of Shaftesbury.  But with the ascension of Queen Anne and the rise of the Tories in 1702, Shaftesbury found himself on the wrong side of the political fence and withdrew into retirement on his estates. Shaftesbury's claim to fame rests on his youthful Inquiry concerning Virtue and Merit (1699, published by John Toland without Shaftesbury's permission).  This treatise, much influenced by Locke, laid down an alternative theory of moral sense, in opposition to the egoistic theories of Thomas Hobbes.   Shaftesbury's ethical philosophy is articulated once more in the form of a fictitious dialogue in the Moralists (1709).   Hobbes had abandoned the rational, religious and dutiful theories of ethics to reduce morality essentially to the egoistic hedonistic passions of man.   Altruistic or benevolent acts, Hobbes asserted, are always rooted in some  form of self-interested behavior - the desire for reward, praise, etc.  Shaftesbury attempted to subvert the crass implications of Hobbes's theory, not by returning to older theological arguments, but rather by insisting that benevolence too is a passion in its own right.  Repeatedly comparing morality to art, virtue with beauty, Shaftesbury proposes the existence of a natural, innate 'moral sense', just as there is an innate aesthetic taste,  'a first principle in our constitution and make',  characterized  (but not solely) by benevolent affections. (Shaftesbury speaks of reason 'controlling' passions, but does not seem to make much use of it in his theory.)  He used examples of parental affection, zeal for posterity, mirth in social contexts, etc. as evidence that public affections were natural, and not reducible to self-interest.  Shaftesbury's theory is rather simple, and sometimes mocked as shallow and wishful.  Bernard de Mandeville called Shaftesbury's notions ""a High Compliment to Mankind"", but ""What pity it is that they are not true!"" (Mandeville, 1723).  Nonetheless, identification of a 'moral sense', independent of religious teachings, and his attempt to combine it, or at least make it not inconsistent with, hedonics was highly influential on the Scottish Enlightenment, particularly Frances Hutcheson, David Hume and, through them, Adam Smith. Shaftesbury's writings on religious enthusiasm (1708, 1709) advocated the use of ridicule, rather than the heavy hand of censorship or test acts, to deal with false or dangerous opinions. In 1711, he collected his essays for publication as Characteristics, including as its third volume, Miscellaneous Reflections, further thoughts and clarifications of his earlier writings, as well as a rambling set of speculations on all manner of subjects (including a defence of 'free thinking' in religion, that would provoke Berkeley's Alciphron).   In 1711, pressured by illness, Shaftesbury traveled to France and Italy, looking for a health sanctuary to recuperate.  In Italy, he wrote his essay on aesthetics (Hercules), posthumously published in later editions of the Characteristics. He died shortly after in Naples, at the premature age of 42.

George Bernard Shaw, 1856-1950,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/shaw.htm," Famous Irish playwright, novelist and one of the leading Fabian socialists, who hoped to marry Marxian socialism with Neoclassical value theory.   Soon after joining the Fabian Society in 1884, George Bernard Shaw came across an article by Philip H. Wicksteed criticizing Karl Marx's theory of value from the marginalist viewpoint.  Although hardly versed in economic theory, Shaw bravely took it upon himself to reply to Wicksteed.  But his reply was feeble, as Shaw himself was not fully convinced of Marx's labor theory of value.   Wicksteed's good-hearted rejoinder to Shaw stoked up a friendship between the two men.  Shaw joined Wicksteed's ""Economic Circle"", a Hampstead debating society. Congenitally incapable of understanding mathematics, Shaw set himself down to understand the economics of Jevons under the private tutelage of Wicksteed.  As Shaw himself recalls, he put himself ""into Mr. Wicksteed's hands and became a convinced Jevonian, fascinated by the subtlety of Jevons' theory and the exquisiteness with which it adapted itself to all the cases which had driven previous economists, including Marx, to take refuge in clumsy distinctions between use value, exchange value, labour value, supply and demand value, and the rest of the muddlements of that time.""   The truth about value, Shaw gradually concluded, was with the marginalists -- but that should in no way implicate the remainder of Marx's contributions.  Shaw had hoped to marry Marxian and Neoclassical economists, e.g. arguing that it was the purchaser, not the capitalist, who ultimately robbed the surplus value from labor.   In 1886, Shaw launched a campaign to divest Marxism from the labor theory of value.  He took aim at British Marxists, such as H.M. Hyndman, who remained obstinately attached to Marx's theory of value and urged them to adopt Jevonian theory.  He gathered his articles on the topic in his Fabian Essays (1889). Shaw's campaign did not succeed.  The chapter-and-verse Marxists just became more irritated.  His fellow Fabians, while sharing his dissatisfaction with the labor theory of value, were not quite prepared to fully embrace marginalist economics in its stead.  Nonetheless, by weaning the Fabians off value theory, Shaw insulated their brand of Marxian socialism from being bogged down in scholastic debates on ""what Marx really meant"" and to concentrate on their more practical program of building socialism in Britain. Although he is often referred today as an Irish nationalist, Shaw's attitude to the British Empire was actually much more ambivalent. Shaw prodded the Fabians to adopt a pro-imperial stance and support imperialistic adventures, such as the Boer War.  His argument was simple: as socialist reform is best conducted ""from above"", then the spread of socialism throughout the world is best achieved by bringing the peoples of the world under a single ""enlightened"" government, rather than hoping that a myriad of independent nationalist movements will gradually adopt socialist sensitivities.

Sidney Sherwood, 1860-1901,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sherwood.htm," Early American Neoclassical economist at the Johns Hopkins University. Sidney Sherwood originated from Ballston, near Saratoga, New York. He received his BA at Princeton in 1879.  After a year teaching at Newton Collegiate Institute in New Jersey, Sherwood went abroad for two years.  Returning in 1883, Sherwood studied law at  Columbia.in 1884-85, initially out of mere intellectual curiosity.  Sherwood ended up passing the New York State bar and went on to practice for three years in a New York law firm. Sherwood eventually decided to return to academia and pursue his growing interest in economics.  Sherwood enrolled at the Johns Hopkins University in 1888, obtaining his Ph.D. in 1891.  He was promptly appointed an instructor in finance at the University of Pennsylvania. Although a student of the historicist Richard T. Ely while at Hopkins, Sidney Sherwood was one of the earliest American converts to the Marginalist Revolution and thus much favored by Ely's nemesis, Simon Newcomb.  After Ely's abrupt departure from Hopkins in 1892, the young Sidney Sherwood was immediately ""called back"" to Hopkins from Pennsylvania after serving there only a year. Sherwood was promptly appointed the head of the political economy program at the Johns Hopkins University.  Sherwood was largely responsible for the subsequent ""Neoclassicization"" of that department. Although relatively little known to modern economists, Sidney Sherwood ought to be noted for his contributions to the ""credit theory"" of money.  He died an untimely death in 1901, while still in his early forties.  He was replaced by Jacob H. Hollander.

Gerald F. Shove, 1887-1947.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/shove.htm," Cambridge economist, best known as a tireless teacher and supervisor of undergraduates.  Gerald Frank Shove was educated at Uppingham, and enrolled at King's College, Cambridge, in 1907, where he came under the tutelage of John Maynard Keynes, graduating in 1911.  Recruited into the ""Apostles"" in 1909, Shove became a close friend of Keynes, and was one of the few Cambridge colleagues who overlapped into Keynes's private world with the Bloomsbury group in London.  Shove was also involved with the Fabians and the Liberal Party.  A lifelong pacifist, Shove obtained exemption as conscientious objector during WWI. Shove put out a pacifist paper, Face the Facts during the war.  Shove would later organize the New Peace Movement during the 1930s. Despite Keynes's sponsorship, Gerald Shove failed to obtain a fellowship at Cambridge in 1914 with a dissertation on G.E. Moore's philosophy.  Nonetheless, Shove was appointed lecturer in economics in 1923,  and through the next couple of decades took over much of Keynes's lecturing responsibilities, relieving the busy man to carry on his busy work.  Shove was finally elected fellow of King's College, Cambridge in 1926.  He went on to serve as Provost (head) of King's College after 1933.  Never comfortable with writing, and weighed down by classes and administrative duties, Shove published very little.  Shove's rare ventures into print were mostly in defense of Marshallian orthodoxy against the theoretical assaults of Sraffa, Robinson and Keynes.

Henry Sidgwick, 1838-1900.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sidgwick.htm," English utilitarian philosopher and Classical economist at Cambridge University. Henry Sidgwick was born in the year after Queen Victoria took the throne, and died six months before she died.  It was a fateful coincidence; in many ways,  Henry Sidgwick was the quintessential Victorian, the perfect 19th Century English academic. Educated at Rugby, Sidgwick entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1855.   Graduating in Classics and Mathematics in 1859, laden with prizes, Sidgwick was immediately elected Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.  He was to remain a teacher at Trinity College until his death. (although he temporarily lost his fellowship in 1869 over his refusal to make a religious oath; he was re-elected in 1885).  Throughout the 1860s, he would undertake the study of philosophy, religious history and ethics.  The outcome of his efforts was his famous Methods of Ethics (1874).  Sidgwick was particularly influenced by the thought of John Stuart Mill.  In this famous book, he attempted to reconcile Mill's utilitarian philosophy with the ""intuitional"" (i.e. ""duty"") theory of ethics.  However, he recognized that one could not, a priori, reconcile either of these with the principle of self-interest.  Sidgwick also proposed that the appropriate measure of social welfare was average utility multiplied by the size of the population.   This solution was much applauded by Edgeworth (1877). As a lecturer on Moral Sciences, economics fell partly under his purview, and here too, Sidgwick was also a follower of of John Stuart Mill.  Sidgwick was a proponent of the Classical School of political economy just at the time when it was coming under its greatest assaults.  Sidgwick fended off the critiques of the English Historicists,  Sidgwick was also aware of the deficiencies of Wages Fund doctrine, but believed it could be salvaged with a little tweaking and flexibility.  However, he never really grasped the significance of the Marginalist Revolution of 1871.  He was prepared to accept Jevons's theory of marginal utility as ""in the main true and as an important addition to the older theory, but I am not prepared to say that the modification thus introduced into the theory of value...is enough to make me regard Jevons's doctrine as a new basis."" (Letter to Foxwell, November 1886).   In his Principles (1883), Sidgwick was particularly keen on defending Mill  from Jevons's assault (but not Ricardo, whom Sidgwick painstakingly distinguished from Mill).  Sidgwick's textbook was attacked in reviews not only for being a relic of Classicism, but also for being all dry, abstract theory, with not enough application or policy.  Nonetheless,  Sidgwick was one of the first economists to recognize externalities as a source of market failure. Henry Sidgwick was appointed Knightsbridge Professor of Moral Sciences at Cambridge in 1883. When Alfred Marshall was appointed as Professor of Political Economy in 1885 (succeeding Fawcett), Sidgwick initially tried to exercise his seniority on the Moral Sciences board to interfere in Marshall's economics curriculum, something Marshall vigorously resisted.  Sidgwick, in turn, resisted Marshall's attempts to aggrandize the space for economics in the Moral Sciences Tripos.  However fraught on paper, the personal relationship between Sidgwick and Marshall was nonetheless cordial and convivial, and sometimes characterized as a deep friendship.  Sidgwick gradually abdicated his attempts to control economics, and gave Marshall the leeway to construct his Neoclassical school at Cambridge. Sidgwick relished Cambridge and frequently participated in the university's administrative matters. He was a member of the ""Apostles""  the exclusive Cambridge discussion group and the Grote Club. Like his hero Mill, Sidgwick was a promoter of women's education (if not quite outright equality).  In 1871, he established a residence for women students at Cambridge, which, in 1879, finally became Newnham College in 1880.  In 1876, Sidgwick married, Eleanor Mildred Balfour, the sister of Arthur J. Balfour, the future British Prime Minister (and ex-Sidgwick student). Eleanor herself became the second principal of Newnham.  Interestingly, Mary Paley, Marshall's future wife, was one of the college's first students.  Sidgwick's own sister was married to the Archbishop of Canterbury.   A final quirk: always a bit mystically-inclined, Sidgwick was one of the founders and first president (1882-85, 1888-93) of the Society for Psychical Research and a member of Metaphysical Society.

Herbert A. Simon, 1916-2001,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/simon.htm," Pioneer of behavioral economics. There are many that claim that Herbert A. Simon has precipitated something like a revolution in microeconomics. This revolution is in the concept of ""decision-making"" in organization and under uncertainty, which he claims is far away from the ""rational man"" often assumed in mainstream microeconomics. He is certainly not the first one to come up with this critique, but he is by far the best known in this regard - and won a Nobel Memorial prize for it in 1978. Herbert Alexander Simon was trained at the University of Chicago, obtaining his BA in 1936 and a Ph.D. in political science in 1943.  From 1949, Simon was a professor of administration and psychology and eventually also computer science at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie-Mellon).  Simon actually started his economic life at the Cowles Commission and some of his first few contributions were in that vein. Of notable importance was his 1949 article unveiling the ""Hawkins-Simon"" conditions for non- negative square matrices. Simon subsequently began working on industrial organization and, among the various things he found, already announced in his early 1947 work, was that both the internal organization of firms and the external business decisions of firms seems to conform poorly with the Neoclassical theories of ""rational"" decision-making. In an avalanche of articles and books since the 1950s, Simon has focused much of his attention on the issue of decision-making - and has come up with a behavioral theory based on ""bounded rationality"". Agents, he claim, face uncertainty about the future and costs in acquiring information in the present. These two factors, thus, limit the extent to which agents can make a fully rational decision. Thus, Simon claims, they have only ""bounded rationality"" and are forced to make decisions not by ""maximization"" by ""satisficing"", i.e. setting an aspiration level which, if achieved, they will be happy enough with, and if they don't, try to change either their aspiration level or their decision. These ""rules of thumb"" are the utmost agents can achieve in the ""bounded"" and uncertain real world. Simon has backed up much of his work with numerous studies on decision-making in business enterprise. Out of this, the ""new"" theory of the firm as a ""satisficing"" as opposed to ""maximizing"" agent has begun to take hold in industrial organization. In general, Simon's theories of bounded rationality have become an integral part of the so-called ""New Institutionalist Economics"".   Herbert Simon went beyond economics to psychology and computer science, in pursuit of his grand goal of understanding not only human decision-making in organizations, but the nature of thinking itself.  In Simon's view, the human mind is ""wonderful, but not incomprehensible"", and thoughtful decisions - rational, bounded, intuitive and/or creative - can be modeled.  For his efforts in computer science and artificial intelligence, Simon received the Turing Award in 1975 along with his frequent co-writer Allen Newell.      Major Works of Herbert A.

Henry C. Simons, 1899-1946.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hcsimons.htm," A student of Frank H. Knight, Henry C. Simons represents, to many, the early days of ""Monetarism"" at Chicago - and thus the true progenitor of what is commonly considered the Chicago School.  Unlike Knight, Simons had no qualms about the desirability of a capitalist free-market system and was outspoken in his defense (and recommendation) of laissez-faire as policy. An avid opponent of New Deal policies, his pleas for their reversal in both the popular press and the journals of the University of Chicago, were compounded with a call for the government to instead merely set the framework for the working of a free market economy and to then withdraw. He did recommend the government pursue Anti-Trust policy vigorously - against both firms and labor unions - as well as setting out the now famous Monetarist creed of strict control and provision of a stable supply of money according to a non-discretionary (albeit counter-cyclical) ""rule"" -- what was known as the ""Chicago Plan"". Thus, he called during that time for active monetary expansion via deficit spending. Other than this, Simons contributed little to economics other than setting out some proposals on tax reform, many of which have since been implemented. Henry Simons's role was perhaps more as a teacher of the generation that was to stress more on the distinctive character of the ""Chicago School"", particularly his appointment to the Chicago Law School was to become characteristic of the later law-economic nexus of Chicago. Naturally, Simons was acknowledged by Milton Friedman as one main teachers and influences.      Major works of Henry C. Simons     Resources on H.C. Simons   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Sir John Sinclair, 1754-1835,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sinclair.htm,"Scottish statesmen, statistician and agrarian reformer. Scion of the Sinclairs of Ulster, a noble family of Caithness, John Sinclair was tutored by the poet John Logan before enrolling in the high school and then the university of Edinburgh at the age of thirteen.   He spent a year in Glasgow, studying law under John Millar, before returning to Edinburgh to complete his studies.  By this time (1770), he had inherited his father's estates, and actively taken up their management. In 1774, having passed the bar, he entered Lincoln's Inn.  In 1775, he enrolled in Trinity College, Oxford, and was made a member of the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh.  But law bored him and he soon entered political life.  In 1780, he won the Parliamentary seat for Caithness and joined the Tory faction of Lord North.  Sinclair was an early proponent of parliamentary reform, authoring several tracts on the matter, notably the anonymous Lucubrations in 1782. After the death of his first wife in 1785, Sinclair headed for the continent.  He spent time with Jacques Necker in Paris, before proceeding on an extensive tour of  northern Europe, going as far as Moscow.  Upon his return in 1787, Sinclair set about managing and implementing improvements on his Scottish estates. Sinclair had gotten particularly engaged in the improvement of sheep-breeding and wool production, wrote several tracts on the matter and in 1791 founded an society in Edinburgh for the purpose.  Along the way, Sinclair received a baronetcy from Pitt the Younger in 1786 and a doctorate in law from the University of Glasgow in 1788. Perhaps heeding Steuart (1767), or just spurred by the general spirit of Scottish Enlightenment, Sinclair conceived a plan to conduct an extensive empirical survey of Scotland.  In 1791, Sinclair prevailed on the General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland to provide the means and information to compile his massive, twenty-one volume Statistical Account of Scotland.  This was the first time the term ""statistics"" was used in English.  It was an anglicized form of the German word ""statistik"" (forged originally by Gottingen professor Gottfried Achenwall in 1749, to denote the ""science of the State"").  Sinclair alerted that his own use of the term went beyond its narrow State-centric political definition: ""Many people were at first surprised, at my using the new words, Statistics and Statistical, as it was supposed, that some term in our own language, might have expressed the same meaning. But, in the course of a very extensive tour, through the northern parts of Europe, which I happened to take in 1786, I found that in Germany they were engaged in a species of political inquiry, to which they had given the name Statistics; and though I apply a different idea to that word, for by Statistical is meant in Germany, an inquiry for the purpose of ascertaining the political strength of a country, or questions respecting matters of state; whereas, the idea I annex to the term, is an inquiry into the state of a country,  for the purpose of ascertaining the quantum of happiness enjoyed by its inhabitants, and the means of its future improvement ; yet, as I thought that a new word, might attract more public attention, I resolved on adopting it, and I hope that it is now completely naturalized and incorporated within our language."" (Sinclair, 1798, Vol. 20: p.xiii-xiv)).  [Note: Strictly-speaking, it was not the term's first appearance in an English text.  W. Hooper had used the 'statistics"" term in 1770 in his translation of J.F. Bielefeld's Elements of Universal Erudition and Eberhard von Zimmerman in his A Political Survey of the Present State of Europe in Sixteen Tables (1787). But these were direct translations of the German word. Sinclair's use was more unique.] Unlike older ""political arithmeticians"", who relied on existing records, Sinclair collected his data by sending out original questionnaires to parish ministers, following these up by visits from his army of ""statistical missionaries"" (Sinclair estimates that 900 individuals were involved).  Sinclair's results were published in 21 large volumes between 1791 and 1799.  Sinclair's census, sometimes called the ""Old Statistical Account"", was the most comprehensive to date and continued to serve until a new account was done in the mid-19th C. But that was not Sinclair's sole activity.  While touring some marginal sheep-farming areas in the Scottish isles, Sinclair realized the need and prospects for improving the British wool industry by protecting herds from disease and improving breeds, but found no organization with the means to promote it.  So, although sitting with the opposition in Parliament, Sir John Sinclair persuaded the Pitt government to establish the ""Board of Agriculture and Internal Improvement"", which was granted a royal charter on August 23, 1793 and a grant-in-aid £3,000.  Sinclair's Board scheme was strongly supported by the English agrarian journalist Sir Arthur Young and, more critically, steered through parliament by the Scottish grandee Henry Dundas (a Pitt ally, then serving as Home Secretary).  Sinclair was appointed its first president, and Young its first secretary. From this perch, Sinclair encouraged the dissemination of ""scientific agriculture"" and new farming and herding techniques throughout Britain.  In his words, the objective  of the Board was to ensure that ""every field would soon be cultivated to the best advantage, and every species of stock would soon be brought to their greatest possible perfection"".  Sinclair would serve on the board until 1809.  After his retirement, the Board declined and was eventually abolished in 1822.  Sinclair originally wanted the Board of Agriculture to deploy the Church of England parish clergy to compile a detailed ""Statistical Account of England"", as he had accomplished in Scotland.  But the Anglican Church was too disorganized and unwilling to pull it off.  So Sinclair revised his plans and had the Board collect more loose agricultural information from all the counties of Great Britain.  The county reports trickled in the 1790s and were published by the Board as the ""General Views of Agriculture"" collection.  The country reports of the General Views were not as systematic as the Scottish statistical account, but rather reported by a variety of interested farmers, surveyors and other amateur volunteers throughout England, Wales and Scotland, each in their own idiosyncratic way.  Some of the data was eventually compiled and published by Sinclair himself in his own Code of Agriculture. Historians frequently blame Sir John Sinclair's 1791 Statistical Account and his promotion of ""improvement"" for unleashing the tragedy of the ""Highland Clearances"" - the wholesale expulsion of tenants by clan chiefs in the Scottish Highlands to make way for sheep.  The clearances began (or certainly accelerated) in the 1790s and would continue through the 19th Century. Sinclair participated in the Bullionist debate (1810, 1817), and was against the resumption of payment in specie, and the continuation of paper currency.

Hans W. Singer, 1910-2006,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/singer.htm," German pioneer of development economics. Of German Jewish extraction, Hans Wolfgang Singer was born in Elberfeld, in the Rhineland, Germany. Singer studied under Joseph Schumpeter and Spiethoff at the University of Bonn.  Rising Nazi violence (and the murder of his father) prompted Singer to flee to Istanbul in 1932.  By the good offices of Schumpeter, Singer found his way to Kings College, Cambridge in 1933 where he completed his degree under J.M. Keynes and Colin Clark in 1936. Singer signed up with the Pilgrim Trust Enquiry on Unemployment. In 1938, he began teaching at Manchester,  where he produced his early surveys on unemployment (1938, 1940). In 1947, Singer moved onto the United Nations, with which he would be associated for much of his career (he had a simultaneous appointment at the New School). Singer's famous 1950 empirical paper assessing the ""costs"" of international trade for developing countries caused a furor in the profession - bringing him into the firing range of leading trade theorists such as Viner and Haberler. What has since become known as the ""Prebisch-Singer"" thesis (as Rául Prebisch independently argued it), became all the rage in both development theory and development practice as import substitution strategies were advocated and pursued by Third World countries. Singer expanded upon his initial findings to develop Nurkse's theory of ""balanced growth"", where countries pursued a strategy of development in which all sectors of the economy grew proportionately without turning countries into one-industry economies. This necessitated tearing away from the core-periphery relationships implied trade and export-orientation development. Singer later muted his doubts by regarding industrialization as ultimately, a good thing and arguing that export orientation was could be beneficial if the terms of trade were not unfavorable. He has remained a lifelong advocate of foreign aid to developing countries - sharing none of the conventional qualms of the impact of direct food aid on local production. Like Prebisch and Myrdal, with whom he is often associated, Singer was highly influential upon the Neo-Marxist development theorists such as Paul Baran and A.G. Frank, without counting himself among them.    After retiring from the UN Secretariat in 1969, Hans Singer returned to Britain, joining the faculty at the University of Sussex. Singer became a naturalized British citizen and was knighted in 1994.      Major Works of Hans Singer     Resources on H.W. Singer   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Jean-Charles-Leonard Simonde de Sismondi, 1773-1842.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sismondi.htm,"  Swiss historian, early socialist and great rival of Jean-Baptiste Say and the French Liberal School.  Jean-Charles-Léonard Simonde de Sismondi was born in Geneva, Switzerland, but history straddles the neighboring countries. The Sismondis were originally a patrician family in Medieval Pisa, Italy, but took refuge in France in the early 16th C. as a result of the Guelf-Ghibelline conflicts.  They established themselves in the southern Dauphiné region, where their surname was gallicized to ""Simonde"".  Won over to Protestant Calvinism, the Sismondes became just another family of French Huguenots.  They had to flee again after the 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and established themselves in the Republic of Geneva, rising to a high position in the city's hierarchy.   It was apparently Sismondi's father who, after a sojourn in Italy c.1785, decided to revive the Italian spelling of his noble ancestry, and created the double surname ""Simonde de Sismondi"". After completing school by the age of sixteen, Sismondi was dispatched to Lyons to apprentice as a clerk in a commercial house.  He was caught there by the French Revolution, and tumults in Lyons in 1792 forced him to return to Geneva.  The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, and the spread of revolutionary sentiment overturned the Genevan government in December 1792, and the aristocratic Sismondis were arrested and their property seized by the new populist authorities.  Upon their release in 1793, the Sismondis promptly emigrated to England. The next year, after selling their remaining family properties in Geneva, the Sismondis emigrated to Tuscany, setting up a family farm near Pescia.  Sismondi's experiences here led to his first work (1801).  Sismondi returned to Geneva (now annexed to France) in 1800, and took up a job as secretary in the chamber of commerce .  His first economics treatise on Richesse Commerciale (1803), compared the systems of the Physiocrats and Adam Smith.  At this time, Sismondi was an enthusiast of Smith, and defended his economics and liberal policy recommendations.  Sismondi's treatise competed with the simultaneous one of Jean-Baptiste Say in popularizing Adam Smith's ideas in France. Sismondi's big project, begun in 1796 while in Italy, was a comparative examination of political constitutions (a work he never quite finished). It was in pursuit of this topic that Sismondi began to closely research the history of the Medieval Italian republics.  The outcome was his monumental Histoire des republiques italiennes, the first and probably still unsurpassed history of the Medieval republics from the 11th C. communal era to the 16th C. renaissance.  The first of its sixteen volumes came out in 1807, and would only be completed in 1818.  He interrupted it in the middle to compose a set of essays on Italian and southern European literature (1813), the outcome of a set of lectures he gave in Geneva in 1811.  During this period, Sismondi was a frequent guest in the household of Jacques Necker, and became a close friend of his daughter, the Madame de Staël, accompanying her on travels to Italy in 1805 and Germany in 1807. This raised a few eyebrows, but the attraction seemed  merely intellectual.  His exposition of southern European literature complemented her own work on northern German one.  He also got involved in the agitation over slavery, writing two notable tracts against the slave trade in 1814, and another in 1817. After the collapse of Napoleon's empire in 1814, Geneva recovered her independence, and Sismondi was elected a member of the sovereign council of the reborn republic.  Sismondi happened to be in Paris in early 1815 when Napoleon's returned.  Sismondi wrote a series of articles for the Moniteur, uncharacteristically defending the cause of the emperor he had previously despised.. But Benjamin Constant's ""Acte Additionnel"" seemed to be sufficient guarantee, and he vigorously defended it.  A grateful Napoleon offered Sismondi the Legion of Honor, but he turned it down. (Sismondi would accept it from Louis Philippe in 1841). In 1815, Simonde de Sismondi wrote his article ""Political Economy"" for Brewster's Edinburgh Encyclopaedia.  It is here that Sismondi first articulates his original thesis on economics, including labor problems and overproduction.  His visit to England at the height of its post-war depression impressed him greatly.  Upon his return, Sismondi elaborated on these ideas in his main economics work, Nouveaux principes (1819, and further expanded in  the second edition 1827).  Simonde de Sismondi was no friend of the rising capitalist industrial system, which he viewed as being detrimental to the interests of the poor and particularly prone to crisis brought about by an insufficient general demand for goods.    His underconsumption thesis was shared by Robert Malthus, and sparked off the General Glut Controversy of the 1820s where their theories were pitted against those of Say, Ricardo and the Classicals.  Say and Sismondi squared off in 1824 in the pages of the Revue Encyclopédique. Sismondi was only half-able to follow the debate, his attentions now divided..  He finally got married in 1819 , and thereafter began working on his new grand multi-volume historical work, on the history of the French, beginning with Clovis's Franks.  The first volume was published in 1821, and continued for the next two decades.  He turned down chairs in economics and history in France, preferring to focus on writing.  He produced some derivative works, e.g. helping Lardner put out an abridgement of his Italian history in 1821 (and putting out a French version himself), he gave a series of lectures on early Medieval history in Geneva in 1821 (later published in 1835, in Lardner's Cyclopedia), he put out a historical novel (Julia Severa) in 1822. In 1836, Sismondi finally put out his study on political constitutions begun four decades earlier.  Shortly after, Sismondi put out a series of economic essay 1837-38, going over some of the details of his economic ideas.  But the history of France was occupying most of his labors. Having taken it down to the end of 16th C., exhausted, Sismondi decided to wind up the work, and put out an abridgement in 1839, planning only to summarize the remaining two centuries.  But he was pressed by his friends to continue in the same detail as he had before, so Sismondi returned to his pen and plodded on.   He finished the 29th volume, which ended in 1789, only a few weeks before his death in 1842.  The 30th volume, completing the history of France after 1789, was written by someone else.

Eugene Slutsky, 1880-1948.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/slutsky.htm," Russian economist and statistician. Eugene (or Eugen or Yevgeni) Slutsky intended to become a mathematician, but he was expelled from the University of Kiev for participating in student revolts.  After some wandering through engineering in Munich, he returned to Kiev and ended up getting a doctorate in law in 1911.  He went on to teach at the Kiev Institute of Commerce in 1913. By now, Slutsky had a fine sample from several fields. It was the work of the Lausanne School in economics that attracted him and yielded up his first economics paper in 1915 - published in Italy (at the time, the last citadel of of Walrasian economics). In his 1915 paper, he presented the ""Slutsky decomposition"" of demand functions into substitution and income effects. His work was ignored and only much later, when the same principle was resurrected independently by John Hicks and R.G.D. Allen in 1934, did he eventually get some recognition. Slutsky moved to Moscow in 1926, joining Kondratiev's Conjucture Insittute.  Kondratiev had just published his long cycle theory, which provoked a controversy with Trotsky and other luminaries.  Slutsky contributed to the debate with his seminal 1927 article, .showing that a series of shocks can be summed up to yield regular cyclical properties, i.e. Kondratiev's long cycle was just a coincidence. Slutsky's 1927 paper, which paralleled that of Frisch was the beginning of the  shock-dependent business cycle that precedes the New Classical theory of today. The corollary Slutsky-Yule Theorem (i.e. that the moving average of a random series may generate oscillatory movement when no oscillations exist in the original data) was also laid out in that paper. The rest of his work was in probability theory. The famous ""Slutsky Theorem"" which argued that if a statistic converges almost surely or in probability to some constant, then any continuous function of that statistic also converges in the same manner to some function of that constant - a theorem with applications all over statistics and econometrics - was laid out in his 1925 paper. Other limit theorems were provided in 1928 and 1929.  Slutsky became a member of the Mathematical Institute at Moscow University in 1934, and then in 1936, in the Moscow Academy of Sciences.

William Smart, 1853-1915.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/smart.htm,"  Scottish businessman, economist and popularizer of the Austrian School.  Born into a Glaswegian manufacturing family, William Smart's studies at the University of Glasgow were interrupted at the age of seventeen to take a job in his father's thread-works business.   He would attempt to balance his studies and his business responsibilities, finally taking an MA in 1882.  It was only in 1884, after his father's death and the sale of the firm, that Smart would have the freedom to concentrate on his intellectual interests. Perhaps as a result of his first hand experience with the industrial mill system, Smart was early drawn to the Victorian romantic critics Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin, carrying on a private correspondence with the latter and serving as the founding president of the Ruskin Society of Glasgow.  But he was soon drawn to teaching economics,  first as an assistant to Edward Caird at Glasgow, and then, in 1886, on his own at University College Dundee and Queen Margaret College, Glasgow.  It was around this time that Smart came across the Austrian economists and set it upon himself to introduce them to the English-speaking world..  His principal contribution was his famous 1891 monograph on the Austrian theory of value, while simultaneously translating Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk Capital and Interest (1890) and Positive Theory of Capital (1891) and supervising the translation of Friedrich von Wieser's Natural Value (1893).  Smart's own Studies in Economics (1895) demonstrates his own mastery of the theory, applying Austrian perspective to bear on various economic issues of the day.  He would soon move away from strict Austrianism, and in the 1910 edition of his 1891 primer, Smart tacked on an appendix which had a more Marshallian perspective. Smart had taken up a lectureship at the University of Glasgow in 1892.  In 1896, Smart applied and won the newly-created of the Adam Smith Professorship at the University of Glasgow.  Although a popular teacher, Smart's chances seemed compromised by his opposition of the then-dominant Marshallian school and his peculiar policy ideas (esp. bimetallism).  Nonetheless, Smart prevailed and retained the professorship, which we would retain until his death in 1915. Outside his Austrian work, Smart's influence was primarily in the classroom and as a popular speaker and writer on policy  issues, from free trade to the poor law reform (he served on the 1905 commission).  His Economic Annals (1910, 1917) provide an excellent overview of the history of economic policy between 1801 and 1830, the formative years of the Classical school.

Adam Smith, 1723-1790.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/smith.htm,"  Scottish philosopher and economist, leading figure of the Scottish Enlightenment, widely regarded as the 'father of economics' and founder of the Classical School. Adam Smith was born Kirkcaldy, Scotland, to a Protestant Whig family of civil servants and lawyers.  His father, a commissioner of customs at Kirkcaldy (a small port across the Forth river from Edinburgh) died a few months before he was born, leaving the sickly young Adam to be raised by his mother Margaret Douglas, by all accounts a formidable personality who encouraged Adam Smith's scholarly pursuits and to whom he maintained a lifelong attachment. Adam Smith attended the local Kirkcaldy Burgh school and in 1737, at the age of fourteen, enrolled at the University of Glasgow, where he came under the influence of moral philosopher Francis Hutcheson, and took up an interest in Newtonian science and Stoic philosophy.  Glasgow was then the leading seaport of Scotland, deeply engaged in American tobacco trade.  The bustle of the rising commercial center and its merchant community almost certainly impressed themselves on young Adam Smith's outlook. In July 1740, Smith left Glasgow  to take up a scholarship (the £40 'Snell Exhibition') to study classics and modern languages at Balliol College, Oxford, notionally en route to a clerical career in the Episcopalian church.  By all accounts, his period at Oxford doesn't seem to have been as stimulating as Glasgow.  Winding up his studies in August 1746, Smith returned to Scotland, where he spent a quiet sojourn of two years in his mother's home in Kirkcaldy.     In 1745, when Smith was still in Oxford, Scotland was shaken by the Jacobite Rebellion.   The rebellion failed and in the aftermath, it became clear that poor, traditional Scotland would be permanently integrated with wealthier, dynamic England.  This prospect exercised the Scottish intellectuals and academics of the day. Their speculative histories, theories and debates on the evolution and progress of civilizations, the central subject matter of the Scottish Enlightenment, may have been grand in panorama, but they were also addressing very local questions about Scotland's future. It was precisely at this time that Adam Smith left quiet Kirkcaldy and entered the ferment of Edinburgh intellectual circles.  At the instigation of Henry Home, Lord Kames, Smith had been invited in November 1748 to deliver a series of  public lectures on rhetoric at Edinburgh University, sponsored by the Philosophical Society.  This was followed up by additional lectures on the History of Philosophy and Jurisprudence.  Little remains of the content of Smith's Edinburgh lectures, save perhaps for his essay on the intellectual history of astronomy (what Smith later derided as a 'juvenile' effort and was only published posthumously in 1795).     It was during this period (1748-51) as a freelance lecturer that Smith met and befriended David Hume and other  leading lights of the Scottish Enlightenment.  Smith's Edinburgh lectures were a relative success.  So, in January 1751, Adam Smith was unanimously elected to the recently vacant Chair of Logic at his old alma mater, Glasgow University, beginning the course in October 1751.  According to his student John Millar, Adam Smith took an innovative approach to the logic course, discarding its usual Aristotlean treatment of the subject in favor of the study of rhetoric (evidently drawing upon his earlier Edinburgh lectures). But just before his arrival, Smith was asked to also take up part of the lectures in moral philosophy for Thomas Craigie (Hutcheson's successor), who had fallen gravely ill.  So, in his first year at Glasgow Smith had to do two different lecture courses.  In April 1752, Cragie having died, Smith was unanimously elected to the Chair of Moral Philosophy.  His old friend David Hume applied for the Chair of Logic vacated by Smith, but there was strong opposition to the appointment of free-thinking Hume by Presbyterian ministers.  In the end, bowing to public pressure, Smith failed to support Hume, and the project was thwarted (the logic chair ultimately went to another candidate, James Clow).  Smith would remain professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow from 1752 to 1764.   Following the traditional outline laid out in its principal textbook, Frances Hutcheson's Philosophae Moralis. Smith's course on moral philosophy at Glasgow was divided into four parts - natural theology, ethics, jurisprudence and the nature of political institutions.  His early lectures probably drew material from Hutcheson's text and his own Edinburgh lectures,  but eventually Smith began elaborating anew upon these topics himself. Although residing in Glasgow, Smith frequently sojourned to Edinburgh to visit his old enlightenment comrades.  Smith was a member of the Edinburgh Select Society and the Poker Club and contributed two small articles to the fledgling Edinburgh Review in 1755. Hoping to lure him permanently, in 1758,  David Hume attempted to get Smith transferred to the chair in public law at the University of Edinburgh (simultaneously hoping to open up Smith's position at Glasgow for Adam Ferguson) but nothing came of this scheme. Adam Smith's first published treatise, the Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759), draws evidently from the second part of the course.  It was just another salvo in the long-gestating quarrel in Scottish circles over the anthropological-social origin of moral codes and moral sense, a debate provoked by Mandeville's notorious Fable in the 1720s.  Specifically, the Scottish philosophers were trying to explain how and why natural, pleasure-seeking hedonistic man would ever come up with apparently stern constraints such as morality.   Hutcheson's explanation was that moral acts naturally produce feelings of pleasure ergo morality is inherently hedonistic.  This was turned upside down by Hume, who, drawing on Hobbes, argued instead that moral codes are not inherently anything, but merely social constructs that had been opportunistically tailored sometime in the past to comply with human hedonism.  Hume's 'realistic' solution seemed to reduce morality to crass calculation - that humans did what felt good first and wrote moral codes afterwards to justify their choices.  Hume did not go as far as Hobbes in reducing all selfless moral acts as somehow ultimately reducible to selfish motivation - Hume inserted the element of ""sympathy"" with the pleasure and pains of others to explain ethical actions, but it was still ultimately about hedonic passions. Smith's TMS tried to find the middle ground between Hutcheson and Hume by proposing the artifice of the 'impartial spectator'.  Yes, Smith argues, morality springs from the hedonic calculus, but it is not a wholly passions.  We are capable, by the power of imagination and reason, of taking the role of impartial spectator.  He expands Hume's power of 'sympathy' to include not only sympathy with the passions of pleasure and pain in others, but also sympathy with the motives of the person acting and the gratitude of the recipient.  Heuristically, the apparently altruistic act of saving a drowning child is not motivated by the expectation of a reward from the parents (as Hobbes might suggest), nor because the act of saving a life produces its own pleasure (as Hutcheson might assert), nor simply because we are capable of transferring unto ourselves the pain of the parents of the drowning child (as Hume suggests), but rather a more complicated internal calculation.  The impartial spectator is the internal judge of our actions and can, by his experience and inductive reason, disapprove a failure to act or commend the heroic attempt to save the child, and this is the principal pleasure and pain calculation at work.  Crudely put, moral sense is but the desire for praiseworthiness and the pain of guilt, as delivered via the impartial spectator.   The TMS cemented Smith's reputation, but he put the topic aside once completed and began his investigations on the third part of his moral philosophy course: natural jurisprudence.  At the end of the TMS, Smith had already sketched a history of natural law, highlighting the importance of the work of Grotius.   It is said Smith intended to write a larger treatise on the matter, using Montesquieu as a model. But this treatise -  if he began one - never emerged.  Instead, all we have are two sets of lecture notes from his Glasgow course - one from the 1762-63 session and a second set from the 1763-64 session - that were discovered and published later.  The latter (manuscript dated '1766', thus probably a re-draft of the 1763-64 lecture notes) was discovered and first published by Edwin Cannan in 1896. The first set from 1762-63 (rougher and thus probably taken directly from the lectures), was discovered only in 1958 by J.M. Lothian and first published in the Glasgow edition of Smith's works (1976-81). These two sets of notes, are now commonly collected as the ''Lectures on Jurisprudence''. It is important to note that in the section on 'Police' in the Lectures on Jurisprudence, Smith provides early discussions of ideas that will be later elaborated upon his magnum opus, e.g. the division of labor, its connection to national opulence, natural versus market prices, the origin of money, critiques of monopolies, tariffs, subsidies, and other government distortions, the errors of Mercantilism,  economic history of commerce, review of taxes and public debt, etc. Fragments of  early drafts of what seems like an attempt to put these parts into a treatise, some of which are dated as early as 1762, were found later by W.R. Scott, and published in 1937.  However, some topics of the LJ - e.g. discussions of the 'natural wants of mankind' (i.e. consumption), public sanitation, the Mississippi scheme, stock-jobbing, effect of commerce on public manners - will not make their way into the WN. Additionally, again in 1958, Lothian found a set of notes on a different Smith lecture of 1762-63, Smith's 'private' class on rhetoric at Glasgow (in contrast with his 'public' lectures on moral philosophy).  It is assumed these evolved from his earlier Edinburgh lectures. These notes was first published in 1963, under the title of Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres. In 1763,  English Secretary of State Charles Townshend invited Adam Smith to accompany his stepson, the young Henry Scott, Duke of Buccleuch, on a European tour.  In January 1764, Smith resigned his Glasgow chair to take up the offer.  Smith traveled as the tutor of the young duke to Paris, proceeding almost immediately to Toulouse, where they stayed for nearly eighteen months.  Thereafter, they proceeded through the south of France to Geneva and then back to Paris in December 1765.  In Paris, through the duke's good connections, Smith met the leading French Enlightenment economists and thinkers such as the Jacques Necker, d'Alembert, Helvétius, the Physiocrat leader François Quesnay,  and, perhaps most influential of all,  Jacques Turgot and the Abbé Morellet.  Buccleuch and Smith  returned to London in October, 1766.  Smith proceeded almost immediately to Kirkcaldy, where he remained quietly for the next ten years, interrupted by only occasional trips to Edinburgh and London.  It was in this period that he composed his masterpiece, the Wealth of Nations, which finally appeared in  March 1776.  The core of this work was already articulated in the early 1760s, in his lectures on jurisprudence, the latter part of his moral philosophy course at Glasgow.  But his sojourn in France had provided tremendous inspiration and ample new material.  The purpose of Smith's treatise - like so many others of the 18th C. - was to influence government policy.  That is, to urge the repeal of many of the British laws that restricted internal and external commerce, many of which had been introduced during the  Mercantilist era.  As a result, there was a twofold object to the book - to criticize the current system and the economic principles upon which it is based, and to propose a new reformed system of 'natural liberty'.  The latter task moved the book from a mere critical polemic to a constructive one, which required the the careful exposition of the economic principles underlying the system.  These economic principles were a novelty, a new unfamiliar economic theory (although much the same principles can be found among Continental economists, notably Jacques Turgot, it was largely unknown in British literature).   It is sometimes noted that Sir James Steuart, perhaps the most notable contemporary representative of the Mercantilist views that Smith set out to debunk, also shared some of the theoretical principles, although he is not cited in WN. The Wealth of Nations is set out in five books, the first of which is perhaps the most theoretically important.  Here Smith opens with his famous discussion of division of labor, illustrated by his 'pin-factory' example, before proceeding to a discussion of long-run natural prices (which he distinguishes from short-run supply-and-demand-determined market prices). Perhaps excusably for someone pioneering new ground, Smith inadvertently provides three or four different theories of natural value - the labor-commanded theory, the labor-embodied theory, the adding-up (cost of production) theory and (it has been argued) a disutility of work theory.  Smith picks the third cost of production theory and spends the remainder of Book I attempting to provide theories for the determination of the components of natural price - the natural wage  (a discussion relying partly on Cantillon's wage-fertility dynamics), the natural rate of profit (where his discussion of  competition and the uniformity of the rate of profit is focused) and the natural rent (where he provides contradictory theories, starting with a simplistic theory of rent as a cost component, before coming around to embrace Quesnay's concept of rent as a deduction from the surplus)  Book II of WN is focused on economic growth and capital accumulation.  This is the book that owes most to Smith's encounter with the French economists (hardly any part of it is presaged in the LJ)  Here Smith sets out his 'balance sheet' approach to capital stock, the role of money and the banking system, fluctuations in the rate of interest, and the relationship between capital stock and labor employment, including the famous differentiation of 'productive' from 'unproductive' labor, and a comparative discussion of the deployment of capital in different sectors.   Book III is an economic history of the Middle Ages, showing how capital had first been applied to agriculture, then manufacturing and finally commerce, and how current policies in Europe seem to be trying to reverse that direction of natural evolution.  Book IV contains Smith's scathing exposition of Mercantilism - and thus the part that perhaps was most immediately absorbed by contemporary readers.  He mocks the Mercantilists for confusing wealth of a nation with money (stock of gold and silver), and tying prosperity to a favorable balance of trade.  He reviews how their economic policies - protectionist tariffs, predatory export subsidies, monopolies, distortionary treaties - are actually detrimental to the national economic interest.  It is here that Adam Smith puts up his vigorous defense of free trade (in the form of the theory of absolute advantage):  ""What is prudence in the conduct of every private family, can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom.  If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way which we have some advantage."", [Bk IV.2],[p.36 of orig. ed. p.457 of Glasg ed], We also find here his famous 'invisible hand' passage (p.454-56), articulating how self-seeking behavior may unknowingly promote the public good - the old Mandeville message, that has since became the core 'ethical' cornerstone of the Classical Liberal defense of capitalism: ""Every individual is continually exerting himself to find out the most advantageous employment for whatever capital he can command. It is his own advantage, indeed, not that of society, which he has in view. But the study of his own advantage naturally, or rather necessarily leads him to prefer that employment which is most advantageous to society..... He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it.....and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part his intention."" (Bk IV.2, p.454-6). Smith also discusses colonies, giving a general history of their development and connection to commercial monopolies.  Having reviewed its history and policies, Smith finally proceeds to pronounce his verdict on Mercantilism. Declaring that the improvement of living standards of citizens should be ""the sole end and purpose"" (p.660) of economic policy,  the Mercantile system has utterly failed to deliver. In the final part, Smith critically reviews the Physiocratic doctrines and condemns their agricultural obsession, being about as misdirected as the Mercantilist obsession with trade.  Smith rounds off this section with a rousing call for laissez-faire, to establish an 'obvious and simple system of natural liberty' (p.687), with government involvement limited to three areas: defense, justice and perhaps some public works and infrastructure. The final Book V is a review of contemporary government spending and taxation in 18th C. Britain, reviewing the efficacy of these policies, often in comparison with policies in other countries. Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations made something of a splash at the time.  Coming out at the time of revolt in the American colonies - a direct reaction to some of the British Mercantilist policies he denounced - Smith provided the British public an alternative way of thinking about how economic life and policy should be organized.  While read in many quarters, arguably its most important consumer was the young English Whig politician William Pitt.  After becoming prime minister in 1784, Pitt immediately began an overhaul of taxation and commercial policy, rolling back much of the old Mercantilist apparatus, citing Smith's treatise as his principal source of inspiration.  The 1786 Eden Agreement, lowering tariffs between Britain and France, owed much to the book's influence. Among Scottish philosopher circles, it was naturally well-received.  David Hume saw it and praised it, before his death a few months later in 1776 (Smith wrote a touching memoir of Hume later that year). Smith was a little miffed at Hume's protege Adam Ferguson, whose 1767 Essay had anticipated Smith on ""division of labor"" - Smith privately expressed his belief that Ferguson had plagiarized his Glasgow lecture notes from the early 1760s.  Even if so, the on-going discussions in the Edinburgh clubs and the long gestation period of the WN made it practically inevitable that he would be anticipated in print.   In 1778, Smith was appointed Scottish commissioner of customs and moved to Edinburgh, with his elderly mother and his spinster cousin (Smith was a lifelong bachelor, his cousin discharged the principal housekeeping duties).  Smith's remaining years in Edinburgh turned out to be rather unremarkable.  Smith died quietly in 1790. Despite its outsized impact on policy of the day and its sometimes contradictory statements, there was surprisingly little response or follow-up on Adam Smith's economic theories, at least not immediately.  He hardly touched them himself - the Wealth and Nations went through a few more editions, but with only very minor corrections.  It is only really at the turn of the century - a quarter century after its publication - that we begin to see the first serious reviews and examinations of Smith's theoretical principles.  The complacency of British thinkers during this quarter century may in part be explained by the policy success - the general assumption that Adam Smith had ""gotten it right"" and so there was not much worth discussing.   There were some quibbles here and there and points of policy discussion (former Massachusetts governor Thomas Pownall's 1776 letter to Adam Smith was notable in both regards) but the substance of the economics, by and large, was not much challenged. Dr. James Anderson (1777) provided a significant correction to the theory of rent, but nobody seemed to notice. Jeremy Bentham picked up some points for his defense of usury (1787).  And two decades later, Robert Malthus (1798) took the wage-fertility dynamics and ran with it into a fully-fledged theory of population growth and the natural wage, but this was a distinct effort in its own right.  The first significant evaluations and restatements of Smith's theory were probably the extensive notes of Smith's (third) French translator Comte Germain Garnier (1802) and the remarkable Traité of Jean-Baptiste Say (1803).  (the Abbé Morellet had actually attempted a translation earlier, but gave up with the appearance of the first French translation of theAbbé Blavet). That early energy emanated from French writers should not be surprising - the fledgling French Republic was still trying to find its policy bearings, and besieged by proposals from all kinds of theorists. Physiocracy still had influence, while other segments, notably Napoleon Bonaparte, seemed enamored with Mercantilist logic  French followers of Smith -  the kernel of the French Liberal school. - felt a need to reiterate and restate the basic principles of political economy. Pownall aside, the first significant review of the WN's economic theory in English was probably the latter-day defense of  Physiocratic doctrine by John Gray (1797).  Better-aimed was the critical review by Earl of Lauderdale (1804), demolishing Smith's theory of value.  But it was William Spence's (1807) quixotic attempt to promote protectionist policy, setting up a strange Physiocratic-Mercantilist hybrid contra Smith's theory that finally provoked British followers of Smith to put pen to paper.  James Mill (1808) and Robert Torrens (1808) wrote comprehensive defenses of Smith's theory and policy in reply to Spence.  From there, the flood began.  Thirty years after Smith's WN,  the Classical School of Political Economy finally took wing.  The Smithian theory was given a thorough overhaul by David Ricardo  (1817), who set about systematically revising and correcting many of the tentative or contradictory points in Smith's WN.  Ricardo sorted through the competing theories of value, dumping all but the labor-embodied theory of value, inserted the Andersonian differential theory of rent, brought in the Malthusian wage-population dynamics explicitly, improved upon the theory of trade with comparative advantage, etc.  Through Ricardo, the Classical theory took a clearer shape, and went to dominate economic thinking until the latter part of the 19th C. The fall of Ricardian theory in the late 19th has hardly dimmed the reputation of Adam Smith.  As a pioneer, the acknowledged father of economic theory, Smith's legacy is secure - many histories of economic thought begin with Adam's creation.  In the popular mind, Smith's reputation continues to rest more on his policy advocacy than on his theoretical constructs.  Smith continues to be hailed and cited by proponents of economic liberalism down to the modern day.

Werner Sombart, 1863-1941.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sombart.htm," A leading member of the last generation of German Historical School. Educated at Berlin under Schmoller and Wagner (with side-stints in Pisa and Rome), obtaining his doctorate in 1888 with a historical thesis on the Roman Campagna. In 1890, Werner Sombart appointed to an academic position in political sciences at the University of Breslau, where he remained until 1906.  He subsequently took an appointment at the Berlin technical Hochschule. Sombart finally succeeded to Wagner's chair at Berlin in 1917. Werner Sombart's early Marxian writings (1894, 1896, 1902) - which include two laudatory studies of its founders (1895, 1909) - did much to disengage the German Historical School from the heritage of the Schmoller group. However, in his later work, Sombart began giving way to a more conservative and nationalist and finally a overtly Nazi position,  This turnaround might perhaps be explained by the fact that Sombart lived in the margins of German academia for so long and felt that he needed to become political acceptable in order to earn a high academic appointment (eventually at Berlin in 1917, succeeding Wagner and Schmoller, both of whom died that year). Alternatively, some claim that Sombart was but a quintessential German ""romantic nationalist"" - worshipping all heroes, whether they stood in factory workboots or in Prussian cavalry boots. In Sombart, the entrepreneur was lauded quickly enough, together with the militant worker and later on,, the ""Führer"".  In contrast, throughout most of his works, the ""bourgeoisie"", from whatever the vantage point, was consistently denigrated. Sombart's exaggerated and fanciful style of writing certainly gave evidence for that explanation. Although Sombart's later work, in its content as well as in its bombastic style, has earned him little respect both within and without the economics world, it has nonetheless been colorful. Like Weber, he sought to turn Marx on his head.  The roots of capitalism, Sombart claimed, came not from economic reality but rather from an idea - namely, the Enlightenment ideal of reason and control of nature. He claimed this in his high-water book, Modern Capitalism (1902) - still lauded as a masterpiece today by sociologists and ""total history"" scholars such as Fernand Braudel. Although still characteristically fanciful and poorly researched in its economic and historical content, the methodological principles of the youngest historical school were laid out in this treatise, breaking with the Schmoller variety of practical, normative inductivism and engendering the positivist study of what Spiethoff would later call ""economic styles"". Sombart's 1911 work traced capitalist acquisitiveness and success to the spread and rise of Jews in Central and Northern Europe - directly contradicting Weber's famous thesis relating it to Protestantism. His work on Jews earned him no friends -- Jews and liberals found it crudely anti-Semitic, while anti-Semites and conservatives considered it too pro-Semitic.  By and large, scholars found its sources (if given) questionable and without research merit. But Sombart's book was sadly successful on the marketplace. It had a popular impact which was, if anything, infinitely lamentable.  It provided the economic, racial, philosophical and historical ""evidence"" for the distorted portrait of the stereotypical crafty Jewish capitalist which was then gaining wider acceptance in Europe. In a later work (1913), Sombart changed tack again.  Now he tried to forge a relation between the development of trade and cities to the emergence of capitalism -- a wholly more worthwhile treatise, replicated in more recent years by economic historians such as Henri Pirenne. However, he could not control his outrageous imagination.  At one point, Sombart decided to blame capitalism on women - or rather, on the idea that the emergence of idle middle-class females had forced men to provide the luxurious gifts they fussily demanded, thereby engendering in males the spirit of capitalist acquisition. In 1915, Sombart finally broke out into complete romantic nationalism with a heavy-handed attack on Great Britain with his Händler und Helden, directly transferring his anti-Semitic stereotype of the ""crafty trading people"" from Jews to Englishmen. This was followed up with the utterly and explicitly Nazi book Deutscher Socialismus (1934, translated as A New Social Philosophy). This shameful work, which became a highly-distributed textbook in Nazi Germany, was the culmination of Sombart's confused life.

Robert M. Solow, 1924-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/solow.htm," Robert Solow is one of the major figures of the Neo-Keynesian Synthesis macroeconomics. Together with Paul Samuelson, he formed the core of the M.I.T. economics department which has been widely viewed as the ""mainstream"" of the post-war period. Together, Solow and Samuelson have contributed to various landmark pieces of work: e.g. on von Neumann growth theory (1953), on capital theory (1956), on linear programming (1958) and on the Phillips Curve (1960). Individually, Robert Solow is best known for his work on the Neoclassical growth model (1956, 1970). His use of an aggregate production function in that paper launched the Cambridge Capital Controversy with pitted Solow and Samuelson against Joan Robinson and the Cambridge Keynesians. His various papers on the issue of capital bear out the magnitude of the problem (1963, 1967). In turn, Solow also got imbroiled with Kaldor on the issue of growth and technological progress (1957, 1960). He was also one of the co-inventors of the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function (1961).  He is also responsible for exploring and popularizing the ""long-run multiplier"" derived from a dynamic government budget constraint. (1973) It was Solow's work on growth that earned him a Nobel Memorial prize in 1987   Robert Merton Solow was born in Brooklyn, New York, and enrolled at Harvard in 1940 at the relatively young age of 16, interrupting his studies in 1942 to serve in the US army in WWII. He returned to Harvard in 1945, proceeding on to graduate school in economics there, coming under the tutelage of Wassily Leontief, writing a thesis on the empirics of household income distribution.

Joseph von Sonnenfels, 1733-1817.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sonnenfels.htm," Highly powerful and influential Austrian Neo-Cameralist, and perhaps the most far-sighted of them. Joseph von Sonnenfels was not over-enthralled by the absolutist state and had a very practical sense of administrative policy.  Sonnenfels advocated liberal tax reforms and government expenditures to promote general public welfare.  Joseph von Sonnenfels was born of modest family of assimilated Jews from Moravia.  He served in the Austrian army, before enrolling at the University of Vienna in 1754, graduating in 1758.  He worked for a while as a journalist, unable to secure an academic position.  Finally, in 1763, Sonennfels managed to persuade the Empress Maria Theresa to establish a chair in policy and cameralistics (""polizei- und cameral wissenschaft"") at the University of Vienna in 1763.  Sonnenfels originally relied on the works of Justi and Forbonnais for his lectures.  But in 1765 Sonnenfels produced his own three-volume textbook.  Sonnenfels's Grundsätze remained the standard textbook at Vienna until 1848.  His second volume (dedicated to commerce) contains an extensive discussion of civilizational progress, linked to exchange and the division of labor.  Despite his attachment to public welfare as the object and measure of State policy, Sonnenfels remained a Mercantilist in his policy outlook, encouraging the promotion exports and curtailing of imports.  Sonnenfels lived to see the rise of Classical economics, and modernized his views a bit.

Hugo Sonnenschein, 1940-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sonnenschein.htm," A prominent Walrasian theorist, his various contributions to economics are dominated by one shattering result: the Debreu-Sonnenschein-Mantel Theorem. First explored by Sonnenschein in two papers (1972, 1973) and then followed up by similar papers by Debreu (1972) and Mantel (1974), the DSM Theorem claims that market demand functions, upon which all the ""intuitive"" results of market-level and macro-level economics rest, are essentially shapeless. It essentially destroyed the ""microfoundations"" project of economic theory, i.e. to describe demand and supply as a result of the decentralized utility-maximizing agents.  The DSM theorem provides the following result: even if everybody has nicely-shaped individual demand functions, we cannot say that the market demand function will possess a nice shape too. Thus, the efforts that have been made in the last century to describe demand as a result of utility-maximization are essentially wasted - for the desired result Hugo Sonenschein obtained his B.A. at Rochester in 1961 and his Ph.D. from Purdue in 1964. He was subsequently professor at the University of Minnesota, then from 1970 at Massachusetts-Amherst, then Northwestern from 1973, then Princeton from 1976.
In 1988, Sonnenschein became dean at the University of Pennsylvania, returning to Princeton in 1991 , then moving to Chicago in 1993.  Sonnenschein was President of the University of Chicago from 1993 to 2000, where continues as professor.

Georges Sorel, 1847-1922.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sorel.htm,"  Theorist of French revolutionary syndicalism. Georges Eugène Sorel was the sometimes incomprehensible spirit behind the French ""syndicalist"" movement of the turn of the centrury.  The syndicalist movement sparked in 1895 in an attempt to recapture the initiative away from reformist state socialists and bring the workers' movement back to its roots in the revolutionary anarcho-socialism of Proudhon and Bakunin that had so shaken the world back in the 1840s and 1850s.  Although he claimed himself to be a Marxian, Sorel held a deep suspicion for ""armchair socialists"", particularly those who mumbled about the inevitability of ""progress"".  Instead, Sorel advocated massive general strikes and worker action -- not for the small concessions from employers those might bring, but rather as a way of continuously disrupting the capitalism industrial machine and thus eventually achieving worker control of means of production.  In his most famous work, Réflexions sur la violence, (1908), Sorel emphasized the violent and irrational motivations of social and economic conduct (echoing Pareto in many ways).  His identification of the need for a deliberately-conceived ""myth"" to sway crowds into concerted action was put to use by the Fascist and Communist movements of the 1920s and after. Georges Sorel himself was a retired engineer of middle class origins when he began writing. He kept himself at an arm's distance from actual sabotage, boycotts and strikes conducted by the syndicalist movement in the early part of the century.

Domingo de Soto, 1494-1560,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/soto.htm," 16th C. Spanish theologian of the Salamanca School. Dominican theologian, born in Segovia and trained in Alcala and Paris. Domingo de Soto was a professor of  theology at the University of Salamanca from 1532, contemporaneously with Francisco de Vitoria (whom he first met in Paris).  Highly influential in his own right, De Soto became a confessor of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and, in 1545, was appointed emperor's representative at the Council of Trent.  De Soto's economic reflections are found principally in his De Justicia et jure (1552), taken down from his lectures at Salamanca.  Although De Soto's reasoning is frequently different from the Scholastic doctrine, his conclusions are more timid and generally in line with the conventional views.  In this, de Soto was frequently at odds with his more liberal colleague Navarrus.  De Soto was less enamored with markets, and embraced State price controls not only as a practicality, but as an ideal. He spent some time pondering the Great Inflation, noting in particular the depressing influence the influx of Peruvian silver on the value of Spanish coin, and on its exchange rate abroad, thus articulating an early version of the purchasing power parity theory. While generally backing the Church ban on usury, sometimes quite vigorously, Domingo de Soto nonetheless sought exceptions and helped undermine its basis by dismissing earlier interpretations and finding usury only contrary to natural law, not contrary to theology.  He defended the price differential in usury as compatible with ""just price"" and was keen on personal annuities, but adamant about holding the line elsewhere.

Thomas Spence, 1750-1814,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/tspence.htm," Early English agrarian socialist.

A poor schoolteacher from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, of Scottish descent, Thomas Spence started his career as an advocate of a new system of phonetic spelling.  But Spence's principal claim to fame is his lecture on the ""Real Rights of Man"" read to the Philosophical Society of Newcastle in 1775, which earned him a brief notoriety.  Echoing Rousseau's essay on inequality, Spence laid out an image of man in a state of nature with common land, identified the claim of private property on land as an injustice and the origins of tyranny.  Spence's system called for the abolition of private property in land, and the adoption of a new communist system of land ownership. He envisaged the formation local parish corporations, which would lay claim to ownership of all land in the district, and allocate it accordingly.  Rent would still be charged, but it would all go to the parish corporation who would invest in improvements and other public works.  In the Spencean utopia, all taxes would be abolished, save for a land tax on the rent collected by the commune.  Spence's lecture got him ejected from the Philosophical Society - ostensibly for printing and distributing the lecture without the Society's consent.  Spence continued to agitate for land nationalization. He was jailed for a time in 1784 in for exhorting a violent land uprising against landlords.  He moved to London in 1792, where he eked out a living as a bookcart peddlar putting out occasional pamphlets. He edited a small journal, Pig's Meat, reprinting selections from radical writers like William Godwin and Joseph Priestley. He became a member of the London Corresponding Society, supportive of the French Revolution.  Spence was arrested and jailed again for a year for his 1801 tract, deemed seditious by the English authorities. Spence's followers would form the Society for Spencean Philanthropists.  The Spencean movement would be later overshadowed and displaced by other utopian socialists, like Robert Owen..

William Spence, 1783-1860,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/wspence.htm," Yorkshire Entomologist, with a brief walk-on role in the history of economics.  The young William Spence wrote his polemical Britain Independent of Commerce (1807) as a patriotic pamphlet to cheer British spirits during the French blockade of British trade - sufficiently successful with the public to merit four editions within a year.  The blockade, Spence sought to assert, was inconsequential largely because Britain's wealth rested ultimately on agriculture and not commerce.   To defend his point, Spence resurrected the analysis of the Physiocrats, boldly declaring that agriculture is the source of all wealth. However, Spence adds the addendum that manufacturing can ""assist"" productivity of land, be he insists that it is itself a ""sterile"" sector (i.e. cannot produce a surplus).  He uses Adam Smith's own arguments to ""prove"" that all taxes ultimately fall on land.  After all, Smith had said that taxes on profits will be shifted to consumers, while the wages of labor always adjust in proportion to the price of necessities.  However, while agreeing with the Physiocrats' tax-equivalence hypothesis (all taxes bear down on land rents), he stops short of advocating the ""Single Tax"". Spence derives an underconsumptionist argument (which he immediately associates with the Earl of Lauderdale), that the expenditure of Landlords is of utmost necessity to ensure that general gluts do not emerge.  ""Parsimony"", Spence argues, reduces ""consumption"" and thus the number of outlets for the profitable investment of capital, even while it increases the volume of capital in existence.  ""It is clear, then, that expenditure, not parsimony, is the province of the class of land proprietors, and that it is on the due performance of this duty, by the class in question, that the production of national wealth depends.  And not only does the production of national wealth depend upon the expenditure of the class of land proprietors, but, for the due increase of this wealth, and for the constantly progressive maintenance of the prosperity of the community, it is absolutely requisite, that this class should go on progressively increasing its expenditure."" (Spence, 1807: p.32-33). To this he adds resurrects a Mercantilist stance, applauding exports but calling to discourage foreign imports, because the primary consumers of imports are landowners and would thus be diverting their expenditures abroad. Spence's pamphlet and thesis was favorably reviewed by William Cobbett in his Political Register in late 1807.  Spence and Cobbett provoked replies from both James Mill (1808) and Robert Torrens (1808) and set the general glut controversy on track.  Mill blasts Spence for his assertion that manufacturing does not produce a surplus and for failing to recognize simple balance of trade logic. But Mill's principal complaint is for Spence's ambiguous use of the term ""consumption"", in which he confounds consumption for gratification (what Mill calls ""unproductive consumption"") with the setting aside of capital for future production (""productive consumption"" or ""employment""). Parsimony, Mill argues, doesn't reduce ""total consumption"", but merely transfers expenditures from one kind of ""consumption"" to another. And, Mill asserts, the growth of a nation depends on the latter kind, not the former. With this, Mill goes on to state his version of Say's Law (i.e. ""that a nation can never be naturally overstocked either with capital or commodities; as the very operation of capital makes a vent for its produce."" (Mill, 1808)). Spence replied with his Agriculture pamphlet, in which he starts out by distancing himself from the Physiocrats (whom Mill had lumped him with) and  minimizing his own differences with Mill.  But on the general glut, Spence stands his ground -- although it is not clear that he understood Mill's points.  There is a hint of insight, when he seems to suggest that capital expenditures are different from regular consumption since the former simultaneously increase total supply (thus creating persistent overproduction), whereas the latter do not.  But Spence messes the point up by stating that it is not so much ""excessive"" investment as a whole, but rather excessive investment in one sector (manufacturing) rather than another (agriculture), that is the problem.  Spence returned to economics in 1815 during the Corn Law debates, in order to defend them.  He goes on about how the recent high price of corn encouraged  increased investment into agriculture and should be maintained for England's prosperity.

Herbert Spencer, 1820-1903.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/spencer.htm," The Victorian biologist and early social philosopher Herbert Spencer was a great rival of Charles Darwin's. His theory of evolution preceded Darwin's own, but was soon overshadowed because of the absence of an effective theory of natural selection - although it was Spencer, and not Darwin, who popularized the term ""evolution"" itself and coined the now-ubiquitous phrase, ""survival of the fittest"". Although no longer influential in biology, his extension of his theory of evolution to psychology and sociology remains important.  His ""Social Darwinism"" was particularly influential on early evolutionary economists such as Thorstein Veblen, but, more contemporaneously, it was adopted with gusto by American apologists such as William Graham Sumner and Simon Nelson Patten. Spencer's own thinking was derived in part from the socio-philosophical counterpart of English Romanticist thought - perhaps best exemplified in the work of William Godwin, Thomas Malthus, Thomas Lamarck and von Baer. From the Romanticists, Spencer borrowed the concept of the interrelationship between an ""evolving"" aggregate and its constituent parts. As an aggregate history progresses, greater specialization and hence diversity is ""created"" by the Lamarckian adaptation of individual physical and behavioral characteristics to environmental circumstances. Thus, although diversity increases, not all diversity survives in that characteristics and habits that were poorly adapted to the circumstances will disappear. In Spencer's view, evolution is actually a progressive movement towards an ""equilibrium"" where individual beings change their characteristics and habits until they are perfectly adapted to circumstances and no more change is called for. Thus, Spencer's evolutionary mechanism is not only ultimately cumulant (i.e. it ends), but he also draped it in utilitarian teleological glitter, i.e. the idea that it is ""progressive"" in an ethical or moral sense - an adequately Victorian notion!

Arthur Spiethoff, 1873-1957.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/spiethoff.htm," A student of Gustav Schmoller, Arthur Spiethoff is one of the few members of the German Historical School to make a substantial impact on mainstream economics. This impact was in the field of business cycle theory. Spiethoff's theory of cycles (1902, 1903, 1923) built upon that of Tugan-Baranovsky's overinvestment theory and nudged the theory along by giving credit, the heart of the overinvestment theory, an endogenous character through innovation. Spiethoff's theory was later used with much profit by Schumpeter and Cassel. Spiethoff also participated in the Methodenstreit that pitted the German Historical School against the Austrian School. However, while at Bonn in the 1920s, Spiethoff crossed paths with Joseph Schumpeter and the two supposedly got on quite productively.  Although Spiethoff's famous ""economic styles"" argument was for a reconciliation between the theoretical and empirical methods, his heart was inevitably on the side of the German Historical School (1932, 1952, 1953).    Originating from Dusseldorf, Arthur August Caspar Spiethoff enrolled at the University of Berlin in 1893, studying economics under Adolph Wagner and Gustav von Schmoller. Graduating in 1899, Spiethoff stayed on in Berlin, assisting Schmoller in in the editing of Schmollers Jahrbuch (JGVV), and writing his doctorate thesis on business cycle theory (1905). His habilitation thesis was finished in 1907, and Spiethoff was subsequently appointed to the chair in political economy at University of Prague, succeeding Alfred Weber. In 1918, Spiethoff moved to the University of Bonn.  Spiethoff was joined by Schumpeter in 1925, and they worked alongside each other at Bonn.   Spiethoff is often credited for turning Schumpeter on to cycle research. Spiethoff is also sometimes credited as an independent inventor of  Aftalion's accelerator theory of investment. Initially supportive of the Nazi regime. Spiethoff remained at Bonn after 1933, until his retirement in 1939.

Oliver M.W. Sprague, 1873-1953,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sprague.htm,"  Moneary and business cycle theorist at Harvard Oliver Mitchell Wentworth Sprague was a Massachusetts native.  Sprague received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1897, under Charles Dunbar   In 1900, O.M.W. Sprague was appointed to the economics faculty at Harvard, to take up some of the work with the departure of the major figures of the department.  He quickly became T.N. Carver's right-hand man.  Sprague had a stint at the University of Tokyo between 1905 and 1908.  After returning to the United States in 1908, Sprague joined the faculty of the newly-founded Harvard Business School.  Sprague was thus a almost constantly at Harvard, from his beginnings until his retirement in 1941. O.M.W. Sprague made a name for himself as an expert on money and banking, writing an authoritative and highly influential  1910 book on the financial crises of 1873, 1883, 1893 and 1997, which helped pave the way for the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.. In the 1930s, Sprague was an frequent economic advisor, both for the US as well as foreign governments.  Sprague was an advisor to the Bank of England from 1930 to 1933 and the US Treasury in 1933.  A strong supporter of the Gold Standard, Sprague split with Frank Delano Roosevelt in 1933 over the departure from gold.  Among his more interesting contributions, Sprague tried to draw attention to the concept of ""financial fragility"" that was later taken up by Hyman Minsky.  In effect, Sprague argued that booms encourage the accumulation of debt, thereby making the economy quite vulnerable to small fluctuations in prices and interest rates that it might otherwise be able to absorb.  In his testimonies to Congress in the 1930s, Sprague pointed out that the wave of bank failures that precipitated the Great Depression was largely caused by the devastating impact of the fall in commodity prices on over-accumulated farm debt (taken out on highly-appreciated farm equipment during the boom years).   Although his earlier works had emphasized the importance of monetary factors in intensifying recessions, he did not regard them as causes by themselves. Sprague did not believe the Great Depression could be recovered by monetary policy alone, that there were more problematic underlying structural problems. Sprague went on to denounce other FDR policies of the New Deal, and argued strenuously that price and wage deflation were key.      Major Works of O.M.W. Sprague     Resources on  O.M.W.

Piero Sraffa, 1898-1983.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sraffa.htm," One of the economic giants of the century, Piero Sraffa was at the same time one of the sparest writers of economics - yet each one of his few pieces was tremendous in its turn. Sraffa's 1926 article on returns to scale and perfect competitions (a revised version of his 1925 Italian paper) highlighted a glaring inconsistency in the Marshallian theory of the firm.  As he concluded at the end of the famous 1930 Symposium on his work: ""I am trying to find what are the assumptions implicit in Marshall's theory; if Mr. Robertson regards them as extremely unreal, I sympathize with him. We seem to be agreed that the theory cannot be interpreted in a way which makes it logically self-consistent and, at the same time, reconciles it with the facts it sets out to explain. Mr. Robertson's remedy is to discard mathematics, and he suggests that my method is to discard the facts; perhaps I ought to have explained that, in the circumstances, I think it is Marshall's theory that should be discarded."" (Piero Sraffa, 1930, Economic Journal, March, p.93) This led to developments in two directions -- towards a theory of production in general equilibrium terms and, more daringly, the development of theory of imperfect competition by Joan Robinson (apparently Sraffa was the only male she respected -- and feared.) The shy, Italian-born Sraffa was brought by John Maynard Keynes to Cambridge in the 1920s. A close friend of the Italian revolutionary Antonio Gramsci, Sraffa has been sometimes considered a ""closet Marxian"" - and, apparently, he would sometimes be quite explicit about his loyalties - although the 1920s England was not exactly welcoming to Marxian radicals. Sraffa quickly became a fixture in the Cambridge world. He was part of the legendary ""cafeteria group"" with Frank Ramsey and Ludwig Wittgenstein which explored the 1921 probability treatise of J.M. Keynes. Sraffa ganged up with Keynes to bury Friedrich Hayek in the business cycle debates. Nonetheless, Sraffa's shyness in front of his students made lecturing a hellish experience.  Ever resourceful, Keynes arranged for Sraffa to be appointed as a librarian of King's College and, to keep him busy, got the Royal Society to hand over the task of editing a new collected edition of David Ricardo's works over to him.  Sraffa's painstaking and meticulous collecting and editing of Ricardo's works, begun in 1931, turned out to be a 20-year-task!    Although already in the printers in 1943, the edition  was delayed after the last-minute discovery of a trunk full of Ricardo's papers in Ireland.  Publication finally began (after Maurice Dobb got on board as assistant) in 1953.  It was a formidable edition.  As George Stigler was to put it later in his review, ""Ricardo was a fortunate man.. And now, 130 years after his death, he is as fortunate as ever : he has been befriended by Sraffa."" (Stigler, 1953).  Sraffa's introduction to the works was perhaps one of the most remarkable interpretations of the tenets of Classical and Neoclassical theory in the history of economic thought.  The outgrowth of these efforts was one of the longest-gestating works in economic theory.  Begun in the 1920s, Sraffa's Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities, a terse, hundred-page text which finally emerged in 1960. This book solved and restated Ricardo's theory for the moderns - inspiring the ""Classical Revival"" spearheaded by the Neo-Ricardians at Cambridge and elsewhere in the 1960s and 1970s. He was also the first to depict the famous ""reswitching"" problem in capital theory for an industry as well as an economy - which led to the Cambridge Capital Controversy and fuelled the Neo-Ricardian School. An interesting contribution of Sraffa was his relationship to philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein - who claimed that it was Sraffa who helped provide the important stepping stones for his Philosophical Investigations - arguably the most important philosophical work of the twentieth century. One last anecdote may be in order: in the 1930s or 1940s, Sraffa apparently came upon some money but he refused to invest until he found the ""one perfect"" investment. In 1945, after the bombs fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Sraffa put all his money in Japanese government bonds - not believing that the defeated Japan would stay lying in postwar rubble for long. Needless to say, Japanese bonds were going for a song. This radical economist made quite a fortune.       Major Works of Piero Sraffa     Resources on Piero Sraffa   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Heinrich von Stackelberg, 1905-1946.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/stackelberg.htm," Russian-born German economist, pioneer of oligopoly theory.  Stackelberg is most famous for his 1934 tract introducing a leader-follower strategic equilibrium modification in Cournot's model of duopoly.  Stackelberg's 1933 ZfN critique of Cassel raised the prospect of the indeterminacy of the Walrasian system, and became a focus of discussion in the Vienna Colloquium.

Heinrich Freiherr von Stackelberg was a Baltic German, born in Kudinovo (the environs of Moscow). The family fled Russia after the October Revolution, eventually making their way to Germany. The Stackelbergs eventually settled in Cologne. Stackelberg completed his secondary studies there and eventually enrolled at the University of Cologne, where he was introduced to economics and mathematics by E. von Beckerath. He was already lecturing at Cologne by 1928, completing his doctorate in 1930.  His habilitation in 1934 contained his famous duopoly model. He came into contact with the Austrian School during brief a sojourn to Vienna in the early 1930s.

By several accounts, Heinrich von Stackelberg was a convinced National Socialist, having participated in active Nazi student groups while at Cologne, joined the NSDAP in 1931 and after their arrival to power in 1933, Stackelberg promptly enlisted in the notorious SS. 

In 1935, Stackelberg was appointed professor at the University of Berlin, and founded the mathematical economics journal, Archivs für mathematische Wirtschafts- und Sozialforschung.  He would remain in Berlin for the next six years. In 1941, he moved to the University of Bonn.  But he did little teaching after this time, as Stackelberg was drafted into military service and spent long sojourns on the Russian front (mostly in an administrative capacity). Stackelberg's romance with the Nazis would apparently sour, and he gradually turned to the ""Freiburg School"" of Ordoliberalism (Eucken et al.).  His 1943 Grundzuge  was arguably the first German textbook containing modern Neoclassical theory.

In 1943, on leave from the Russian front, Stackelberg availed of a cultural exchange program became a visiting professor at the University of Madrid, Spain.  Stackelberg remained in Spain until his death in 1946.      Major works of Heinrich von Stackelberg     Resources of Heinrich von Stackelberg   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Hebert Stein, 1916-1999,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/schools/mandarin.htm#stein," The ""mandarins"" refers to economists in government service, whether as temporary advisors or career civil servants. From the very beginning of time, economists have served government and influenced policy-making.  Indeed, many of the earliest economists were precisely courtiers or bureaucrats writing on the affairs of their nation, espousing ideas about the doctrines and practices of government involvement in the economy, particularly active in the Mercantilist age, which they sometimes carried out themselves.   In the 19th Century and early 20th Century, the role of the economist in government diminished somewhat.  In the age of laissez-faire capitalism, government policy was passive and thus more simple. Government did not ask for high economic theorists for assistance -- they could do well enough with a mix of liberalism and crude apologism.  This did not mean that economists had no policy influence -- see the Bullionist Controversies and the debates on trade and you will find some of the greatest economists of the 19th Century involved.  But as economics became a more professional, academic discipline, economists became increasingly  happy enough to sit in the ivory tower, pursuing their theories to such a point of abstraction that direct translation into policy applications was neither obvious nor operational.  Of course,  there were a variety of wide-eyed socialist, syndicalist and populist movements urging for particular government policies, but they were not distinctly ""economists"" and not particularly successful anyhow. There were exceptions, of course.  In the German Historical School, the French Historical School and among the Fabian Socialists, there were influential economists who still saw a active role for government in the economy.  The state of affairs changed considerably between the 1920s and the 1950s.  World War I had destabilized the old 19th Century bourgeois liberal consensus and many looked to the State for direction. The post-1918 German and Austrian ""socialization"" experiments, the Bolshevik Revolution and the Five-Year Plans of Soviet Russia, the rise of Fascist corporatism in Western Europe, the Great Depression and the New Deal in the United States, the experience of  ""command"" economies during the World War II, the collapse of the Gold Standard and the search for a replacement, etc. had all helped put the economist back in the center of government policy-making.   However, even through all these changes, economic theory itself had little guidance to offer.  Most of what the policy economists recommended were practical measures which they came up with off-the-cuff.   The golden age for the ""Mandarin"" economist was doubtlessly the post-war period.  Perhaps the most critical event in the government-economist relationship was the publication of John Maynard Keynes's General Theory in 1936.  The Keynesian Revolution found a theoretical role for interventionist, discretionary government policy in the economy.   The new relationship was swiftly formalized  and governments enlisted legions of economists to help sort all this out.  Britain, France, Germany and much of the rest of Europe built up national accounts, set up welfare states, overhauled their fiscal codes, regulated or nationalized industries, coordinated trade unions and actively used their Treasuries and Central Banks for economy-wide stabilization policy.  In the United States, the New Deal merged into the Employment Act of 1946 and the setting up of the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA).  In Japan and, later on, in various East Asian nations, government took an even more active role, guiding capital and setting international trade policies that helped launch and guide their miraculous growth experiences.  Soviet planning was overhauled with the guidance of new techniques.  The emergence of newly independent  nations from the ashes of colonial empires, bent on development and not averse to planning, meant a whole new set of government clients for policy-oriented economists.  Multi-lateral government agencies, such as the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, hired another army of economists.   However, the economic disasters of the 1970s and early 1980s began to set the tide in reverse.  In the rising ""neo-liberal"" Reagan-Thatcher era, a new set of economists were needed -- particularly those that could justify the ""supply-side"" fiscal policies and Monetarist experiments of the conservative governments.  In the 1990s, with the wave of privatizations of state industries across the world and the collapse of socialist bloc, a whole generation of planning economists were made suddenly obsolete (albeit many reinvented themselves as ""transition"" specialists).  Central Banks, which have grown in importance in recent years, have remained perhaps the last bastion of government where economists and their opinions still matter. Many of the more important government economists during the post-war era were academic economists, temporarily on loan to governments.  However, there were many civil servants in their own right who achieved a degree of prominence and influence, not only in policy-making but also in more general economic thinking of the age.  The following list of ""mandarins"" includes some of the most famous policy-oriented economists -- both of  the academic and non-academic variety.

Lorenz von Stein, 1815-1890.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/lorenzstein.htm,"German economist, social historian and social scientist, long-time professor of economics at the University of Vienna. Lorenz Jacob Wasmer, Ritter von Stein was born in Eckenforde, Schleswig. He was educated in the schools of Flensberg.  In 1835, Lorenz von Stein went on to study philosophy and law at the universities of Kiel and later Jena.  In 1839, Stein moved to Copenhagen, taking up a civil service position in the Schleswig-Holstein office of the Danish government.  But he soon returned to his studies, obtaining his doctorate at the University of Berlin.  At the time, jurisprudence in Berlin was still in transition between the idealist school of late professor Hegel and the rising historical school of Savigny, and Lorenz von Stein absorbed both influences, and can be seen as a transitional figure of the German Historical School.. Lorenz von Stein lived in Paris in 1840-42, ostensibly researching the history of French law, but his interest was soon drawn to the rising French socialist movement. Lorenz von Stein consorted with socialist leaders and thinkers, like Étienne Cabet and Louis Blanc.  From this experience, Lorenz von Stein produced his classic 1842 book, one of the first systematic studies of French socialism. Lorenz von Stein presented himself as a detached, neutral observer, rather than an advocate. It proved a sensation, and was a revelation for Central European intellectuals, otherwise unfamiliar, or even unaware, of the new industrial working class and their political ambitions. It was highly influential on the young Karl Marx, and prompted him to move to Paris himself in 1843.. Stein followed this up with his monumental three-volume 1850 treatise on the history of French social movements. , and so is sometimes characterized as the father of German sociology.. Like Marx, Stein recognized that the industrial revolution and division of labor had set up conditions  In 1846, Lorenz von Stein obtained a position as extraordinary professor at the University of Kiel.  Stein opposed the Danish instrument of 1850 that integrated the duchies Schleswig-Holstein into the Kingdom of Denmark. As a result, Stein, and eight other professors at Kiel, were dismissed in 1852 by the Danish authorities. Unable to find another academic position for a while, Stein moved to Vienna, Austria, where he was picked up by the Austrian finance minister Bruck.  Lorenz von Stein was appointed Professor of Economics and Public Finance (""""Nationalökonomie und Finanzwissenschaft"") at the University of Vienna in 1855.  From his lectures at Kiel and Vienna, Lorenz von Stein produced a series of textbooks on political science (Staatswissenschaft, 1956), economics (Volkswirthschaft, 1858) and public finance (Finanzwissenschaft, 1860).  Stein also produced a massive seven-volume treatise (1865-68) and handbook (1870) on public administration (""Verwaltungslehre""), widely regarded as a fundamental work of German sociology,  at the intersection of Hegelian idealism and pragmatic statecraft.. Lorenz von Stein would continue teaching in Vienna down to his retirement in 1887, overlapping with the tenures of Albert Schäffle and Carl Menger.

Sir James D. Steuart, 1713-1780.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/steuart.htm,"  Scottish Enlightenment economist, often regarded as the ""last Mercantilist"".  A country gentleman, lawyer and Scottish nationalist, Sir James Denham Steuart of Coltness and Goodtrees (3rd Baronet) descended from a family of wealthy Edinburgh bankers and lawyers (the baronetcy title was purchased by his grandfather in 1695, notionally connected to Nova Scotia).  Steuart enrolled at the University of Edinburgh in 1724. Despite his father's death in 1727, Steuart carried on his law studies was admitted to the bar in 1734.  However, unlike his father and grandfather, who had been illustrious advocates, the young man had little appetite for a legal career - and did not get much of a chance to build one either, as he would end up spending half his life outside the country.   Like many rich young gentlemen, Steuart promptly set out in 1735 on a grand tour of Continental Europe which would last until 1740, passing through Holland, France, Spain and Italy,.  While in Rome, Steuart met Charles Edward Stewart (""Bonnie Prince Charlie""), the Young Pretender of the Stuart line to the British throne, and was promptly converted to the Jacobite cause.  He returned to Britain, got married in 1743, and awaited the call.  Finally, in 1745, Charles landed with his military force in Scotland, precipitating the ""Forty-Five"" Jacobite uprising. Upon Charlie's arrival in Edinburgh, Sir James Steuart was among the first to present himself to the prince and declare for him.  Steuart was promptly dispatched as an emissary to France on the prince's behalf, and charged with negotiating for a French invasion of England to support the rebellion. Steuart left in October and arrived in Versailles by early December.  Steuart was still in France when news arrived that the Jacobite army had been decisively defeated at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746.  Steuart was explicitly excluded from the 1747 oblivion act offering amnesty to the Jacobite rebels (20 George II c.52).  As a result, Steuart was unable to return to Britain and  would have to spend  the next couple of decades on the Continent.   Steuart set up his main residence in Angoulême, but was not particularly satisfied there and often went for long sojourns elsewhere. When the Seven Years' War broke out in 1756, Steuart, as a British national, felt uncomfortable in France and moved to Brussels (Austrian Netherlands, a neutral territory).  In 1757, he moved to Tübingen (Duchy of Württemberg, also neutral), where his son went to attend university.  Finding the Swabian climate disagreeable to his health, Steuart spent several interludes in Venice and Padua.  The Enlightenment was then bubbling up in France, and Steuart was soon engaged with the ""republic of letters"".  Steuart's first work, published in 1757,  was a defense of Newton's 1728 chronology from recent attacks by French clerical critics.  Steuart began researching economics at this time - publishing, as a side-effect, a small treatise on the coinage of the German principalities in 1761.  The change of regime that followed the death of George II and the ascension of George III in 1760 afforded Steuart the opportunity to try to find a way back home.  Steuart's son, also called James, went first, obtaining a position in the British dragoons.  Awaiting his own chance, Steuart moved north to Antwerp, and opened communications with the new British government. His strange activities alarmed the French authorities, who suspected he might be passing military intelligence to the British government, and he was briefly arrested and his home ransacked. After peace was made in 1763,  Steuart was finally allowed to return to Scotland, so long as he remained quietly on his estates (Steuart would receive a full pardon only in 1771). . It was at Coltness that Sir James Steuart completed his great economics treatise, Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy.  It had a long gestation.  Steuart had actually planned this work back in 1749 while at Angoulême, and began writing it in 1756.  The bulk of it was written in 1758-59 while in Tübingen.  When he arrived in Scotland in 1763, his Book IV (on credit) was still being researched.  The manuscript was finally completed by 1766, and published in 1767.  Along the way, in 1758-59, Steuart wrote his paper on the grain trade (published posthumously in 1783).    Sir James Steuart's 1767 Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy is perhaps the first, fully-fledged economics treatise. Although often regarded as part of the Scottish Enlightenment which produced David Hume and Adam Smith, Steuart's economics hark back to the earlier Mercantilist era.  More accurately, while on the Continent, Steuart had imbibed the sophisticated Enlightenment Mercantilism that was in the air -- particularly, German Neo-Cameralism -- which combined a legal-statist approach with a ""natural"" approach to economics.  Although a promoter of old fashioned export subsidies and import tariffs, Steuart added several elements that  tied this in with a more general theory of economic development.  Unlike the old Mercantilists, he recognized Cantillon's ""population-subsistence"" dynamics.  He also introduced the concept of diminishing returns to land.  Steuart juggled two interesting theories of price -- a long-run, quasi-Marxian labor theory of value and a short-run ""demand-and-supply"" theory.  Indeed, Steuart was among the first to introduce the term ""equilibrium"".  Thus, Steuart was an important forerunner of both the Classical and Neoclassical schools in many respects.  Steuart also provided one of the more able statements of the real bills doctrine of money. Steuart followed the Inquiry up with his 1769 Considerations on the county of Lanark (under pseudonym . ""Robert Frame""), where he explains and uses the mechanics of a supply-and-demand mechanism in markets. Adam Smith's (1776) attacks on Mercantilism were mainly directed against Steuart (even though the latter was not mentioned by name).  Steuart was translated into French in 1789-90, and used by the revolutionaries to argue for certain reforms.  However, Steuart's economics were lauded by Karl Marx and he became something of a darling to the German Historical School.   Steuart's 1767 Inquiry was not a best-seller - but it was well-received by critics, and was part of the reason he was finally granted a full pardon on December 23, 1771 (curiously, sixty years earlier, another Scottish outlaw, John Law, had also attempted a ""practical"" economic treatise in the hopes of earning himself a pardon - albeit Law did not succeed).  In 1772, at the request of the British East India Company, Steuart undertook a study on the scarcity of coinage in EIC-owned Bengal.  In 1773, Steuart added to his wealth the inheritance of the substantial lands of Goodtrees from a defunct Denham branch of the family, and changed his name to Steuart Denham as a condition. Steuart died on November 26, 1780, from a toe infection and was  buried in a family vault at Cambusnethan in Lanarkshire.  His fame, though tarnished by Smith, was still great enough for the dedication of a cenotaph memorial tablet to Steuart in Westminster Abbey (as far as I can tell, the only economist there).  His collected works were compiled by his son, Lt. James Stewart, in 1805.      Major Works of Sir James Steuart     Resources on Sir James Steuart All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Dugald Stewart, 1753-1828 .,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/stewart.htm," Scottish Enlightenment philosopher. Born in Edinburgh, Dugald Steward was the son of Matthew Stewart, a professor of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh.  Dugald studied mathematics at his father's university in Edinburgh, where he learned moral philosophy and economics from Adam Ferguson.  But of perhaps greater impact was one year (1771) Dugald spent at the University of Glasgow, where he came under the influence of Thomas Reid and Adam Smith. Dugald Stewart would go on to become a faithful promoter of their theories. Stewart's interest in moral philosophy and economics was initially put on hold, as he returned to Edinburgh in 1772 to take over his ailing father's mathematics classes.  Stewart was elected to the chair in mathematics in 1775, and continued to teach the subject for the next ten years.  But Dugald Stewart eventually went on to succeed Adam Ferguson in the Chair of Moral Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh in 1785.   Stewart would teach moral philosophy at Edinburgh until his retirement in 1809, and spent his ample remaining years putting out editions of his works on moral philosophy. Dugald Stewart's principal work is his  Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, which came out in three widely-spaced volumes over the course of his career (v.1 in 1792, v.2 in 1814 and v.3 in 1827). Dugald Stewart had a long and highly influential tenure as moral philosophy professor.  Stewart was possibly the first academic to teach a university course explicitly dedicated to political economy (in 1799-1800, lecture notes published posthumously in 1855-56). Among Dugald Stewart's notable students were utilitarian radicals like James Mill and Joseph Hume, the Edinburgh Review gang (Sydney Smith, Francis Jeffrey, Francis Horner, Henry Brougham, Macvey Napier), and several prominent liberal Whig politicians, like Henry Petty Fitzmaurice (Marquis of Lansdowne), Lord John Russell and Henry John Temple (Viscount Palmerston).  Dugald Stewart's principal follower, the philosopher Sir William Hamilton, put out an edition of his collected works in 1854-58. .

Joseph E. Stiglitz, 1942-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/stiglitz.htm," Incredibly prolific economist, currently at Columbia. Originating from Gary, Indiana, Joseph E. Stiglitz obtained his B.A. from Amherst college in 1964, and his Ph.D. from M.I.T. in 1967.  His subsequent career has been peripatetic.  After a period at Gaius & Gonville Cambridge and Cowles, Stiglitz joined the faculty at Yale University in 1970.  In 1974, he decamped across the country to take up a position at Stanford, before deciding to cross the ocean and take up the Drummond Chair at Oxford in 1976.  In 1979, he returned to the United States, to become professor of economics at Princeton, before leaving in 1988, once again for Stanford.  In 1993, Stiglitz was appointed to the Council of Economic Advisors under President Clinton, rising to chairman in 1995.  In 1997, Stiglitz moved across Washington to take a position as chief economist of the World Bank, until his resignation in 1999.  In 2001, Stiglitz finally seemed to settle down, taking a position at Columbia - not only in the economics department, but also its Graduate Business School and its School of International Public Affairs - where he has remained since. Stiglitz's has contributed all over the subject, but his most notable contributions are probably in uncertainty theory and, especially, information theory, making seminal contributions (with Rothschild) on increasing risk and adverse selection and (with Weiss) on credit rationing.  In macroeconomics, Stiglitz's is perhaps best known for work on efficiency wages (with Shapiro) and is sometimes classified as a New Keynesian.  Stiglitz has also contributed extensively to development theory,   public finance and international trade theory, always with an eye on risk and information problems and the unusual results that emerge.  Since the 1990s, Stiglitz has emerged as a prominent public intellectual in the American landscape, writing numerous books and articles for policy makers and the general public. Joseph Stiglitz won the Nobel Memorial Prize in 2001, alongside fellow information pioneers George Akerlof and Michael Spence.        Major Works of Joseph E. Stiglitz     Resources on Joseph E.

Henrich von Storch, 1766-1835,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/storch.htm," Russian classical economist. Heinrich Friedrich von Storch (usually known simply as Heinrich/Henri/Henry Storch, also known by his Russian patronymic as Andrei Karlovich Storch) was of Baltic German origin, born in Riga (Latvia), then part of the Russian empire.  Storch received part of his education abroad in Germany, at Jena and Heidelberg.  During that period, he undertook a tour of France, publishing his impressions in a travel book in 1787.  In 1788, Storch returned to Russia to become a teacher in fine arts at the Cadet College in St. Petersburg, and in 1790 was attached to the foreign ministry.  He was appointed to the Imperial Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg in 1796. In 1799,  Storch was appointed tutor of Tsar Paul I's children, the grand dukes Nicholas and Michael. An empiricist by inclination, Storch produced a monumental collection of historical statistics for the Russian empire (1797-1803).  But Storch's most famous work was probably his Cours d'économie politique, published in French in St. Petersburg in 1815, for the education of the Tsar's family.  Storch's Cours is essentially a re-statement of classical economics, much of it loosely paraphrased from Adam Smith and the French Liberal works of Comte Garnier and J.B. Say.  But parts of it were quite original - and some historians credit Storch with prescient notions of the concepts of comparative advantage, public goods, and social and human capital.   He also articulated a theory of stages of development, with different economic principles operative at different stages.. Storch's work elicited commentaries from Say and Rau for their French (1823) and German (1819) editions.   His memoirs for the academy, notably those on value in 1807-09, critique Smith's labor theory of value, and emphasize subjective value theory.  A proponent of free trade, Storch is credited (or accused) by some of persuading Tsar Alexander I to introduce measures to liberalize foreign trade between 1816 and 1819. The experiment did not go too well, and in 1821, the Tsarist government reversed course and returned to a protectionist stance.  Storch's tutorship of the future Tsar Nicholas I was apparently unsuccessful - despite Storch's attempt to instill liberal principles in the future autocrat, Nicholas seemed to discard them after ascending to the throne in 1825.

Benvenuto Stracca, 1509-1578.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/stracca.htm,"16th Century Italian jurist. Benvenuto Stracca (or Straccha), a jurist from Ancona, is often regarded as the father of commercial law, separate from civil or canon law.  Stracca's De Mercatura, was essentially a study of customary merchant practice which doubled as a handbook of commercial ethics.  His original treatuse focused on merchants and merchant contracts, practices and maritime rights, to which he soon added extensive discussions of bankruptcy (1553), factors and commissions (1558), third party transfers (1569), and insurance (1569), all published together from 1575 on.  Pedro Santerna's treatise on insurance was frequently appended in editions of Stracca's work. Although a stern moralist and archaically connected of Scholastic concepts of justice, and quite severe in the treatment of certain topics such as bankruptcy, by outlining what is or what is not ethical in a mercantile context, Stracca's work nonetheless opened the way for the acceptance of commerce as a whole as a legitimate and morally-acceptable activity.

Paul Streeten, 1917-,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/streeten.htm,"Austrian-born development economist.  Paul Streeten was born Paul Hornig (name was later changed), and raised in Vienna, to a notable Austrian family of Jewish extraction, extensively linked with the Viennese intelligentsia and radical politics. From a very early age, Hornig was involved in socialist youth movements.  Hornig enrolled at the University of Vienna, coming under the influence of Othmar Spann, but his studies were interrupted by the 1938 Anschluss.  The family managed to emigrate one by one.  Paul was the first to leave, making his way to England, where he was hosted for some time by the sisters Marjorie and Dorothy Streeten in Sussex.  In late 1938, Paul enrolled at the University of Aberdeen.  His studies were interrupted again in 1940, when he was detained by the British authorities as an enemy alien.  For the next year, he would proceed through a series of British internment camps, both in Britain and Canada.  Finally released, Paul volunteered for the British army and was assigned to an inter-allied commando unit, composed largely of foreigners from occupied countries  Advised to take up English names and cover-stories in case they were captured by the Germans, Paul Hornig became Paul Streeten.  Streeten's unit participated in the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943.  Mauled by shrapnel kicked up by an artillery shell, Streeten would spend much of 1943 in a hospital in Egypt.  He returned to Aberdeen in 1944, to pass his exam and collect his M.A. Unable to return to active service, Streeten enrolled at Balliol College, Oxford in late 1944, to study economics.  He came under the tutelage of and Thomas Balogh, Michal Kalecki, and others.  In 1948, Streeten was made lecturer and elected fellow of Balliol College, where he would remain attached for the next two decades.  He was drawn to development economics principally by the influence of Balogh and Myrdal. In 1964, Streeten (along with Seers) joined the newly-established Ministry of Overseas Development.  In 1966, Streeten joined the University of Sussex, where he would found the Institute for Development Studies and, in 1973, the journal World Development.  Streeten has also worked with several UN agencies, notably on the UNDP in the compilation of its Human Development Report.

Strumilin was one of the principal masterminds of the Soviet ""War Communism"" period of 1918-1921, proposing the use of ""labor units"" as a unit of account (to replace the worthless rouble).  Although most of his policies were abandoned after the introduction of the NEP in 1921, Strumilin remained on the State Planning Committee (Gosplan).    In later years, Strumilin concentrated his research on labor issues, in particular measuring the impact of education on wage differentials.

Franciso Suárez, 1548-1617.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/suarez.htm," Spanish Jesuit philosopher, originating from a New Christian family of Granada.  Franciso Suárez studied philosophy and theology at Salamanca.  Although not a promising student, he proved to be a late bloomer and went on to become one of the leading scholars of his time.  From 1597, Suarez taught at Coimbra, where he inherited the mantle and doctrines of Jesuit pathbreakers Pedro da Fonseca and Luis Molina. Suarez's principal works was in the abstract heights of late Scholastic metaphysics (his 1597 treatise being profoundly influential in its time).  But he also authored a couple of legal treatises (1612, 1613) that are more relevant.  Although hardly touching on economic matters, Suarez's 1612 legal treatise elaborated on the natural law theories of society and the human (rather than divine) origins of civil government that had been propounded by early Jesuits like Molina and de Mariana, and his reflections on natural and international law were given great credit by Grotius. However, given the suspicious reputation of the Jesuits at the time, Suarez rejects the regicidal implications of de Mariana's thesis, except under extreme circumstances.    Nonetheless, Suarez stokes up his own troubles in 1613 when, in the course of his attack on James I and the Anglican church, he condemns 'oaths of allegiance', a direct affront to the incipient rise of royal absolutism, that led to the condemnation and public burning of his work by civil authorities in London and Paris.

Johann Peter Süssmilch, 1707-1767,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sussmilch.htm," 18th Century Prussian cleric, state official and demographic statistician. Born in Zehlendorff, near Berlin, Prussia, the son of a brewer, in a pietistic evangelical Protestant family.  Johann Peter Süssmilch (or Süßmilch, or Suessmilch), was primarily raised by his grandfather, who arranged for his education.   At parental request, Süssmilch  give up his early aspirations to medicine, and enrolled at the University of Halle to study law in 1727, but went on to dabble in medicine and theology instead, continuing his studies at Jena.  Süssmilch became a Lutheran pastor, and his movement in pietistic circles gave him contacts that helped him access higher echelons.  He was appointed in 1736 as army chaplain, attached to the von Kalckstein regiment.  He also preached at the parish of Etzin.  Johan Peter Süssmilch is best known for his remarkable 1741 work on population, connecting  natural law and ""political arithmetic"".  Süssmilch sought to show the ""natural"" constancy of population patterns and classes over time (""God's order"", as the title of his 1741 work indicates).  His capable use of the ""law of large numbers"" in appraising demographic statistics has led him to be considered one of the fathers of statistics and econometrics.   Around the time of its publication, Süssmilch was accompanying the Prussian army in the First Silesian War.  On his return, in 1742, Süssmilch became the senior pastor (provost) at the parish of St. Peter-Cölln in Berlin. He became a member of the Royal Prussian Higher Consistory Counsel and was invited into the Prussian Academy of Sciences.  Never tiring of data, Süssmilch continued gathering more, and published ever-larger editions of his work in 1761-62 and 1775-76 (posthumous, edited by his nephew, Christian Baumann). Süssmilch's work was referenced extensively by Robert Malthus (1798).  He recognized not only the ""geometrical ratio"" of human fertility, but also the effect of higher standards of living on the population problem.

William Graham Sumner, 1840-1910,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sumner.htm," Influential and controversial arch-conservative economist and sociologist at Yale University. William Graham Sumner was born in New Jersey, to a modest family of English immigrants.  His father, a self-educated industrial machinist, moved to Connecticut shortly after. William Graham Sumner was educated in Hartford's public schools. Determined on a career in the Episcopal church, Sumner went on to enroll in Yale University, obtaining his  BA in 1863, and then spent the next few years abroad in Europe - in Geneva, Göttingen and Oxford - studying ancient languages, church history and biblical scholarship.  Sumner returned to the United States in 1866, and took a tutorship at  Yale, found his heavy teutonic brand of biblical scholarship was not really well-received.  Nonetheless, Sumner pressed on with a clerical career, and became a deacon in New Haven in 1867 and was ordained an episcopalian priest n 1869.  He served under another minister at the Calvary Church in New York, and in 1870, became a rector in Morristown, New Jersey. Throughout all this, William Graham Sumner nurtured an interest in economics, first awaked in high school, when he stumbled upon Harriet Martineau's book. This interest finally caught fire around 1870, when he came across the sociological works of the British evolutionary theorist, Herbert Spencer.  He decided to change his career, and in 1872, accepted an academic position at Yale College.  The choice of Sumner was forwarded by the conservative Yale authorities, who wanted a cleric of impeccable credentials to counterbalance the simultaneous appointment of the more liberal and empirical-minded Francis A. Walker that same year, to the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale.  Although Sumner was appointed to Yale College as a Professor of Greek and Ancient History in 1872, he began teaching economics and other social science subjects in 1876 Sumner was instrumental in reforming the American university system away from its old ""divinity-classics"" roots and towards modern subjects. For the next few years, Sumner and Walker maintained a rivalry over the soul of Yale economics, which sometimes veered into personal animosity.  Sumner's abrasive personality is believed to have driven Walker into eventually resigning from Yale in 1881.  Thoroughly wrapped in Spencer, Sumner was an outspoken Social Darwinist and leader of the American apologist school.  Sumner defended radical laissez-faire as being justified by laws of evolution (esp. 1883), and decried any and all State interference in markets, . Sumner was an ardent opponent of bimetallism, protectionism, socialism, imperialism, etc. Sumner's famous analysis of social norms are contained in his 1907 book. After Sumner's death in 1910, Albert Galloway Keller collected Sumner's essays and manuscripts in various books.

Paul M. Sweezy, 1910-2004,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/sweezy.htm,"American Neo-Marxist economist. Born to a New York, son of a prominent banker, Paul Marlor Sweezy was educated at Harvard.  After receiving his BA in 1932, Sweezy spent some time at the LSE and Vienna.  Returning to the US in 1933, Sweezy enrolled against at Harvard, and came under the tutelage and mentorship of Josef Schumpeter.  Sweezy obtained his Ph.D. in 1937, and stayed on at Harvard as a lecturer. Paul Sweezy is best known in economics for two not-so-distinct concerns which have dominated his economics: analyzing monopolistic competition and updating Marxian thought into ""Neo-Marxian"" economics.  His work on the former is best exemplified by his discovery of the ""kinked"" demand curve for oligopoly (1939) and his prize-winning study on the English coal industry (1938). Sweezy had first encountered  Marxian theory during his European sojourn.. In his majestic 1942 book, Theory of Capitalist Development, helped reintroduce Marxian thought to economics - in particular drawing attention to Marx's ""Transformation Problem"" and the theory of crisis. Sweezy subsequently translated Böhm-Bawerk's classic 1896 critique of Marx as well as Hilferding's response. In 1945, despite the support of Schumpeter and other faculty, Sweezy's appointment at Harvard was not renewed and Sweezy left academia.  In 1949, Sweezy co-founded the Monthly Review, as its subtitle indicates, an independent socialist magazine.  It would be the principal forum for radical economics and political thought for the next few decades, edited almost throughout by Sweezy.   It is unsurprising that Sweezy came within the sights of the American establishment at the height of the Cold War.  He was summoned and jailed for ""contempt"" by the McCarthyite New Hampshire legal establishment in 1953 - a conviction only overturned in 1957 by the US Supreme Court (see statement by Sweezy)). Sweezy became involved in an infamous debate with Maurice H. Dobb on the issue of the transition from feudalism to capitalism (e.g. 1976). Sweezy was also a proponent of an ""underconsumption"" interpretation of Marx, a new theory of imperialism rooted in ""dependency"" and the examination of Keynesian demand management as a life-valve for capitalism - ideas commonly associated with the Monthly Review, which Sweezy helped found in 1949 and which he edited for the rest of his career which was to be highly influential on the emerging ""New Left"". Sweezy saw these ideas as a way of modernising the Marxian theory of crisis and he set them forth both in his numerous writings in the Monthly Review and, perhaps most famously, in his highly influential Monopoly Capital (1966) written with Paul Baran.

Jonathan Swift, 1667-1745  ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/swift.htm," Famous Irish poet, pamphleteer, satirist and wit of Augustan Age.  Jonathan Swift was educated (more or less) at Trinity College, Dublin.  In the aftermath of the 1689 Jacobite rebellion in Ireland, Swift found shelter in England, under the auspices of Sir William Temple, a prominent diplomat and statesman.  Swift served as secretary to Temple for the next ten years.  In the process, Swift earned his M.A. at Oxford, was ordained into the Episcopalian Church of Ireland. He was charged with the tutorship of Temple's young ward, Esther Johnson, a.k.a. ""Stella"".   After Temple died in 1699, Swift moved back to Ireland, working at various posts in the Church.  In 1704, two satirical pieces -- Tale of the Tub and Battle of the Books -- earned him some renown (and some enemies).  Returning to England intermittently, he became intimate with the Augustan wits and literary men of the day -- Addison, Steele, Pope and Congreve. Although a long-time supporter of the Whigs, the growing chasm between Whigs and the established Church led Swift, in 1708, to launch a series of pamphlet attacks on the Whigs.   By 1710, Swift had switched over the Tories completely and put his skills at their disposal.  Swift took over The Examiner, a Tory rag, and, with a couple of 1711 pamphlets, helped turn to the tide of English public opinion against the ""Whig"" War of Spanish Succession. With the death of Queen Anne in 1714, the Tories fell from favor and Swift returned to Ireland.  He would serve as Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin for the rest of his life.  He remained bitter but relatively quiet for several years.   In 1720, Swift roused himself from his perch and got busy again. His 1720 Irish Manufacture essay attacked English economic policy towards Ireland and suggested a boycott of English goods.  The pamphlet was later declared seditious by the British government.  His Swearer's Bank (1720) was his proposition for the setting up a bank to help small tradesmen in Ireland. His visceral series of 1724-5 pamphlets, known as Drapier's Letters led to the downfall of Wood's half-pence, the Whig government's plan to make up for the shortfall of coinage in Ireland by minting copper coins.  His 1727 and 1728 pieces on the state of Ireland explains how British economic policies are keeping Ireland in a state of underdevelopment and poverty.  This series of works on the state of the Irish economy culminated in the wickedly delicious A Modest Proposal (1729).  His bitterness against British policy came out most fully in his Injured Lady (1746).  Oh, incidentally, he also found time to write that masterpiece of satire, Gulliver's Travels (1726). After the death of his beloved Stella, Swift began to drop off and gradually grew mentally unstable in the years before his death in 1745. Having served his role as an Irish patriot and Tory critic of Whig policies, Swift is duly celebrated in William Butler Yeats's poem ""The Seven Sages"" and in ""Swift's Epitaph"".

Edward Tatham, 1749-1844,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/tatham.htm,"Oxford divine and logician, commentator on public finances. Born in Sedberg, in theYorkshire Pennnines, son of a landed gentleman James Tatham. Edward Tatham was educated at a local grammar school, where he was given a thorough training in the classics by Rev. Wynne Bateman, proceeded to enroll in Queen's College Oxford in 1769. He graduated in 1774 and M.A. in 1776.  Tatham took up priestly orders in the Church of England in 1778 and was appointed to parish of Banbury, sufficiently nearby to allow him to maintain his residence at Oxford. In 1780, Tatham published his Twelve Discourses"" on divinity. In 1781 Tatham was elected fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford and became a popular tutor. In 1789, Tatham was selected to deliver the prestigious Bampton Lectures on theology at Oxford, choosing the topic of the congruity of logic and religion.  A two-volume expansion of the Bampton lectures were published as the Chart and Scale of Truth (1790-92; they were further expanded posthumously in 1840).   Here, Tatham sets out a common system of logic, which he identifies as emanating from the Divine mind, showing how it pervades all fields of science and inquiry. Delivered during the outbreak of the French Revolution, Tatham positions himself carefully as a champion of the Enlightenment, defending the rationalism of the 18th C., despite its suspicious association with the irreligious skepticism and the subversive revolutionary ideas of Hume, Paine and the French philosophes.  Tatham emphasized the congruity of scientific philosophy with received religion, and asserted that the established church and institutions of Britain had little to fear from rationalism per se, provided it is properly handled.  He encouraged the Oxford community to bring these topics into the university curriculum, to embrace and re-mould them in congruity with Christian principles, rather than exclude them and abdicate any influence over their development, leaving rational philosophy and the sciences in the hands of anti-religious figures, to be twisted and misused against the Church and State. Tatham's effort to reconcile scientific philosophy with received religion were praised by Thomas Reid.  The Chart and Scale made Tatham's reputation, and was arguably the most influential book on logic written in English before the appearance of Whately's Elements in 1823. As the French Revolution radicalized, Tatham, like many other British contemporaries, turned against it.  Tatham published two open letters decrying it - one directed against the radical English Revolution Society, and another in support of Edmund Burke, praising and reinforcing his recently-published Reflections in 1791. Later that same year, Tatham composed a sermon on the anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot.    In March 1792, Tatham was elected Rector of Lincoln College, replacing the late John Horner, and married in 1801.  Tatham dabbled on economic and public finance matters during the Pitt ministry of the 1790s.  Tatham's first open letter to Pitt (1795) connected the national public debt with rising British prosperity (""instead of national evil, but a national good"").  His second letter (1797) second letter argued for the establishment of a national bank to increase circulation and thus trade, were both very criticized.  Tatham would later credit himself (without modesty) as responsible for Pitt's introduction of an income tax in 1799.  Tatham was also an occasional commentator on the later Bullionist controversy, writing works on the scarcity of money (1816) and the metallic standard (1820)..  At Lincoln, Tatham continued to be a tireless advocate of curricular reform at Oxford, albeit not always seeing eye-to-eye with fellow reformers, like John Eveleigh and Edward Copleston at Oriel.  Tatham authored a series of addresses, from 1807 to 1811, collected in Oxonia Purgata (1811), protesting the reduction of the Oxford examination to Aristotlean logic at the expense of other disciplines.

Frank W. Taussig, 1859-1940.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/taussig.htm," Early professor of economics at  Harvard. Frank W. Taussig, was a student and later colleague of Charles Dunbar at Harvard.  He has come be regarded as the ""American Marshall"", not only for his affinity to the doctrines of Alfred Marshall, but also for his highly influential role in American economics.  Taussig's prime position at Harvard, his famous 1911 textbook and his control of the Quarterly Journal of Economics helped spread his version of  Neoclassicism throughout the United States.  Taussig was indisposed to the idea of a ""Marginalist Revolution"", stressing instead the congruity of Classical and Neoclassical economics. His 1896 attempt to resurrect the defunct ""wages-fund"" doctrine stands as an example of this.  Although sympathetic to some Austrian principles - notably Böhm-Bawerk's theory of capital -- Taussig was otherwise generally opposed to radical, high-theory Marginalism as well as American Institutionalism.  Most of Taussig's contributions to economics have been on international trade, particularly on the issue of tariffs, on which Taussig was the foremost authority for decades.  He was a lukewarm free-trader, but his anti-union and monometallist positions set him out as a relatively conservative economist. With brief interruptions (notably, to serve as advisor to Wilson's government in 1917-9), Taussig held his powerful Harvard pulpit 1885 until 1935, when that chair was handed over to his more colorful successor, Joseph Schumpeter.

Richard H. Tawney, 1880-1962.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/tawney.htm," Richard Henry Tawney was born in Calcutta, India, the son of a teacher and Sanskrit scholar.  R.H. Tawney was given an impeccable private education in England at Rugby school, and subsequently Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1903.  Like several Ballliol men (e.g. Beveridge, Cole), Tawney enrolled in the Christian Social Union and would became gradually drawn into more radical socialist politics.  R.H. Tawney took up residence at Toynbee Hall, the college's social work mission house in the London East End.  Tawney lived there for three years (alongside Beveridge), teaching adult education classes and became involved with the Workers Education Association (WEA).  In 1906, Tawney joined the Fabian Society and became a lecturer at the University of Glasgow.  But he happily gave that up in 1908 to give adult tutorial classes full time in a new experimental program had been set up by Oxford University and the WEA, in an attempt to give a university-style education to working class adults. Basing himself in Manchester from 1909 (same year he married Beveridge's sister), Tawney's WEA classes on economics and economic history were legendary.  It was during this period that Tawney produced his first major economic history treatise on the Agrarian Problem (1912). R.H. Tawney voluteered during World War I, foregoing an officer's commission to serve in the rank-and-file, and was badly wounded at the Battle of the Somme in 1916.  After the war, Tawney became more deeply involved in the Labour Party, and although he failed to win election to parliamentary seats (on several attempts), he served as a Labour policy advisor, especially on education. Tawney famously authored Labour's 1922 plank on general education.  In 1920, R.H. Tawney joined the faculty of the London School of Economics (LSE) and quickly became an academic superstar with at least three highly influential books: the Acquisitive Society (1920), a classic of radical literature, Religion and the Rise of Capitalism (1926), often conjoined to Max Weber's thesis, but with substantial differences, and Equality (1930), which would become a blueprint for Labour government activism after 1945.   Tawney was promoted to professor of economic history at the LSE in 1931.  Tawney was also helped found the Economic History Society in 1926, and became an editor of its journal, the Economic History Review.  Unlike earlier English historicists, R.H. Tawney did not see a conflict between economic theory and economic history or engage in methodological polemics over the soul of economics.  Although Tawney's opinion of economic theory was negative, he considered considered it largely irrelevant.  Tawney was critical in shifting economic history away from a branch of economics to become a thing in itself.      Major Works of R.H.

In 1879, F.M. Taylor became an ""odds-and-ends"" teacher at Albion College in Michigan. From 1884, while still keeping his Albion teaching job, Taylor began to study economics under Ely and Adams at Johns Hopkins. In 1887, Taylor transferred to the University of Michigan and received his Ph.D there. in 1888.  In 1892, Fred M. Taylor finally left Albion to take up a position and the University of Michigan. He was made full professor at Michigan in 1904. He retired to California in 1929. An early proponent of Marginalist theory, Fred M.  Taylor was involved in the Socialist Calculation debate, holding a position that would be later taken up by Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner.  This is most famously expressed in his 1928 Presidential Address to the A.E.A. Fred M. Taylor famously coined the term ""Say's Law"", crediting Jean-Baptiste Say in his 1907 Readings (p.101 ""We can increase our demand for goods only by increasing our production of goods"").  The phrase ""Say's Law"" makes its first appearance in print in Taylor's JPE article of 1909, and is expounded on repeatedly in his textbook Principles of Economics (1911 first edition, p.157 and made the chapter heading in the 1921 8th edition, p.196),       Major Works of Fred M.

Johannes Teutonicus, c.1170-1245.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/teutonicus.htm,"German Scholastic canonist of Bologna, the great glossator of canon law (ecclesastical law).

Johannes Teutonicus (""John the German""), whose real name was probably John Zemeke or Semeca, was born in or around Halberstadt, Saxony.  He moved to Italy to study law at Bologna under Azo, and went on to teach there.

In the 1210s, while teaching at Bologna, Johannes Teutonicus compiled his gloss on the Compilatio Tercia of Cardinal Petrus Collivacinus of Benevento (the papal decretals of the first part of the papacy of Innocent III).   In 1216, Johannes Teutonicus assembled an unofficial collection of decretals of the latter part of the papacy of Innocent III and the canons of the 1215 Fourth Lateran Council (later known as the Compilatio Quarta).  It is reported that he went to Rome to seek approval from Pope Innocent III himself to endorse this as an official compilation (like the Tertia), but it was a stormy encounter and the pope turned him down.. During this time, Johannes Teutonicus had also compiled his most celebrated work, the Apparatus or Glossa ordinaria. This was a magisterial collection of glosses on Gratian's Decretum by earlier writers, such as Huguccio, Laurentius and others, that had been scattered throughout different manuscripts. The Glossa Ordinaria, revised in 1245 by Bartholomew of Brescia, was immensely influential and covered many economic topics.  Endorsed by the university of Bologna, the Glossa was usually appended to copies of Gratian's Decretum and published together.  (the equivalent  task in civil law was conducted by his contemporary, Accursius)

Johannes Teutonicus moved back to Germany around 1218.  John Zemeke (believed to be be the same person) entered the monastery of St. Mary in Halberstadt, where he was made scholasticus (1220) then provost (1223) and then dean (1235).  He was subsequently made provost of the cathedral chapter of Halberstadt  in 1241, and died in 1245.

Walter Thom, 1770-1824,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/thom.htm," Scottish businessman, printer and journalist in Dublin. The facts of Walter Thom's life are scant.  Walter Thom was born in the burgh of Bervie in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.  He reportedly had a manufacturing business, but after it failed, moved to Aberdeen  to carve out a life as a writer, and, later on, Edinburgh and finally, in 1813, Thom moved to Dublin, Ireland. Upon arriving in Ireland 1813, Walter Thom set up a printing business and was editor of The Correspondent, a Dublin newspaper that largely supported the Tory government.  At the time, Sir Robert Peel was Chief-Secretary for Ireland and grew warmly toward Thom.  Nearing the end of his term, Peel arranged for the passage of  Dublin Journal  to the proprietorship of Walter Thom in July 1817  (orig. founded by George Faulkner in 1725, a friend of Swift's, the Dublin Journal had since become a government-subsidized paper).  Thom edited the Dublin Journal until his death in June,1824.  His son, Alexander Thom, who had come to Ireland around 1820 to assist his father's business, would take it over and expand it into one of the largest printing businesses in Ireland. It was Alexander Thom who was responsible for Thom's Irish Almanac, launched in 1844.  Walter Thom wrote several articles for David Brewster's Edinburgh Encyclopaedia (1807-30) and contributed to Sir John Sinclair's Statistical Account of Scotland (1791-99).  Walter Thom's best known work during his lifetime was a large History of Aberdeen (1812).  By virtue of the flyleaf of the History of Aberdeen and attribution in Sinclair, the HET website has chosen to identify Walter Thom as the anonymous author of the proto-marginalist 1809 tract, Sketches on Political Economy (a reply to James Mill).  This is backed up by the attribution in Sinclair, and in the 1809 review in The Tradesman (p.449).  The tract's author had been identified by Seligman (1903, p.338) as one of the ""Neglected British Economists"", but there had been no solid attribution to date (Goldsmiths'-Kress library has tentatively suggested Granville Sharpe instead, but without explanation (poss. Foxwell's attribution); Goldsmiths-Kress attribute the 1814 Synopsis to Thom.). Walter Thom, along with son, are buried in St. Luke's Church cemetery in Dublin.

"Benjamin Thompson, Count of Rumford", 1753-1814,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/rumford.htm,"American-born Enlightenment scientist, civil servant and social reformer, a forebearer of Malthus on Originally from Woburn, Massachusetts, Benjamin Thompson, descended from an old New England family.  His father died shortly after his birth, and he was apprenticed at a young age to a wholesale merchant in Salem, and later to a dry goods dealer in Boston.  While a teenage apprentice, Benjamin Thompson is reported to have been among the riotous crowd at the Boston Massacre in 1770.  He was released from his apprenticeship shortly after.  Interested from an early age in mechanics, he undertook a program of self-study in science, occasionally attending lectures at nearby Harvard college.  For a living, he tried his hand at teaching, and eventually wound up as a schoolteacher in Concord, New Hampshire (the town of Concord was originally called ""Rumford"", from where he would adopt the name of his later imperial title).  In 1772, the penniless young Thompson married a local wealthy widow Sarah Walker thirteen years his senior, and catapulted in social standing and comfort.  Through his wife's contacts, the ambitious nineteen-year-old Thompson was commissioned as an officer by the British colonial governor of New Hampshire, which earned the resentment (and suspicion) of other American officers. Benjamin Thompson became a loyalist during the American Revolutionary War which broke out in 1775.  He was evacuated from Boston in 1776 with the rest of the British garrison and made his way to England at the age of 23, leaving his wife behind.  Due to his intimate knowledge of New England, Benjamin Thompson was hired by the Sir George Germain, Secretary of State for Colonies.  He proved himself an able administrator, and rose quickly in colonial office ranks, reaching undersecretary of state.  During his time in London, Thompson also delved into military science, undertaking experimental inquiries into the efficiency of gunpowder, ballistic velocity and cannon bores.  He was elected a member of the Royal Society in 1779. At the dismissal of Germain and the dissolution of the Colonial Office in 1782, Thompson returned to the army as a cavalry officer with the rank of colonel, and was dispatched to America.  He helped reorganize the remains of the loyalist regiments in South Carolina, and then moved up to Long Island, New York to take charge of the loyalist dragoons.  But the loyalist cause was by then irretrievable, and Thompson did little more than stay put in Flushing, annoying the locals, for a year, before being evacuated again back to Britain.  Now 31, and still hungry for adventure, Thompson left England to serve as a soldier of fortune on the continent in September 1783.  He proceeded towards Vienna, hoping to volunteer for an imminent Austro-Turkish war.  The war, however, was not happening, so he found his way into service of the Elector Charles Theodore of Bavaria in 1784, who was promptly taken by his personality and ideas.  Benjamin Thompson would remain in Bavaria for the next eleven years in a variety of military and civil posts.  The Elector of Bavaria appointed Thompson his aide-de-camp, and then commander-in-chief of the Bavarian army and eventually minister of interior and still later prime minister of Bavaria.  Thompson would be invested as the imperial ""Count of Rumford"" (HRE title, ""Reichsgraf von Rumford"") in 1792, choosing the old name of his hometown in New Hampshire for his title. A scientifically-minded Enlightenment type and meticulous administrator, in the space of a decade, Benjamin Thompson (Count of Rumford) left an indelible imprint upon Bavaria in general, and Munich in particular.  Backed by the full confidence of the Elector, Benjamin Thompson-Rumford overhauled the Bavarian military, then decrepit and demoralized mess.  He established military academies, children's schools and military manufactories. To improve recruitment and morale, he raised soldier's pay, improved rations, established smaller garrisons nearer to soldiers' homes, with regimental gardens to focus idle soldiers' attention during off-hours.  Rumford also deployed the army's resources towards civic improvements, designed new model houses for the people  and laid out the suburbs of Munich in line with Enlightenment ideals, rationally arranged, letting in light and air, and with gardens for recreation and cultivation  (Rumford was arguably responsible for the introduction of potato cultivation in Bavaria as a staple).  Among his famous feats was the draining of the swampy lands in northeastern Munich to lay out a large public park, the ""Englischer garten"" (referring to him), one of the most splendid pleasure gardens in Europe.  Thompson-Rumford's more famous area were his social reforms, in particular handling pauperism, or as it is sometime put, ""clearing beggary"" from Bavaria.  Bavarian poor laws still operated on Medieval lines, reliant on the benevolence of the Catholic Church and the charity of alms-giving to the needy.  Thompson believed this had merely created a solid underclass of ""sturdy beggars"", particularly in Munich, who operated in a guild-like fashion, that seemed insurmountable and impervious to improvement.  Thompson-Rumford determined to overhaul the Bavarian poor system on a new rational basis and ""end"" intractable poverty.   On January 1, 1790, in his capacity as interior minister, Benjamin Thompson ordered the arrest of all the beggars of Munich. Within a week, some 2,600 beggars (or paupers suspected of begging) were rounded up (Munich then had a total population  of about 60,0000) .  The beggars were put to work in the ""House of Industry"", a new massive workhouse erected by Thompson-Rumford to manufacture military uniforms.  Jobs inside the House were arranged so that all types of people, including elderly and children, would have tasks suitable to their abilities. Work was paid (even if minimally), to restore an element of self-respect and pride in labor. This, Rumford believed, would break the cycle of poverty, institute new habits, and transition dependent paupers into self-sufficient wage laborers.  In this sense, Rumford was perhaps the first of a generation of Enlightenment thinkers who saw the existence of the poor not as an inevitability, a constant of the human history, part of the Divine order of society, but rather as a consequence of individual choices and habits.  Poverty was not ""with us always"", but a social problem that could be rationally solved. Thompson-Rumford, a micro-manager bent on rational efficiency, worked out the operation of the entire Bavarian poor system down to the last pfenning.  The provision of food to the inmates of his workhouses was a challenge of particular significance, and his solution - the soup kitchen - was perhaps his most famous contribution.  Since his youth,  Thompson had a deep interest in science, particularly the physics of heat.  From his early days in London, where he examined and experimented with the effects of heat of cannons, Thompson developed new theories about heat conductivity which would anticipate future thermodynamics.  While a military officer and civil servant in Bavaria, Thompson-Rumford was a member of various academies of sciences and found time to experiment and publish many scientific papers on the physics of heat.  But he also applied his knowledge practically to invent and develop new and more efficient ovens and ranges for warming and cooking.  He would later introduce improvements chimneys and furnaces.  The coffee percolator was another invention attributed to him. In social and economic history, Benjamin Thompson (Count of Rumofrd) is normally credited as the inventor of of the ""soup kitchen"".  Via his calculations, he had worked out that soup was the more efficient than bread to feed the inmates of his workhouses, and instituted industrial-scale soup kitchens using his new boilers.  Thompson-Rumford returned to Britain in 1795, and would thereafter divide his time between Munich and London.  Britain was then in the throes of the famous ""famine year"" of 1795, which led to a lot of renewed concern and rethinking about the English poor (Eden and Malthus would publish their studies shortly after).  Rumford leapt immediately into the fray of the British debate, and published his Essays, outlining his reforms of poor institutions in Bavaria, and promoting their application to Britain and other countries.  Rumford implemented the first soup kitchen in England at the Foundling Hospital in London on March 1796, using new ranges and boilers of his design.  However, Rumford still thought of soup kitchens in terms of feeding the inmates of a large institution.  But one of his more enthusiastic acolytes, the London police inspector Patrick Colquhoun, realized soup kitchens could also be used extra-murally, to feed the poor of entire neighborhoods (and indirectly control their behavior). Colquhoun spread Rumford's ""soup kitchen"" gospel to private charities which were raising money during the hunger years.  Colquhoun posited soup kitchens, rather than bread distribution, was the most efficient solution to feed the urban poor during the famine years, when wheat prices were high.  Soup kitchens for the urban poor, charging a penny a quart, were first set up in Spitalfields in 1797, and then subsequently spread to other towns in the kingdom. By the mechanism of selling tickets, the soup charities could personally screen those who applied, deny the ""undeserving"" and monitor the personal behavior of the remainder.  This, it was believed, would break the poor habits of the poor and eventually end poverty.    Thompson-Rumford's other great institutional invention was the establishment of the Royal Institution in London, arguably the first ""mechanics institute"" in Britain, in 1799 (it was preceded only by the Andersonian Institute in Glasgow).  Rumford designed it as a charity institution to deliver educational lecture series to the general public, particularly about new scientific principles in mechanics (physics) and chemistry.  Rumford's idea was to educate the more ambitious and clever members of the working class, giving them the scientific knowledge to make their own inventions and improve the machines they worked on.  The Royal Institution continues to this day. Having abandoned his first wife in America (who subsequently died), Benjamin Thompson re-married the widow of the chemist Antoine Lavoisier in 1802;   During his life, Thompson-Rumford gave bequests to the Royal Institution and Royal Society in London (establishing the Rumford medal there), as well as to institutions in his former homeland, such as the American Academy of Sciences in Boston.  At his death, his will endowed the Rumford chair in physics at Harvard, which was inaugurated in 1816.

T. Perronet Thompson, 1783-1869,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/perronet.htm," English soldier, pamphleteer and statesman. Originally from Hull, Yorkshire, Thomas Perronet Thompson was educated at Queen's College, Cambridge, graduating in 1802.  Perronet Thompson subsequently served in the royal navy, transferring to the army in 1806.  He was captured in a 1807 attack on Buenos Aires and briefly imprisoned.  In 1808, T. Perronet Thompson was appointed governor of Sierra Leone in 1808, but was recalled by 1810.  In 1812, he returned to the army, serving in Spain, and after the peace, in India.  He became a lieutenant colonel in 1829 and a colonel in 1846. Upon his return to England in 1822, Perronet Thompson delved into the political and economic debates of the day.  In 1826, in the course of a review of James Mill Essay, Perronet Thompson attempted to demolish the Ricardian theory of rent, regarding it as a faulty and useless appendage of classical theory.  He followed this up with his highly popular Catechism on the Corn Laws (1827), which was reprinted numerous times by the Anti-Corn Law League. In 1828, Thompson became a proprietor of the Westminster Review, the fledgling Benthamite journal, and contributed numerous articles to it.  He joined the Political Economy Club soon after. Perronet Thompson stood for parliament, representing Hull in 1835.

Henry Thornton,1760-1815.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/thornton.htm," English banker, politician, philanthropist and and pioneering monetary economist. An opponent of the Real Bills doctrine, later an eloquent defender of the Bullionist position and a fundamental figure in monetary theory. His process of monetary expansion anticipates Knut Wicksell's theory of the ""cumulative process which restates the Quantity Theory in a theoretically coherent form. He is also sometimes characterized as proto-marginalist. Henry Thornton was the third and youngest son of John Thornton, a wealthy London merchant engaged in the Russia trade.  The Thorntons originally hailed from Hull, Yorkshire.  Henry's grandfather, Robert Thornton, and his brother Godfrey, had moved to London in the early 18th C. to enter the Baltic and Russia trade.  They both had made fortunes and become Bank of England directors.  Robert settled  the family in Clapham. In the 1750s, a local Clapham curate Henry Venn (grandfather of the mathematician) converted Robert's son, John Thornton, to the Wesleyan wing of the Anglican Church.   John Thornton's Methodist leanings and munificence towards evangelical causes and charities of multiple stripes would have a profound influence on his son Henry.    Henry formed an early attachment with his cousin William Wilberforce (who grew up partly in the Thornton home) and the two would later go on to form the core of  the ""Clapham Sect"" of Christian social reformers. Perhaps reflective of his parents' unorthodoxy, Henry's education had been a little spotty - after eight years of solid education at Wandsworth, Henry was transferred at the age of thirteen to a rather more experimental school run single-handedly by a certain Mr. Roberts in Point Pleasant. Henry would later characterize it as an underwhelming experience, that he received ""next to no education"".     In 1778, at the age of eighteen, Henry was apprenticed in the counting house of his relative Godfrey Thornton (son of the elder Godfrey), and in 1780 moved into his own father's trading firm, Thornton, Cornhill & Co.  Finding his father's trading practices rather nebulous and speculative, Henry Thornton gave up the merchant's life and, over his parents' objections, pursued a more reliable banking career.  He joined the banking house of Down and Free on Bartholomew Lane in 1784, where he would soon make partner (becoming Down, Thornton and Free).  He would remain with this bank for the remainder of his life. Parallel to his banking activities, Thornton also launched into a political career.   In 1780, at his mother's urging, Thornton stood for a seat in Hull, but pulled out when he realized he was expected to bribe voters.  He ran again in 1782 in Southwark, London, and won. Although a populous borough, Henry Thornton managed to remain M.P. for Southwark until the end of his life, three decades later, winning eight straight contested elections.  Henry later recalled his first vote in parliament was for peace with America. In parliament, Henry Thornton charted an independent liberal course, fluctuating between Fox's Whigs and Pitt's Tory faction (Wilberforce, also an MP, was more loyally attached to Pitt).  In 1792, after his father's death, Henry Thornton bought an estate on Battersea Rise, Clapham, and leased one of its houses to Wilberforce.  Another tenant was Edward James Eliot, the brother-in-law of Pitt (it is reported that Pitt spent many a sojourn there himself).  The Clapham Sect, or ""party of saints"" (as it was derisively called) began to take shape there, in the living rooms of Thornton and Wilberforce.  Thornton was the leading supporter of Wilberforce's anti-slave trade agitation, from its beginnings in 1787 to its culmination in 1807.  Thornton himself was a founder and chairman of the Sierra Leone Company, that established a colony for freed slaves in West Africa in 1787.  Lending his financial expertise, Thornton served as treasurer for a variety of other Clapham-related schemes, such as the Society for Missions to Africa and the East (f. 1799), the British and Foreign Bible Society (f.1804), the African Institution (f.1807) Thornton's parliamentary voting record in the 1790s finds him repeatedly in support of peace with the French Republic, in favor of parliamentary reform, Catholic emancipation and Pitt's income tax.  He carved out a reputation in parliament as an expert in financial matters.  Thornton's greatest performance was doubtlessly his 1802 Enquiry on Paper Credit, his seminal contribution to the Bullionist controversy.  Parliament had suspended convertibility of Bank of England banknotes to gold in 1797.  In 1801, Walter Boyd sensationally blamed a recent bout of inflation and a decline in the exchange rate for the pound on excessive note issue by an unanchored Bank of England.  Henry's older brother, Samuel Thornton, was the governor of the Bank of England at the time, and Henry may have felt a fraternal obligation to defend the Bank's honor.  Thornton wrote his Enquiry in response to Boyd, showing that while Boyd's theoretical point had merit, it did not translated into facts in this case as there was no excess issue.  The  inflation and the depreciation of the paper pound was due primarily to war-related payments abroad, failed harvests and wartime difficulties in the importation of corn. Francis Horner favorably reviewed Thornton's treatise in the very first issue of the Edinburgh Review, helping popularize its thesis.  Thornton's views seemed vindicated when the pound subsequently rose in the aftermath of the peace of Amiens. It was not in the facts he outlined, but in the construction of monetary theory that Thornton's contribution is usually celebrated.  He debunked the Real Bills doctrine, and upheld the Quantity Theory of money, albeit more thoroughly and carefully than his predecessors. Thornton explained the process of monetary expansion in detail, how it worked through the banking sector, and business borrowing, and affected the economy. In many ways, Thornton  anticipates Knut Wicksell's theory of the ""cumulative process"", which restates the Quantity Theory in a theoretically coherent form. As his work makes dexterous use of supply-and-demand arguments, Thornton is also sometimes characterized as a proto-marginalist. A  few years later, Henry Thornton, along with Horner, was appointed to the 1810 Bullion Committee, to address the matter of resumption again, which had been revived by Ricardo.  Thornton had a hand in the writing of the committee's report, and this time he retreated from his prior anti-bullionist position and recommended resumption of convertibility, albeit warning that it should be done at the depreciated rate, to avoid deflationary effects on the economy.

William Thomas Thornton, 1813-1880,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/wthornton.htm,"William Thomas Thornton was a British maverick economist and EIC bureaucrat. Originating from Burnham, Buckinghamshire, William T. Thornton was educated at the Moravian school in Ockbrook.  After spending a few years in Malta and Constantinople, Thornton became an East India Company employee - entering as a clerk in 1836.  After the EIC was nationalized in 1858, Thornton stayed on as secretary of public works in the India Office until his retirement.  Although classified here as an anti-Classical economist, W.T. Thonrton was nonetheless a member of the Ricardian Political Economy Club and a good friend of John Stuart Mill.  Thornton worked alongside Mill in the India Office almost every day from 1846 to 1858, and was one of the latter's few intimates. Thornton's 1845 assault on Malthus's population theory, or rather his belief that it could be overcome by small property-ownership among the poor, was well-received.  Albeit his 1848 Plea for land reforms in Ireland fell upon deaf ears. In a series of articles in the Fortnightly Review (1866-68) culminating in his famous 1869 book, On Labour, William Thornton launched his famous assault on the ""supply-and-demand"" theory of market price, arguing that the implied ""mechanism"" was faulty and that price was indeterminate.  Thornton has been hailed in the modern day as the first economist to pay serious attention to stability theory and market microstructure.  His argument led to energetic responses by J.S. Mill, J.E. Cairnes, Thomas E. Cliffe-Leslie and W.S. Jevons.  Fleeming Jenkin's diagrammatic depiction of supply and demand curves was constructed to refute Thornton.   In that same book, Thornton led an assault on the Ricardian wages fund doctrine.  In his 1869 response, J.S. Mill recanted the doctrine.        Major Works of William T.

Johann Heinrich von Thünen, 1780-1850.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/thunen.htm,"  North German landowner from the Mecklenberg area. Although educated at Göttingen, he spent most of his life managing his rural estate, Tellow.  In the first volume of his treatise, The Isolated State (1826), he laid down the first serious treatment of spatial economics, connecting with the theory of rent.  His second volume (1850) developed the essence of the marginal productivity theory of distribution in a mathematically precise way, thereby making one of the most important Proto-Marginalists of the era. Nearing his death, he asked that his famous equation for the marginal product of labor, or natural wage (w =Ö ap),  be carved into his tombstone.

Jan Tinbergen, 1903-1994.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/tinbergen.htm," Dutch economist, statistician and pioneer of econometrics. Originating from the Hague, Jan Tinbergen obtained his doctorate at the University of Leyden in 1929.  Tinbergen joined the Dutch central statistical bureau in 1929. From 1933, Tinbergen also became a part-time faculty member at the Netherlands School of Economics (now Erasmus University, Rotterdam).  In 1936-38, Tinbergen took leave to work as an advisor to the League of Nations in Geneva, during which composed some of his most famous works. Tinbergen pioneered econometrics in the late 1930s, applying new statistical techniques mainly to Neo-Keynesian macroeconomic models, estimating parameters and using it as a means to calculate the impact of economic policies.   Tinbergen's 1936 model of 34 equations for the Dutch economy was the first macroeconometric model ever built.  His 1939 macro-model of the United States used 48 equations (Klein's 1950 model would use only seven). In 1945, Tinbergen became the director of the Dutch Central Planning Bureau in the Hague.  He resigned in 1955 to take up a full-time academic position at Rotterdam, although still acting as a consultant to the Dutch government, various developing countries (India, Pakistan, etc.) and UN agencies.  In the 1950s, Tinbergen laid the groundwork for the theory of optimal policy and also extended his ideas to longer-term problems, notably economic development and growth. Jan Tinbergen shared the first  Nobel Memorial Prize  in 1969 with Ragnar Frisch.      Major works of Jan Tinbergen     Resources on Jan Tinbergen All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Gerhard Tintner, 1907-1983,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/tintner.htm,"Austrian statistician and economist. Born in Nuremberg, Germany to Austrian parents, Gerhard Emil Tintner studied at the University of Vienna, then a citadel of the Austrian School, obtaining his degree in 1929.  After a brief period at the LSE.in 1930, Tintner worked under Morgenstern at the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research.  Tintner organized a reading group at the Institute to examine J.M. Keynes's General Theory as soon as it came out in early 1936.  However, the situation in Austria was increasingly precarious, and Tintner decided to leave later that year.   He emigrated to the United States, joining the the Cowles Commission as a research fellow in Colorado Springs in 1936-37. He would help arrange a similar fellowship for fellow-Viennese Abraham Wald to come the next year. Gerhard Tintner subsequently took a more permanent position at Iowa State College in late 1937, where he would remain until 1962.  During this period, Tintner made substantial contributions to econometrics and time series.      Major Works of Gerhard Tintner     Resources on  Gerhard Tintner   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

James Tobin, 1918-2002,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/tobin.htm," Prominent Keynesian macroeconomist and monetary theorist at Yale. Born and raised in Champaign, Illinois, James Tobin received his principal degrees from Harvard (B.A., 1939, M.A. 1940, Ph.D., 1946), where he came under the influence of Alvin Hansen, Seymour E. Harris and Joseph Schumpeter.  While still an undergraduate, Tobin read the ""new"" book causing so much of a stir in England: John Maynard Keynes's General Theory, and was promptly hooked. Tobin's senior thesis emerged as a paper in the QJE, where he analyzed the conditions for the ""Keynes Effect"" of money wage flexibility, unearthing its implicit assumptions about factor substitutability.   Tobin interrupted his studies from 1942 to 1946, when he served with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific (the character, ""Tobit"", in Heman Wouk's novel, The Caine Mutiny, was based on him).  Upon his return, he finished his Ph.D. In his 1947 paper, Tobin resurrected the money wage question.  He focused on outlining the cases where the Keynes Effect might not work -- e.g. the ""liquidity trap"", zero interest-elasticity of investment, etc. In 1950, James Tobin joined the faculty at Yale University, where he would remain until his retirement in 1988.  Tobin was director of the Cowles Foundation from its move to Yale in 1955 until 1965  Tobin took leave in 1961 to serve on John F.

Francisco de Toledo, 1532-1596.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/toledo.htm," 16th Century Spanish. Jesuit theologian and philosopher at Salamanca. Francisco de Toledo studied under Domingo de Soto at the Dominican bastion of  Salamanca.  The precocious Toledo taught philosophy at Salamanca in the 1550s before joining the Jesuit Order in 1558.  He subsequently became a professor at the pontifical Collegio Romano, where he carved a reputation as a leading scholar of Aristotle, papal counselor and the Jesuit Order's principal contact in Rome. Toledo was the first Jesuit to be appointed Cardinal. Toledo famously led the independent 1571 Jesuit commission that spearheaded the easement of the Catholic ban on usury.  In response to a series of papal bulls (1569, 1573, 1586) condemning conventional dodges (e.g. triple contracts) and new instruments (e.g. annuities, bills of exchange) that seem to violate the ban on usury, Toledo (often in consultation with his former Salamanca colleague Navarrus) delivered interpretations (e.g. 1573, 1599), partly scholastic, partly based on natural law, that rendered them toothless and legitimized the practices.

Thomas Tooke, 1774-1858.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/tooke.htm," Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, son of the chaplain of the English factory of that city.  After a brief education, Tooke became involved as a merchant in the Russia trade.  During the depths of an economic depression of 1820,  Thomas Tooke drafted and organized the famous London Merchants' Petition, signed by numerous London merchants, bankers and classical economists.   It was presented to parliament on May 8, 1820 under the sponsorship of Alexander Baring, MP.  The petition called for the repeal of the Corn Laws and other protectionist restrictions, as harmful to British industry.  The petition notably rejects the doctrine of reciprocity, the use of trade barriers as diplomatic negotiating tokens, and notes that trade barriers are injurious to Britain, regardless of what foreign countries do (""our restrictions would not be the less prejudicial to our own capital and industry, because other Government persisted in preserving impolitic regulations"").   Tooke's petition is normally credited as kicking off the British free-trade movement,  Tooke subsequently became the leading organizer of the Political Economy Club of London, founded in 1821.   In the 1820s, Tooke emerged as the leading figure of the English ""Banking School"" during the Bullionist Controversy.  He rejected the Quantity Theory without actually developed a clear monetary theory of his own. Tooke is particularly renowned for the magnificent compilation of economic statistics, esp. the corn prices, in his monumental six-volume History of Prices (1838 to 1857, last two volumes edited with William Newmarch) Upon his death, a public subscription by his friends and admirers led to the creation of the Tooke Professorship of Economic Sciences and Statistics at King's College, London.

Col. Robert Torrens, 1780-1864.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/torrens.htm," Prominent (but critical) Classical economist. Irish-born Robert Torrens joined the Royal Marines as an ensign in 1796.  Torrens was on active duty in England until 1810, when he was placed in command of a marine battalion on the recently-conquered Anholt island in the Kattegat.  In 1811, Torrens led the celebrated repulsion of a more numerous Danish invasion force on Anholt island, and was wounded in the process. He retired as lieutenant colonel in Woolwich on half-pay in 1823 (briefly restored to full pay in 1830-34, whereafter he sold his commission).  The Anholt action aside, Torrens military duties could not have been too strenuous, for he found himself involved in numerous other activities.  While still in active service, he published his first economic pamphlet, The Economist Refuted (1808), a riposte to William Spence.  Around this time, Torrens devoured the works of Adam Smith and would take on several of the latter's characteristic theories, notably the real bills doctrine. In 1812, he published his Essay on Money and Paper Currency, setting himself as the leader of the Anti-Bullionists during the Bullionist Debate of the 1810s. In February 1815, while the Corn Laws debate was at its height, Robert Torrens published his Essay on the External Corn Trade (1815).  The impetus of the piece was to respond to Malthus's support of the restrictions.  Its preface is mean-spirited in tone:""Mr Malthus scarcely ever embraced a principle, which he did not subsequently abandon."" (p.ix), Torrens famously noted, before proceeding to accuse him of plagiarizing his population doctrine from Robert Wallace.  In the Essay, Torrens lays out his what is in effect his independent discovery of the Ricardian differential theory of rent - although not as complete as the simultaneous pieces by Ricardo's or West's (Torrens noticeable misses out on the intensive margin).

[It is frequently alleged that Torrens (1815) also articulated (before Ricardo!)  the theory of ""comparative advantage"" in international trade. The allegation rests on a single passage (or rather, single phrase, ""even though they should be superior"", on p.264), but it otherwise seems he is working through the bulk of the essay with absolute advantage.  In later editions of the Essay, Torrens would congratulate himself for this discovery (e.g.1829: p.vii), but later acknowledge himself indebted to Ricardo for it (e.g. 1844: p. 332).  We ought also to note that, policy-wise, Torrens was not a believer in unilateral free trade; he saw the expediency of reciprocal tariffs.]

Torrens's activities put him in personal contact with David Ricardo, and the two men are known to have visited each other and dined together. Around 1818, Torrens acquired The Traveller, a sleepy trade journal for commercial travellers, which Torrens would quickly turn into a leading and influential newspaper. General editorship was placed in the hands of the Benthamite Walter Coulson, but Torrens retained the political economy section for himself. [the young J.S. Mill's first appearance in print was in The Traveller in December 1922, a response to Torrens on the meaning of ""exchangeable value""]. In 1823, Torrens acquired The Globe and fused the papers under the latter title. Over the next few years, Torrens went on to purchase five more papers: The Statesman, The True Briton, The Nation, The Evening Chronicle, and The Argus. Under Coulson's successor, Gibbons Merle, the Globe became more stridently Whig and a mouthpiece for the reformist liberal faction of Lord John Russell.  It was only after Torrens death in the 1860s that the Globe gradually abandoned its strident liberalism and became a bastion of cautious conservatism. Although generally regarded as a member of the Ricardian school, Torrens remained a consistent critic of the ""labor theory of value"" (e.g. 1818), and later, after Senior's critique of 1829, recanted the Malthusian population doctrine    Torrens joined the side of the Currency School in the Banking-Currency School Debate of the 1840s.  Torrens served on the colonization committee of South Australia. The Torrens river in Australia is named after him.

Antoine-Louis-Claude Destutt de Tracy, 1754-1836.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/tracy.htm," The liberal French nobleman Destutt de Tracy was one the leading idéologues that sought to extend Enlightenment liberalism to post-Revolutionary France. He was, together with Say, the founder of the French Liberal School.   Destutt de Tracy's main work was the series Eléments d'idéologie (1801-1815) which followed up on the philosophy, psychology and economics of Condillac.  Like Condillac, Destutt de Tracy  sought to ground value in psychology, particularly utility.  He explicitly repudiated Adam Smith's cost theory of value (although he was sympathetic with much of the rest of his analysis).  Tracy's insistence that value must be measured in invariable units inspired Ricardo's search.  Destutt de Tracy's support for laissez-faire doctrines invoked the wrath of Napoleon Bonaparte.  Prevented from printing his Commentaires in 1806, Destutt de Tracy had to resort to asking the American president, Thomas Jefferson, to publish an English language version.  It was only published in France in 1819.  Jefferson also supervised the translation of Tracy's main economics treatise, the Traité de la volonté (Vol. 4 of the Eléments) into English in 1818, under the title Treatise on Political Economy.  It was reprinted in French in 1823 as Traité d'économie politique.  It was Tracy who originally coined the term ""ideology"", but he used it to denote the ""science of ideas"" in the sensorialist sense.  The term was given its negative slant by Napoleon and, later, Marx and Engels.      Major Works of A.L.C. Destutt de Tracy      Resources on A.L.C. Destutt de Tracy   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

George Tucker, 1775-1861,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/georgetucker.htm,"Virginia lawyer, politician, novelist, historian, first professor of moral philosophy at the University of Virginia and early American economist. George Tucker was born and raised in Bermuda, the son of prominent British West Indian merchant family. After his mother's death in 1795, young George Tucker was sent by his father to the United States, with intention on pursuing a legal career under the tutelage of his cousin (sometimes characterized as an uncle),  the notable jurist St George Tucker, then a professor of law at William & Mary in Virginia.  But the lures of American high society got the better of him.  After a period of wild youth as a man-about-town in Philadelphia, the broke young George finally came to his cousin's door in Williamsburg.  George Tucker enrolled in the College of William & Mary, obtaining his degree in law in 1797 and married a local socialite. Tucker's dissolute life tempered a bit, but did not settle down. Upon his wife's death in 1799, Tucker spent some time shuttling between Virginia and the West Indies, to secure his late wife's estate. Eventually, Tucker returned in 1800 and settled into a law practice in Richmond, Virginia by 1801. That same year, after Gabriel's ""slave conspiracy"" had raised alarms among Virginian plantation owners, Tucker published a pamphlet proposing to re-settle free Blacks far away, somewhere west of the Mississippi River, where they could not influence their enslaved brethren.  Tucker remarried in 1802, nonetheless his extravagant lifestyle continued while the income from his law practice, only ineptly followed, could hardly cover his expenses. Hoping for a quick and easy fortune, Tucker tried his hand at dubious investment schemes, blowing not only his family's savings, but that of several other persons, resulting in a series of court cases and investigations for embezzlement and other financial improprieties (most notably a lottery scandal in 1803).  His cousin, St. George Tucker, had to repeatedly intervene to bail him out of trouble, both legal and financial.  Drummed out of Richmond society in 1806, Tucker moved onto a relative's property in rural Shenandoah valley.  In 1808, Tucker set up a plantation in Pittsylvania, including slaves (despite his moral opposition to slavery), in an effort to start a new life as a country lawyer.  But it bored him, and George Tucker entertained himself by writing, putting out a few pamphlets on a variety of issues, of local and national interest.  A series of letters on navigation on the Roanaoke River and a canal scheme brought him attention, and Tucker was encouraged to enter politics directly. Despite his early allegiance as a Jeffersonian Republican-Democrat, Tucker flipped over to the Federalists, and was elected to the Virginia Assembly in 1819, and then to the US Congress in 1823.  But he did not stay there for long. Tucker's political career was hampered by a rapid series of misfortunes.  Tucker suffered financial setbacks, the loss of his Pittsylvania plantation to public auction, the death of two of his children, the confinement of a third to a mental institution, and finally the death of his second wife in 1823.  Hoping for some pennies from royalties, Tucker put out his Essays in 1822, and followed it up with a long novel, Valley of the Shenadoah.  The latter, published in 1824, it is one of the earliest examples of the genre of Southern epic romances. It describes the decline and fall of an aristocratic plantation family to the machinations of hard-hearted bourgeois merchants. He would put out a second novel, Voyage to the Moon, a Swift-like science fiction satire in 1827.  Tucker married for a third time in 1828. Although the novels were not financially successful, Tucker's Essays were well-received - most notably by then-president James Madison - and it put him on the landscape when the newly-erected University of Virginia in Charlottesville was looking to hire some teachers.  George Tucker slid into the professorship of moral philosophy at the University of Virginia after the candidacy of Thomas Cooper  - Thomas Jefferson's preferred candidate - was rejected by the Virginia Assembly.  Tucker was appointed in 1825, on a salary of $1,500, as a compromise candidate between various religious and political factions.  George Tucker began delivering his first lectures on political economy at Virginia in 1826, and continued doing so continuously for the next two decades.  George Tucker's economics was of the ""clerical"" apologist school, defending laissez faire and free trade, widely embraced in the South, against the protectionist American System being pushed in the North.  His 1837 Laws was critical of Ricardo's theory of rent and distribution.  Tucker continued to write Tucker's most notable economics work was perhaps his Progress of the United States (1843), constructing a portrait of the demography and economy of the United States on the basis of the censuses from 1790 to 1840 (the 1855 edition contains an appendix on the 1850 Census).  In this work, among other things, Tucker tracks the expansion of slavery.  Despite his personal moral opposition to slavery, Tucker finds Abolitionist agitation to be counter-productive, making the political atmosphere so toxic that it is impossible for Southern opponents of slavery to speak out against it or stake a moderate position.  Tucker conjectures slavery becomes unprofitable as population density increases, and predicts that slavery in the US will naturally come to an end in eighty years.  Tucker's Progress was quite well-received abroad and earned him membership to a French scientific academy in Paris. In his lifetime, Tucker was perhaps best known for his monumental biography Life of Jefferson (1837). It was a judicious biography, trying to paint a balanced picture of the statesman, which satisfied neither Jeffersonians nor his opponents.  In 1845, Tucker resigned from the chair at Virginia, freed his slaves and moved to Philadelphia.   He continued publishing articles on economics and philosophy (notably on Hume in 1850). Tucker's 1856-57 History of the United States, met only moderate success.  Its defense of slavery in the South, however lukewarm, made it outdated almost immediately.  Tucker published his lecture notes from UVa as Political Economy for the People in 1859. George Tucker died in April 1861, in a freak accident, killed by falling cargo from a steamboat in the port of Mobile, Alabama.

Josiah Tucker, 1712-1799,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/tucker.htm," 18th C. liberal clergyman, economist, social reformer and political activist.  Josiah Tucker was born in Wales and educated at St. John's College, Oxford.  Ordained a clergymen, Josiah Tucker was appointed to parishes in Bristol.  His position in the bustling commercial town drew Tucker's attention to trade.  As Warburton would later remarked, when asked about the character of two clerics, Dr. Squire and Dr. Tucker, that the first (a notoriously corrupt cleric) made religion his commerce while the latter made commerce his religion. Josiah Tucker was appointed the Dean of Gloucester in 1758. Tucker is perhaps best known for his views on the relationship between Great Britain and its colonies. Tucker believed that Britain would do far better economically if it gave up its dreams of empire.  Arguing that English trade would not be injured by American independence, Tucker urged the British led the colonies go.   Unlike Edmund Burke, Tucker did not believe the American colonists were justified or had any relevance to the British at home.  Let the malcontents go, Tucker argued, Britain will be better off without them.  Although a latter-day Mercantilist, many of Tucker's economic arguments foreshadowed those of Adam Smith.  Tucker's 1750 Brief Essay was ""adapted"" into French by Plumart d'Angeul, and Tucker's arguments proved to be immensely influential on French Enlightenment economists, notably Vincent de Gournay and François Quesnay.  Jacques Turgot translated two of Tucker's pieces and opened correspondence with Tucker during the 1770s.   Tucker was also active in promoting the naturalization of Huguenots and Jews.

Mikhail Ivanovich Tugan-Baranovsky, 1865-1919.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/tugan.htm," The contributions of the Russian economsit Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky (sometimes spelt ""Tugan-Baranawsky"" or some variant thereof) fall into two related camps: business cycle theory and the Marxian theory of crises. Originally of Ukranian-Tartar origins, Tugan-Baranovsky graduated from the University of Kharkov in 1888.  Tugan-Baranovsky's 1894 treatise on business cycles, is the published version of his 1892 master's thesis at Moscow University.  In preparation, Tugan-Baranovsky had six months researching data at the British museum in London.  It is famous for providing arguably the first coherent and thoroughly ""economic"" theory of the business cycle. His theory, which relied on a Say's Law-breaking theory of credit and a primitive notion of the Keynesian ""multiplier"", argued that cycles were driven by an independent investment function and that, ultimately, ""overinvestment"" was the cause of recessions. His breakthrough work gave rise to a whole line of European business cycle theory stemming from Spiethoff through Cassel and Robertson all the way to the Kiel School and Hayek. His theory of the cycle also provided the groundwork for his later 1905 challenge to Marx's theory of capitalist crises. His cycle theory had already demonstrated that there is not necessarily a secular movement towards ""destruction"" but rather only wave-like patterns in capitalist economies. In his 1905 work, he extended this to argue that there are conditions whereby capitalist economies can arrive at a ""stationary state"" and thus arrest their move to crisis. Tugan-Baranovsky's challenge set the spark for a vociferous debate among Marxians between followers of his line (e.g. Hilferding) and upholders of the old inevitability doctrine (e.g. Kautsky and Adler). This was extended later to a debate on imperialism.  Tugan-Baranovsky eventually abandoned his Marxian roots and adopted the more socialist views of his previous opponents, the Populists (Narodniks), on co-operative economies. Tugan-Baranovsky's other contributions to economics include his 1898 dissertation on the economic history of the Russian factory (submitted for a doctorate at Moscow University).  This earned him an appointment as a lecturer at St. Petersburg University.  He was dismissed in 1899 due to his political proclivities, but restored in 1905.  Tugan-Baranovsky also pursued the quixotic effort to try to merge Marxian and Neoclassical theories of value into a single theory, that takes account of both objective and subjective factors, redefining surplus value in consumption terms. This was already presaged in a 1890 article, and elaborated in his 1909 textbook.   The notion was not well-received.  Nonetheless, in 1913, Tugan-Baranovsky was elected to the chair in political economy at St. Petersburg, but the appointment was overruled by the Tsarist Minister of Education.  In 1917, Tugan-Baranovsky left St. Petersburg, and took a position in the Law Faculty in Kiev.   It is at this time that he got heavily engaged in the cooperative movements, and served briefly as minister of finance for the putative Ukranian narodnik republic.  He died in 1919 in Odessa, while on his way to France.      Major works of Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky   HET   Resources of Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, 1727-1781.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/turgot.htm," Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot (Baron de l'Aulne) was perhaps the leading economist of 18th Century France. Although often lumped together with Quesnay and the Physiocrats, his contributions were quite distinct and advanced considerably upon Physiocratic theories.  Turgot can be said to have formed a distinct school of his own, counting the Abbé Morellet and the Marquis de Condorcet as close friends and disciples.  More importantly, Turgot exercised a deep influence upon Adam Smith, who was living in France in the 1760s and was on intimate terms with Turgot.  Many of the concepts and ideas in Smith's Wealth of Nations are drawn directly from Turgot.   Born to a prosperous merchant family in Paris, Jacques Turgot's father was the Michel Turgot to whom, apparently,  is owed the celebrated ""Map of Paris"" of 1739.  A brilliant student at the Sorbonne, Jacques Turgot was originally destined for a clerical-academic career.  He was made a prior of Sorbonne in 1749 and composed two discourses to be read in Latin.   Turgot's second discourse, on the progrés successifs de l'ésprit humain (1750) outlined his famous philosophy of history.  Turgot argued that human societies pass through cycles of barbarism and civilization, the former attended by superstition, the latter the fruits of reason.  He discussed the transfer from one to the other and back again.  Human restlessness, a taste for liberty and a critical spirit elevates societies into civilization, but then these impulses become institutionalized and conservative and become the very impediments of further progress.  Reason morphs into superstition, and society is driven back into barbarism.   So, for Turgot, human progress is not self-reinforcing but contains the seeds of its own demise. On the optimistic side, demise is never permanent.  Turgot was confident that the human spirit would always drive a society out of stagnation.  In many ways, Turgot's thesis has a rather prescient Comtian character.  Turgot hailed the France of Louis XV as very much in the upswing of the cycle.  It is interesting that he pointed out entrepreneurs were a progressive driving force and that the State would do well to permit great latitude. It also predicted the eventual revolt and independence of the American Colonies from the English Crown.   Not long after delivering the discourse, Turgot decided against ordination in the Church and instead entered a career in the royal administration.  From 1751 to 1760, Turgot worked at the parlement in Paris. He hobnobbed with the philosophes and contributed several articles (two of them on linguistics) to the famous Encyclopèdie of Denis Diderot.  In 1753, Turgot wrote his Lettres urging toleration of Protestants in France.  In 1755-6,  Turgot accompanied the free-trade advocate Vincent de Gournay on his official tours of France and, on their travels, Gournay got him thinking about economic matters. Upon Gournay's death, Turgot penned a marvelous eulogy to his fallen mentor (1759).  From 1761 to 1774, Turgot was chief administrator (intendant) for Limoges.  He immediately set himself to work -- fixing roads and drainage, improving tax collection, reducing internal tariffs, introducing a better relief system for the poor, etc. Limoges, hitherto one of the poorest areas of France, became a showpiece for what a determined and enlightened administrator could accomplish.   Many of the reforms he would later institute throughout France were first tested out here at a smaller scale.   Intellectually, this was also Turgot's most productive period.  His masterpiece was undoubtedly his Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Riches (1766).  Here, Turgot introduced the concept of capital into the Physiocratic system. He also clarified the meaning of ""surplus"" and provided the link between the ""surplus"" and ""growth"" and relating the profit rate to the rate of interest. He was also among the first to make clear the distinction between ""market"" price and ""natural"" price. As a result, Turgot differed from original Physiocrats on the nature of the produit net, i.e. that surplus could be generated by industry as well as agriculture.  All of these ideas were to be taken up by Adam Smith and the Classical School.   Turgot  can also be considered a forerunner of the Marginalist Revolution. His Valeurs et Monnaies  (1769) contains a strikingly well-developed demand-based theory of price.  In that same work, he presents a remarkably prescient account of how large number of traders reduce the degree of indeterminacy of exchange, a topic later taken up Edgeworth.   Another notable economic contribution (in his 1768 Observations) was the introduction of variable input proportions in production.  Turgot was also  the first to conceive of the notion of diminishing marginal productivity to factor inputs. Finally, his 1766 discussion on money included the distinction (not made hitherto) between the real and nominal rates of interest.  On account of his success as an administrator in Limoges and his impressive intellectual abilities, the Comte de Maurepas asked Turgot to join his new reformist cabinet.  Turgot was appointed as contrôleur général (the equivalent of a minister of finance) by King Louis XVI in August 1774.  As minister, Turgot was adamant about saving the finances of the decrepit Ancièn Regime.  He figured that if he could keep government spending in check and encourage private economic enterprise, tax revenues would rise and state finances would return to solvency.  However, he believed that the old Colbertiste strategy of state-sponsored corporations and protectionist measures kept industry uncompetitive and unproductive.  Inspired by Vincent de Gournay, Turgot intended to unleash the forces of competition and free markets.  To do so, not only would he have to reverse Colbertiste economic policies, he would also have to dismantle the Medieval institutions that kept the French economy in thrall.    Turgot started slowly, propping up growth industries such as the Lyons silk manufactures, improving roads and transportation, simplifying the tax system, improving tax collection, abolishing some monopolies, paying back public debts, etc.  He also began reigning back the lavish spending of the French court and government.  His slogan ""No bankruptcy, No new taxes, No loans"" left little room for anything else. In 1775, Turgot took one of his boldest moves and lifted the controls on the internal trade of grain.  This measure had been long advocated by Herbert, Gournay and Turgot himself (e.g.  1763, 1770).  Alas, the immediate beneficial impact of that policy was canceled by the crop failures of that same year.  Turgot dealt rather harshly with the ensuing riots -- the so-called ""Flour Wars"" -- earning him much notoriety among the populace. In 1776, Turgot issued his famous ""Six Edicts"".  The first four were of little consequence.  The fifth dissolved the guild system, which had since the Middle Ages kept a stultifying hold over commerce and industry. The sixth eliminated the corvée (i.e. the yearly labor owed by peasants to the state) and implemented the Physiocrats' favorite policy -- l'impôt unique (the single tax on property).  The nobleman and the landed gentry rose up in protest against both these measures.  Turgot was unmoved and enforced his policies by royal decree -- itself an unpopular strategy.   By now, Turgot had successfully made enemies with practically every class of person in France -- except the economistes, who cheered him on.  In the French court, his back was covered only by the king but, when Turgot crossed Queen Marie Antoinette by refusing favors to her protegès, the die were cast.  Turgot was dismissed in 1776. Before departing, Turgot presciently warned Louis XVI, ""Do not forget, Sire, that it was feebleness that placed the head of Charles II on the block.""  Condorcet (then at the royal mint) attempted to resign in protest.  Turgot was succeeded by Jacques Necker, who proceeded to reverse most of his edicts and policies. Turgot did not live to see the 1789 Revolution created by the economic tensions which his policies purportedly sought to defuse. Given his record, it is an open question whether Turgot might have been driven to guillotine by the revolutionaries.  Unlike his disciple, Condorcet, Turgot was not a republican and was unpopular among the people.  He was a staunch royalist who believed in radical reform as a necessary step to avert an even more radical revolution.  His methods may have been heavy-handed at times, but he realized, like nobody else did, the absolute urgency of reform.        Major works of  Jacques Turgot   Resources on A.R.J.

Hirofumi Uzawa, 1928-2014,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/uzawa.htm," Japanese mathematical economist, Neo-Walrasian theorist with significant contributions to theory of preference and stability theory.  Uzawa was also a developer of optimal growth theory, applied later in his career to environmental problems. Born in Yonago, Japan, Hirofumi Uzawa studied mathematics at the University of Tokyo. After graduating in 1951, Uzawa remained in Tokyo as a special research student, and was soon drawn into economics by the influence of Japanese Marxists. But Uzawa soon encountered the budding mathematical economics being developed by American Neo-Walrasians.  Uzawa proceeded to Stanford in 1956 as a research associate at the invitation of Kenneth Arrow, joining the Stanford faculty by 1959.  It was in this period where Uzawa made his major contributions to demand theory and Walrasian general equilibrium analysis.  Uzawa credits his celebrated two-sector growth model on the basis of his re-reading of Marx's second volume.  Uzawa remained at Stanford until 1964, when he joined the University of Chicago, where he produced his major contributions to optimal growth theory. For a year (1966), Uzawa was a fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge, during he came up with his ""Penrose effect"", an outcome of his ruminations on Veblen (the term, named after Edith Penrose, was suggested by Kahn) In 1968, Uzawa left the US, partly in protest against the Vietnam war, and became a professor at Tokyo University, remaining there until his retirement in 1989.  Practical problems of pollution in Japan drew Uzawa's attention to environmental problems and he developed his theory of ""social common capital"" already in the early 1970s, which was later applied to macro-environmental problems like climate change.   Uzawa continued to speak and write on environmental problems after his retirement.      Major Works of Hirofumi Uzawa       Resources on Hirofumi Uzawa   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Jacob Vanderlint, ?-1740.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/vanderlint.htm,"18th Century liberal Neo-Mercantilist pamphleteer about whom virtually nothing is known, other than he was a timber merchant of Dutch extraction living in London. Jacob Vanderlint developed a theory of international monetary equilibrium reminiscent of Sir Dudley North and Isaac Gervaise.  Vanderlint bases his arguments on the quantity theory of John Locke.  Vanderlint articulates a specie-flow mechanism to posit an international equilibrium with the equalization of prices across countries.  Countries with small gold stocks will have lower prices than countries with high gold stocks.  As a result, nations with scarcity of money will consequently export more and import less, and their trade surpluses will induce an inflow of specie (and consequently rising prices, eventually equating prices to those of other countries).  Vanderlint acknowledges that increases in money supply can expand economic activity, but notes that bank credit (as in John Law's schemes) will simply raise prices and turn the balance of trade against a country. Vanderlint prefers to focus on means of increasing real production as the key to lower domestic costs, expanding  exports. To this effect, he believed in the enclosure of land, the reduction of land rents and recommended the elimination of all taxes on commodities, proposing to base public finance on a ""single tax"" on land. Vanderlint was an advocate of free trade, proposing the elimination of trade barriers and tariffs, asserting countries would be better off by specializing in their (absolute) advantage.  But he maintains that an export surplus is desirable and should be a goal (""every nation ought to trade such foot as always on the whole to have the balance in their favour"").  He just believes this can be better accomplished by competitive advantages rather than government regulations. Vanderlint's analysis anticipates that of David Hume (indeed, to the point of some historians suggesting Hume may have simply copied Vanderlint - as almost alleged by Dugald Stewart).  His theory, and notably his ""single tax"", was influential on the Physiocrats..      Major Works of Jacob Vanderlint     Resources on  Jacob Vanderlint   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
"Sébastien le Prestre, Seigneur de Vauban", 1633- 1707,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/vauban.htm," French military engineer and early liberal. Sébastien Vauban was a military engineer and a Maréchal in Louis XIV's army.  His work on fortifications and siegecraft is legendary - some 160 locations are credited to Vauban.  The Corps de Génie had been separated from the rest of the army in 1676, but it was Vauban who transformed the Corps into a well-trained and highly-professional school of engineers.  The Corps eventually detached itself from its military roots (Vauban himself had embraced civil engineering projects, like the Languedoc canal) and eventually became institutionalized as the École des Ponts et Chaussées.  Vauban can consequently be regarded as the grandfather of the French engineering tradition.   Although indispensable to Louis XIV, Vauban boldly stretched his goodwill on several occasions.  In 1685, Vauban vocally condemned the repeal of the edict of Nantes (which led to the persecution of the French Protestants).  Interestingly, his opposition was mostly made on economic grounds.  In the 1690s, he conducted a comprehensive census of Flanders and other areas of France, which has earned him his nickname as the ""French Petty"".  A prolific writer on many subjects, e.g. forestry, pig breeding, monetary policy, colonization, etc., Vauban was made an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences.   Dismayed by the inefficiency of Colbertisme, Vauban published his 1707 tract  Projet d'une Dixme Royale (with his name on the title page and without the king's permission.)  Vauban called for the repeal of all taxes (taille, etc.) and the imposition of a single direct tax of 10% on all income from land and trade, with no exemptions for the nobles or clergy. He backed up his argument with an impressive mass of statistics.  In his vision, Vauban's 10% would not be a permanent rate, but rather a maximum, to be adjusted according to wartime exigency and general economic circumstances of the time, giving it a counter-cyclical character - by his estimate, it would average 6.6%,  and be lowered to 3.3% for workers during economically depressed times.  To maintain viability of overall finances, Vauban defended the introduction of some modest excise taxes on luxury items (wigs, swords, wine in taverns), etc. The publication of Vauban's proposal was a scandalous affair - largely because Vauban did not shy away from severely criticizing the current royal administration and describing the realm as a whole as misgoverned.  King Louis XIV took it as a personal affront, and Vauban fell into disgrace (he died shortly after).  His contemporary, Boisguilbert, who put out a similar treatise at exactly the same time, was caught up in the Vauban maelstorm and proscribed.  Nonetheless, in 1710, the controller-general Desmarets used Vauban's arguments to justify for the imposition of a Dixième along Vauban's design - albeit in addition to, rather than instead of, existing taxes.  The vigorous protest of the nobles and clergy eventually led to the sneaking in of exemptions, until it was entirely repealed in 1717.  Justified as an emergency wartime tax,  it was reimposed in 1733-36 to finance the war of Polish succession and 1741-49 for the war of Austrian succession.     The latter was particularly knotty, as although hostilities had ended in 1748, war debts were massive, and the controller-general Machault d'Arnouville could not bring himself to repeal the Dixème,.  To maintain the tax in peacetime and pay off war debts, Machault halved it to a 5% tax (the vingtième).  Vigorously opposed, it led to the fall of Machault and cleared the way for the ascendancy of the Madame de Pompadour. Vauban's work inspired many later Enlightenment economists, such as Forbonnais,  Mirabeau and the Physiocrats.

Count Pietro Verri, 1728-1797.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/verri.htm," Illustrious Milanese nobleman, government official and Enlightenment philosopher.  After an ill-fated love affair, a break with his family and a deep intellectual crisis, Pietro Verri arrived on the scene in 1757 with his sharp satirical annual, Il gran Zoroastro.  After a brief stint in the Austrian army in 1759-60, Verri returned to Milan, where he quickly fell in among the Italian Enlightenment figures of the day, notably the great Cesare Beccaria.  With Beccaria and his own brother, Alessandro Verri, he founded the ""Società dei Pugni"" in 1761, a discussion group concentrating on public policy and economics.  From 1764 to 1766, the group published the great Enlightenment journal, Il Caffè. Verri began publishing tracts on economic questions in 1760.   In 1763, he produced his Meditazioni sulla felicità, a treatise on hedonistic ethics along the lines of Helvétius (spiced with Rousseau), thus making him one of the fathers of utilitarianism.  It was Verri who pushed Beccaria into making his seminal contributions to utilitarian social philosophy.   After Il Caffè was closed down and the group dispersed, Verri took up a variety of posts in the Austrian administration.  He used this time to publish some of his most famous utilitarian tracts: his 1773 Discorso and his 1777 treatise denouncing the use of torture. Verri's 1771 Meditzioni sull' economia politica was perhaps his greatest contribution to economic theory.  Verri argued that price depends on the ""apparent abundance"" of a good and the ""need"" for it.  He defines ""need"" as a species of pain which humans seek to minimize activity and industry.  For Verri, ""needs"" are not mere desires but must be expressed with payment, thus they can be considered ""demands"" in the modern sense.  Following Beccaria, Verri noted that abundance increases with number of offers (i.e. sellers) and ""needs"" with the number of sellers.   He notes that the value of a commodity varies directly with need and inversely to abundance. In this manner, Verri can be regarded as an important predecessor of the Marginalist Revolution.   Verri's quantitative work includes not only admirable attempt at calculating the balance of payments, but also the first mathematical expression of a demand curve.  On economic policy, Verri followed the radical laissez-faire positions advocated by the Physiocrats.  Interestingly, he disagreed with Hume's ""reflux"" principle, arguing that balance of payments adjustment occur not through prices but rather through the levels of aggregate economic activity (thus making him an early Keynesian). In his official capacities in the Austrian administration, Verri tried to push many economic and administrative reforms through, with little success.  In 1772, Verri was vice-president, and then, in 1780, president, of the Chamber of Counts.  He retired from public life in 1786 and lived on long enough to welcome the French Revolution.

Jacob Viner, 1892-1970.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/viner.htm," Together with Knight, the Canadian-born Jacob Viner was the leading light of the Chicago School of the inter-war period. His work ranged all over economics, but it is perhaps his work on the history of economic thought and international trade theory that we find his remarkable strengths. Nonetheless, as Robbins characterized him, Viner was ""the outstanding all-rounder of his time in our profession"" (Robbins, 1970: p.2).   Born in Montreal, Canada, Jacob Viner obtained his B.A. from McGill in 1914, and his Ph.D. from  Harvard in 1922, under Frank Taussig   Although an instructor since 1916, Viner formally joined the faculty at the University of Chicago in 1925, where he remained until 1946, when he moved to Princeton. Jacob Viner's very first publication was on methodology (1917), in which he provided a full-fledged defense of the inductive method. His subsequent work was on problems in trade theory - a concern which he maintained throughout the rest of his career.  In International trade, Viner is notable for his work on dumping (1922, 1923) and the ""trade diversion"" thesis on customs unions (1950). This work was concurrent with his masterly 1921 and 1931 articles on price theory - the first began inching towards a theory of imperfect competition, the second providing an analytical and graphical exposition of the theory of the firm (the long-run and short-run cost curves we see in modern principles textbooks). A famous error on the long-run envelope of short-run average cost curves in his 1931 article and anticipation by Harrod did not diminish his claim to fame. Jacob Viner was fiercely opposed to the Keynesian Revolution - but not because of its policy prescriptions as indeed, Viner himself had recommended them. As he wrote in several papers (e.g. 1933), Viner believed the Great Depression was due to deflation in output prices being faster than the collapse in costs. Recovery, he believed, required a restoration of profit margins and thus government-induced inflation - not by monetary expansion, but rather by deficit spending. This would create the necessary price rise (and, with costs lagging, profits) and the consequent cumulative rise in output to pull the economy out of depression. He was very much a fiscal policy advocate and a believer in policy discretion rather than fixed rules - thus he did not take Milton Friedman's attempt to paint him as an ""early Monetarist"" very well. Viner's famous 1936 critique of Keynes was not over policy implications but rather a result of theoretical disputes over liquidity preference and what Viner thought was oversimplified theory of effective demand.  Viner preferred to famously characterize Keynesian theory as ""short-run"" analysis while considering Neoclassical theory to be true in the ""long-run"". It was Viner's scathing 1936 critique that prompted J.M. Keynes to write his famous 1937 QJE article as a response. Viner's work on ithe history of economic thought began with his 1926 essay on Adam Smith and culminated in his magnum opus, Studies in the Theory of International Trade (1937) - to which we owe most of our knowledge of the Bullionist Controversy in 19th Century Britain - and the masterful introduction to the 1965 reprint of Rae's Life of Adam Smith. Viner's relations with Knight were cool but respectful. Compared to Knight, Viner was less opposed to quantitative techniques but remained wary of them. A recurring, if pointless, amusement at Chicago was the controversy over cost theory between Knight and Viner - with Knight supporting the Austrian doctrine of opportunity cost and Viner espousing the Marshallian ""real cost"" theory. This position was, in fact, more than a personal diversion: Viner (1932, 1937), after all, had promoted a ""real cost"" version of the comparative advantage thesis as opposed to Haberler's ""opportunity cost"" version or Ohlin's ""factor-endowment"" version. Despite being one of the leaders of the Chicago School, Viner left Chicago for Princeton in 1946 - perhaps to the relief of many Chicago first-year students: Viner's ""price theory"" course was notorious for the terrifying way in which he conducted the classroom discussion. In later years, when questioned as to whether he thought himself part of the Chicago School, his reply was unequivocal: ""I am willing to consider the existence of a `Chicago School' (but not one confined to the economics department and not embracing all of the department) and that this `School' had been in operation, and had won many able disciples, for years before I left Chicago. But at no time was I consciously a member of it, and it is my vague impression that if there was such a school it did not regard me as a member, or at least as a loyal and qualified member"" (Letter to Patinkin, Nov. 24, 1969). Although he missed the Nobel awards, Viner was awarded the American Economic Association prestigious Francis A. Walker Medal in 1962 - the economics' profession's Nobel equivalent prior to 1969.        Major works of Jacob Viner     Resources on Jacob Viner   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
Francisco de Vitoria, 1485-1546.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/vitoria.htm," Spanish Dominican jurist, founder of the 16th C. Salamanca School. Of Basque origin, educated at the College Saint-Jacques in Paris, Francisco de Vitoria was appointed to the all-important chair of theology at the University of Salamanca in 1526.  He was a deep admirer of the northern Humanists, notably Erasmus (whom he defended in Paris) and, in the course of his career, was frequently consulted by Emperor Charles V. Francisco de Vitoria is widely regarded as the founder of the Salamanca School., particularly its marriage of ""natural law"" philosophy with Catholic doctrine.  Although he published nothing in his lifetime, his 1527-40 lectures (Relectiones) were assiduously recorded by his students. His De Indis lecture was an eloquent defense of Indian rights against enslavement.  Vitoria's thesis was highly influential and led the proclamation of the Leyes Nuevas by Charles V in 1542, which placed the indians directly under the protection of Spanish crown.  He also reviews the arguments raised by the Spanish conquistadors to justify their conquests in the Americas.  He systematically knocks down each and every defense used by the Spanish conquistadors - right of prior discovery, spreading the faith, expansion of empire, divine providence, etc.  Vitoria did come up with a justification for the Spanish empire, but one much diluted, stressing consent and voluntary adhesion by  the natives. Vitoria's second reflection, De Juri belli, considers in more depth the last reason - 'just war' - used by the Spanish conquistadors. Here he goes beyond the American adventure to lay down not only the general conditions for 'just war', but also many of the concepts and principles of the laws of nations.  His work was very influential on Hugo Grotius and he is justly regarded as the father (or grandfather) of modern international law. Unlike his successors, Francisco de Vitoria did not have much to say on economic matters, he did make a few comments.  He identified the just price as the common market price, but did not object to price controls.  For unique and luxury goods, he allowed the price to settle by free bargaining on the market, although advocated more conventional views on necessary goods..

François Arouet (Voltaire), 1694-1778.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/voltaire.htm," From Parisian middle class origins, François Arouet was educated at the Jesuit college of Louis le Grand.  After finishing school, Arouet found employment at the French embassy in the Hague, Netherlands, but this was shortlived.  Deciding to dedicate himself to literature, the young Arouet made a name for himself as a wit about town in Paris, and one of his epigrams skewering the French regent Philippe of Orleans even got him briefly imprisoned in the Bastille in 1717.  He rocketed to fame with his drama Oedipe in 1718, and adopted the pseudonym ""Voltaire"" in the aftermath.  He went on to compose and publish the Henriade, an epic poem on Henry IV of France of popular memory, which earned him the favor (and a pension) from Orleans, and entry into the regency court.  Voltaire cut a figure in the court and salons, as the quintessential philosophe. Voltaire's wit crossed the powerful Chevalier du Rohan, which led him to be beaten, imprisoned and banished from France in May 1726.  Voltaire spent two years in exile in England, deepening his familiarity with strands of English politics, ideology and thinking - becoming quickly enamored by the natural science of Newton, the  empirical philosophy of Locke and Mercantilist thought, and even charmed by Shakespearean theatre.  In his Letters on the English (1733), Voltaire credited English liberalism and freedom of thought, as well as its mercantile orientation, as the critical ingredient behind the success of English arms in recent wars. Although a friend of Quesnay, Voltaire  had a deep personal dislike of the Marquis of Mirabeau and became a virulent opponent of Physiocratic doctrine.  In his 1768 anti-Physiocratic tract, l'homme aux quarante ecus, Voltaire ridiculed the concepts of ""natural order"", ""net product"" and the ""single tax"".

Adolph H.G. Wagner, 1835-1917.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/wagner.htm," Adolph Wagner was one of the leaders of the ""Young"" German Historical School.  He was co-founder, with Gusav Schmoller, of the Verein für Sozialpolitik in 1872.  Adolph Heinrich Gotthelf Wagner was educated at Göttingen, receiving his doctorate in 1857. After some time teaching in vocational schools in Vienna and Hamburg, Wagner finally obtained a professorship in ""ethnography, geography and statistics"" at the German-speaking University of Dorpat in the Russian Baltics in 1865. He returned to Germany in 1868, taking up the cameralistic chair at Freiburg, and two years later, in 1870, was appointed professor of State economics (Staatswissenschaft) at the University of Berlin. Wagner set himself up as an expert on money and banking and public finance. Of conservative instincts in political matters, Wagner was a severe critic of unfettered capitalism and recommended State alleviation of the burden upon labor.     He was a close friend of Lassalle and Rodbertus - although he did not share their more radical socialist ideals. Wagner kicked off the ""Social Question"" debate in the 1870s, and was the eminence grise behind the formation of the Verein für Socialpolitik, which would lead to the Bismarckian social welfare reforms of the 1880s. Adolph Wagner is best known for Finanzwissenschaft (1877-1901) his majestic study of the theory of public finance.  Tolerant of, even enamored by, theoretical economics, Wagner was openly sympathetic to Carl Menger during the Methodenstreit of the 1880s between the Historical and Austrian Schools.

Abraham Wald, 1902-1950.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/wald.htm," Born in Kolozsvar/Cluj, Transylvania (now Romania, then part of Austria-Hungary) in 1902, to a poor orthodox Jewish family.  In 1927, Wald enrolled in the mathematics department of the University of Vienna, receiving his PhD in 1931. He was one of Karl Menger's students, and an active participant in Menger's Vienna Colloquium.  As a foreigner and a Jew, Wald was barred from academic positions in Austria.  Wald returned to Cluj in 1932, but his post-war hometown was no more welcoming, and his grasp of Romanian being weak, his options were limited.   Learning of Wald's precarious situation, Menger scrambled to get Wald back to Vienna, and arranged a position for Wald as the private tutor of the Viennese banker and amateur economist Karl Schlesinger in December 1932.  Another colloquium participant, Oskar Morgenstern, then the young director of Austrian Institute for Business Cycle research, managed to release some funds to secure a more permanent position for Wald. It was Schlesinger who  introduced Wald to the problems of the system of Walras and Cassel, which he wanted to bring to the attention of the mathematicians in the Vienna Colloquium.  Abraham Wald wrote three papers (1935, 1936a,b) on the Walras-Cassel system, employing the important ""Duality Principle"" and complementary slackness conditions which he (together with Schlesinger) developed for the Walras-Cassel G.E. system - which did away with the counting-equations- and-unknowns method, but allowed the return of Wieser's imputation theory back into economics and the employment of linear programming. Wald's third paper was particularly important and contributed several factors besides linear programming. Wald's paper was also the first proof of the existence of an equilibrium in a G.E. setting in economics. It also introduced several important concepts: the weak axiom of revealed preference (WARP) - later employed and developed by Paul Samuelson. He also addressed (briefly) the issue of whether it would hold in the aggregate (a question ignored and unanswered until the mid-1970s). He also defined a primitive form of the idea of ""gross substitution"" and provided a proof of the uniqueness of equilibrium. He also used these tools to tackle the existence of an equilibrium in a Cournot duopoly model. It is conjectured that Wald used a fixed point theorem (possibly derivative from von Neumman),  for another improved proof of equilibrium, that was apparently presented to the Vienna Colloquium session sometime in December 1935.  The details are unclear, and Wald's third paper was never published (it has since been lost).  Wald's summary of his first two papers, organized in an accessible form for economists, was published in the Zeitschrift fur Nationalokonomie in early 1936, makes no mention of it. Wald was a mathematician and thus, naturally, had a tenuous understanding of the ""economic"" significance of his work. It was only after Morgenstern's badgering that Wald wrote a summary of his two papers, accessible for economists,  to be published in the Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie in early 1936.  It nonetheless would take over a decade for the impressive economic implications of Wald's work to be appreciated.  Its significance only began being felt at the famous 1949 conference on activity analysis organized by Koopmans at the Cowles Commission., and Wald's results expanded later by Arrow, Debreu and others at the Cowles Commission.  Mindful of his duties at Morgenstern's Institute, Wald dedicated himself to statistics after 1936.  In relation to this, Wald's published a volume on seasonal fluctuations in business cycles in 1936 and a 1937 article on economic indexes.  The Vienna Colloquium was dispersed in 1937. shortly before the Germans took over Austria.  Wald was trapped in Austria after the Anschluss,  and dismissed immediately from the Institute by the Nazis.  He managed to leave Austria in the Summer of 1938, accepting an invitation from the Cowles Commission in Colorado Springs (arranged by Tintner). After only a few months, at Hotelling's urging, Wald gravitated to Columbia University in New York.  Wald continued his work on statistical theory, making several seminal contributions, such as the development of ""sequential analysis"" (1947) and the famous ""Wald Test"" (1939) so often employed in modern econometrics.  Kenneth Arrow, who would later provide his own seminal proof of existence with Debreu in 1954, was a student at Columbia during Wald's tenure. Wald was part of the Statistical Research Group (SRG) at Columbia, undertaking projects for the US military during WWII.  Wald's work on statistical decision theory reportedly influenced fellow SRG researcher Leonard J. Savage. Abraham Wald died tragically in a plane crash over India on December 13, 1950. Wald's colloquium papers were translated into English by William J. Baumol in 1968 (in Reprints of Scarce Works).  His ZfN paper was translated earlier by Otto Eckstein (1951, Econometrica)       Major works of Abraham Wald     Resources on Abraham Wald All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"
James Earl Waldegrave, 1684-1741.  ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/schools/game.htm#Waldegrave," Game Theory has emerged recently as a powerful challenger to the conventional method of examining economics. Although many illustrious predecessors worked on problems in what can be called ""game theory"", the fundamental, formal conception of game theory as part and parcel of economic theory were first organized in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's 1944 classic, Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944).  The main purpose of game theory is to consider situations where instead of agents making decisions as reactions to exogenous prices (""dead variables""), their decisions are strategic reactions to other agents actions (""live variables""). An agent is faced with a set of moves he can play and will form a strategy, a best response to his environment, which he will play by. Strategies can be either ""pure"" (i.e. play a particular move) or ""mixed"" (random play). A "" Nash Equilibrium"" will be reached when each agent's actions begets a reaction by all the other agents which, in turn, begets the same initial action. In other words, the best responses of all players are in accordance with each other. Game Theory can be roughly divided into two broad areas: non-cooperative (or strategic) games and co-operative (or coalitional) games. The meaning of these terms are self evident, although John Nash claimed that one should be able to reduce all co-operative games into some non-cooperative form. This position is what is known as the ""Nash Programme"". Within the non-cooperative literature, a distinction can also be made between ""normal"" form games (static) and ""extensive"" form games (dynamic). John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern (1944) introduced the strategic normal game, strategic extensive game, the concept of pure/mixed strategies, coalitional games as well as the axiomatization of expected utility theory, which was so useful for economics under uncertainty. They employed the ""maximin"" solution concept derived earlier by John von Neumann (1928) to solve simple strategic, zero-sum normal games.  In 1950, John Nash introduced the concept of a ""Nash Equilibrium"" (NE), which became the organizing concept under Game Theory -- even though the concept actually stretched as far back as Cournot (1838). Nash followed this up in 1951 with the concept of a ""Nash Bargaining Solution"" (NBS) for coalitional games. Then the floodgates opened for the refinement of Nash Equilibrium. In the field of non-cooperative games, R. Duncan Luce and Howard Raiffa (1957) provided the first popular textbook on game theory and, in it, they formalized the idea of the Iterated Elimination of Dominated Strategies (IEDS) method for Strategic Normal Games and introduced the concept of ""Repeated Game"" (static games which are played several times over). H.W. Kuhn (1953) introduced extensive games with ""imperfect information"" (i.e. where one does not know what moves have already been played by other players). William Vickrey (1961) provided the first formalization of ""auctions"". Reinhard Selten (1965) developed the concept of a ""Subgame Perfect Equilibrium"" (SPE) (i.e. elimination by backward induction) as a refined solution for extensive form games. John C. Harsanyi (1967-8) developed the concept of a ""Bayesian Nash Equilibrium"" (BNE) for Bayesian games (i.e. games with incomplete information - where there is some uncertainty surrounding moves, or where ""nature"" plays as well.) In coalitional (co-operative) games further refinements also occurred. Lloyd Shapley (1953) introduced the concept of the ""Shapley Value"" and the ""Core"" (which had been originally conceived by F.Y. Edgeworth (1881)) as solutions to Coalitional Games. Throughout the early 1960s, Robert J. Aumann and Martin Shubik began to apply cooperative game theory extensively throughout economics (e.g. industrial organization, general equilibrium, monetary theory, etc.), and, in the process, went on to invent several solution concepts for coalitional games (e.g. Bargaining Set, Strong Equilibrium), ""large games"" with infinite players and early statements of the ""Folk Theorems"" (solution concepts for Repeated Games). David Schmeidler (1969) developed the ""Nucleolus"" solution for coalitional games. Further developments emerged in the 1970s. John C. Harsanyi (1973) provided a remarkably insightful new interpretation of the concept of a ""mixed strategy"". Robert J. Aumann (1974) defined ""Correlated Equilibrium"" for Bayesian Games while Reinhard Selten (1975) introduced ""Trembling Hand Equilibrium"" for Bayesian Games. Further definitions came: Robert J. Aumann (1976) formally defined the concept of ""Common Knowledge"", opening a floodgate of literature, while B.D. Bernheim and D.G. Pearce (1984) formalized the concept of ""rationalizability"". Advancements continued apace: David M. Kreps and Robert Wilson (1982) introduced the concept of ""Sequential Equilibrium"" (SEQE) for extensive games with imperfect information.   Ariel Rubinstein (1982), following an early insight by Frederik Zeuthen (1930), transformed the co-operative Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) into a non-cooperative strategic extensive game of sequential bargaining. Elon Kohlberg and Jean-François Mertens (1986) developed the concept of ""Forward Induction"" for extensive games. Drew Fudenberg and E.S. Maskin (1986) developed one of the more famous ""Perfect Folk Theorems"" for infinitely repeated games. Finally, J.C. Harsanyi and R.Selten (1988) developed the idea of ""equilibrium selection"" for any type of game while D. Fudenberg and Jean Tirole (1991) developed the ""Bayesian Perfect Equilibrium"" (BPE) for Extensive Bayesian Games . Evolutionary game theory started its development slightly later.  Its objective is to apply the concepts of non-cooperative game theory to explain such phenomena which are often thought to be the result of cooperation or human design - i.e. ""institutions"" and ""conventions"" such as market formation, price mechanisms, social rules of conduct, money and credit, etc. One of the earliest exponents of the theory of evolutionary games was Thomas C. Schelling (1960, 1981) who argued that apparently ""cooperative"" social institutions (in this case, settlements to conflicts) are maintained by essentially by ""threats"" of punishment and retaliation  This has been followed up particularly in the 1990s.. Several Nobel Prizes have been awarded to some of major figures of Game Theory: the Nobel was shared by John Nash, J.C. Harsanyi and R. Selten in 1994 and William Vickrey and James Mirrlees in 1996. Herbert Simon won the Nobel in 1979 for concepts (e.g. bounded rationality) which have since been incorporated into the corpus of (Evolutionary) Game Theory.

Jacob Waley, 1818-1873,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/waley.htm,"English jurist and economist.  Educated at University College London under Augustus de Morgan, graduating in 1839 with a degree in both mathematics and classics, and the first UCL student to earn an M.A. Waley was subsequently admitted to Lincoln's Inn and, in 1842, became only the third Jew to be called to the bar. Waley built up a reputation as a renowned conveyancer and a prominent and active figure in the London Jewish community, becoming the first president of the Anglo-Jewish Association.

In 1854, Jacob Waley was appointed Professor of Political Economy at University College London, and was singularly responsible for reviving the chair, which had been in abeyance at that institution since J.R. McCulloch left in 1835. Waley's most cited contribution was a paper read before the Political Economy Club in late 1866 (subsequently published in JRSS), investigating whether strikes and labor activity actually do have an effect on wages (Waley concluded they did.). Given how little he wrote, Waley's own positions on economics are obscure.  One of the students he examined in1860 -- William Stanley Jevons -- estimated Waley's predilections to be decidedly in the school of Mill, although that might be based more on Jevons's resentment for having achieved a Third in the UCL examination by Waley.  The examinations set by Waley seem to indicate an inclination towards Senior (until recently, an external examiner an UCL)

In 1865-66, Waley retired, but not without commenting on the controversy then swirling around the appointment to the philosophy chair at UCL.  Waley organized a petition in support of Augustus de Morgan and deploring the conduct of the administration. Waley remained joint secretary of the Political Economy Club until his death.

Amasa Walker, 1799-1895.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/amasawalker.htm,"  Massachusetts businessman, politician and educator.  He was the father of Francis Amasa Walker. Amasa Walker was born in the village of Woodstock, Connecticut, the son of a blacksmith.  Shortly after his birth, the Walkers relocated to what is now North Brookfield, near Worcester, Massachusetts.  A sickly child, Amasa Walker would be plagued by health problems all his life.  He received a modest education at the local village school, while working on his father's farm, and subsequently worked as a clerk in several nearby stores.  In 1817, Amasa Walker enrolled in Amherst College, but was forced to withdraw for health reasons. In 1820, Amasa went into business as a shopkeeper in West Brookfield. In 1823, he divested from the store, and became an agent of a manufacturing company in Methuen.  In 1825, Amasa Walker moved to Boston, opening a business there.  He would rise to become a successful shoe manufacturer.  Amasa also became a bank director and was a keen railroad promoter, serving as director of the Western Railroad connecting Boston to Albany in the 1830s, and heavily promoted a scheme to build a railway between New England and St. Louis, Missouri.  The Panic of 1837 ravaged his businesses, and another bout of ill-health, forced Amasa Walker to retire from business in 1840 at the age of 41. The Panic of 1837 had turned Walker's attentions to economics. After retiring from his business activities, Walker became a college teacher, lecturing on political economy at Oberlin College in Ohio from 1842 to 1848, before getting more heavily involved in local Massachusetts politics.  Amasa Walker was a prominent abolitionist, and one of the founders of the Free Soil party in 1848 and was elected that same year to the Massachusetts state legislature.  He went as a delegate to the international peace conferences in London in 1843 and Paris in 1849.  Walker later served as Secretary of State for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1851-53.  From 1853 to 1860, Walker was an outside examiner in political economy at Harvard.  Between 1854 and 1869, Walker lectured at Amherst College. During this period, Amasa Walker wrote extensively in the commercial press of the day. An ardent Jacksonian, Walker had promoted the sub-treasury system.  In 1857, Walker began to contribute a series of articles on political economy to Hunt's Merchants' Magazine, evidently based on his college lectures.  His series had only just reached the topic of money when the Panic of 1857 hit. Walker's articles, transformed to address the crisis, his public call for suspension of convertibility to save Boston banks, and a small tract on money published that same year, cemented Walker's reputation as a leading expert on financial matters.  Amasa Walker became the pre-eminent American advocate of the ""Currency School"", and urged a 100% gold reserve requirement for banknotes. Walker continued lecturing at Amherst, interrupting for a brief stint in the House of Representatives in 1862-63 during the Civil War.  After the war, in 1866, Amasa Walker published his Science of Wealth, his principal work, centered around his currency ideas and channeling the laissez-faire traditions of French liberal school into early American economics.  It became a successful textbook, and went through many editions.  Amasa Walker's economic ideas would be carried onwards by his son Francis Amasa Walker.

Francis Amasa Walker, 1840- 1897.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/walker.htm," Widely regarded as the ""dean"" of  American economics.  Francis Amasa Walker was born on June 2, 1840.  His father, the economist  Amasa Walker had settled in Amherst, Massachusetts where Walker was to get his early education.  He acquired his B.A. from Amherst College in 1860 and joined a law firm.  In 1862, when the American Civil War broke out,  Francis Walker volunteered for the Union Army of the Potomac.  His bravery and prowess earned him quick promotions and many wounds.  He was captured by Confederate forces at Petersburg in 1864, but was returned later that year during a prisoner exchange.  In 1865, while still twenty-four, he was brevetted brigadier general.    After the war, Walker returned to Amherst to teach Greek and Latin at Williston Seminary and Amherst College.  He helped his father prepare his 1866 treatise Science of Wealth and fully absorbed his father's teachings in Classical economics   However, bored by abstraction, Walker left for Washington DC in 1869 in the hopes of starting up a career in journalism.   For a year, he worked under David A. Wells at the Bureau of Statistics at the Treasury.  Walker did such an exceptional job that he was appointed superintendent of the tenth U.S. Census of 1870.  He had just turned thirty.  Walker's unusually thorough collection, sifting and presentation of the census results (published in 1874 as the Statistical Atlas earned him a well-merited applause from statisticians and scholars everywhere.   In 1871, he worked for a while as Commissioner for Indian Affairs in the Grant administration.  In 1872, Walker was invited by Yale University to replace Daniel Coit Gilman at the Sheffield Scientific School.  Walker was Yale's first professor of political economy. Walker's stay at Yale, however, was not a very happy one.  Without a Yale B.A. and confined to the Sheffield ghetto, Walker felt very much the outsider there.  His rival at Yale College, the dogmatic conservative economist William Graham Sumner, had the ear of the administration.  Sumner's abrasive personality grated on Walker.  The statistically-minded Walker was kindly disposed towards the ""New Generation"" of German-trained American economists, whereas Sumner saw them as his enemies.  Perhaps because of this, Walker did not pass up opportunities to absent himself from Yale.  For a time (1877-79), Walker served as visiting professor at the fledgling the Johns Hopkins University, one of the returnees' citadels. In 1878, Walker was the US delegate to the international monetary conference in Paris, and subsequently accepted appointment as the superintendent of the 1880 census. Francis A. Walker finally resigned from Yale in 1881 to become one of the first presidents of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), presiding over a period of rapid growth of that institution.  Walker was also elected president of the American Statistical Association (ASA) in 1882 and was drafted by the ""new generation"" economists to became the first president of the American Economic Association (AEA) in 1885. (from 1947, the AEA would award the ""Walker Medal"" every two years, to prominent economists for their lifetime achievements; this was discontinued after 1977, with the advent of the Nobel Memorial prize.) Throughout his life, Walker strove to establish the ""scientific"" status of economics, and was a pioneer in using statistical data to illustrate economic arguments. While not really a ""Neoclassical"" in the strict sense, Walker nonetheless helped bury Classical economics by his 1875 demolition of the ""Wages Fund"" doctrine.   This was followed up in his 1876 book, The Wages Question.  Walker went on to develop a unique theory of distribution, which generalized the Ricardian theory of rent to explain the returns to labor, capital and entrepreneurship - -- thereby presaging the marginal productivity theory of distribution.  Walker posited his new theory in an 1887 article in the QJE and challenged critics to tear it down.  This led to a series of polemics in the QJE of 1887-90 with Silas MacVane, Sidney Webb and others taking up the gauntlet. Avidly courted by both by both American Neoclassicals and the American Institutionalists, Walker cannot readily be classified as either.  Being the son of Amasa Walker, Francis Walker was also particularly interested in currency questions, authored a well-received textbook on money, and became a proponent of bimetallism.  But Walker also grew increasingly conservative with age.  He eventually became an outspoken apologist of the Gilded Age and a formidable opponent of Henry George, socialists, populists and immigration.      Major works of Francis A.

Rev. Robert Wallace, 1697-1771,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/robertwallace.htm,"Edinburgh-educated Scottish philosopher and cleric.  Educated at the University of Edinburgh, Robert Wallace was a Presbyterian Kirk of Scotland minister in Moffat (Dumfriesshire, southwest Scotland) and later at Edinburgh.  Robert Wallace is principally remembered for his Dissertation on population, originally read before the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh c.1746, but published only in 1753.  Wallace proposed the hypothesis that population was correlated with availability of food, and consequently that nations which focused on agriculture tended to be more populous.  Wallace proposed an explicit natural rate of population growth - calculating that population naturally doubled every 33½ years (p.5).  As that rate was not seen empirically at the time, Wallace surveyed the various current socio-economic conditions (and policies) which kept population growth in check.  Echoing Berkeley, Wallace points to increasing taste for luxury and neglect of agriculture for keeping population growth less than what it might otherwise be (p.19).  He compares the condition of 18th C. Europe unfavorably with the Ancient world.   Wallace's contention that population had declined since the Ancient era was famously contested by David Hume's 1752 discourse, prompting Wallace to append an extensive rejoinder in the 1753 published edition.  Wallace's insights and research on demographics was highly influential on Robert Malthus's theory of population. In his 1758 Characteristics treatise, Wallace was articulated a latter-day version of Mercantilism and contested Hume's Quantity Theory of Money, arguing the increasing the supply of money could increase industry and wealth.  Wallace's  sermon on Various Prospects  (1761) is a general lament on the condition and prospects of the modern world.  In an thought exercise, Wallace articulates a remarkably utopian vision of a communistic world without property, geared to happiness and propagation, although he quickly dashes this with a pessimistic prophecy about how even such utopian state of affairs was doomed, as population growth would eventually hit its natural resource barrier, with the resulting Malthusian evils of poverty, famine and conflict.

Auguste Walras, 1801-1866.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/augustewalras.htm," French school inspector, administrator and teacher, proto-marginalist and highly influential father of Léon Walras.  Auguste Walras's own efforts are primarily a celebrated 1831 sketch of a theory of value, which Leon Walras was to draw upon.  Walras père taught his son to make rareté (both scarcity and utility) the source of value and encouraged him in the use of mathematical tools. His policy stance on land nationalization was also adopted by the young Walras.      Major Works of Auguste Walras   Resources on A.A. Walras ""Un initiateur en economie politique: A.-A.

Léon Walras, 1834-1910.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/walras.htm,"  The French economist Marie-Ésprit Léon Walras (pronounced ""Valrasse"") has been hailed by Joseph Schumpeter as ""the greatest of all economists"" (Schumpeter, 1954: p.827). Walras was one of the three leaders of the Marginalist Revolution, even though his greatest work, Elements of Pure Economics, was published in 1874, three years after those of William Stanley Jevons and Carl Menger. Nonetheless, alone among the three revolutionaries, Léon Walras set forth the new ""marginalist"" or ""Neoclassical"" theory in a formal general equilibrium setting.   Thus, he endowed it with the multi-market considerations Jevons had largely avoided and the mathematical precision Menger had eschewed. Léon Walras is widely and rightfully regarded as the father of general equilibrium theory. From any biography, the principal elements of Walras's life can be told.  He was the son of the French proto-marginalist economist and schoolteacher, Auguste Walras.  After spending a Bohemian youth in Paris as a novelist and art critic, Léon Walras soon followed his father's footsteps on almost every count: he adopted his father's socialist policy positions on taxation and land reform (in fact, he was a proponent of outright land nationalization) as well as his main ideas on economic theory (subjectivist theory of value, the mathematization of economics). After spending some unfruitful years in the cooperatives movement, Walras was appointed to the Academy of Lausanne in 1870.  It was there that he wrote and published the first edition of his magnum opus, the Elements of Pure Economics (1874). Léon Walras's Elements should be familiar to every modern economist, as it encompasses much of what is available to us in modern general equilibrium theory.  Walras set out his Elements in progressive stages of complexity and generality.  Its eight parts can be briefly summarized: In the aftermath of the Elements, Walras tried to build up a correspondence with virtually every important economist of the time, from America to Russia, in an effort to popularize his new theory. He found sympathizers and followers among several technically-gifted young Italians (e.g. Barone and Pareto) and Americans (e.g. Moore and Fisher). However, for the most part, he was largely ignored or dismissed by contemporary economists and mathematicians.  In 1893, Walras was succeeded in his chair by his young disciple, Vilfredo Pareto.  The two men formed the core (and some argue the full extent) of what became known as the Lausanne School"".  While they agreed on most theoretical matters, the details of the subsequent research program were dictated more by Pareto's interests than Walras's original concerns. Walras had envisaged his 1874 Elements as part of a larger work. However, by the 1890s, Walras's mental capacities had begun to fail and it became doubtful that he would be able to complete this grand oeuvre in the manner he had originally intended  Walras hastily compiled two volumes,  Studies in Social Economics (1896) and the Studies in Applied Economics (1898).  Although little more than compilations of previously published articles, he still considered these books complementary to the Elements.   Tellingly, the 1874 Elements are subtitled ""theory of social wealth"", while his 1896 book is subtitled ""theory of the division of social wealth"" and his 1898 book ""theory of the production of social wealth.""  He regarded all three volumes as integral, indivisible and essential pillars for his general economic theory.   Unfortunately, most economists dismissed these last two volumes as ""light"" stuff or, worse, a mere platform for socialist politics.  Today, as then, the Elements alone is regarded as his Walras's only ""true"" contribution.  However, some economists continue to believe that, because his other two volumes were not taken into account, modern Neo-Walrasian G.E. theory has not adhered to Walras's original vision, either in general purpose or in detail.   Modern economists have also dismissed Walras's attempt, in a later (1896) edition of the Elements, to take credit for the discovery of the marginal productivity theory of distribution (and denouncing Wicksteed's claim to priority), not only as lacking any basis in truth but even as mean-spirited.  It is widely acknowledged that Walras learnt this theorem from Enrico Barone. (although, in a striking coincidence, Walras had been handed the theorem on a piece of paper from the Lausanne mathematician, Hermann Amstein, in 1877, but had not understood the mathematics well enough the make heads or tails out of it!)  The last decade of Walras's life was spent in frustrated loneliness, bitter at the neglect of his work,  incapacitated by senility and mental illness. He died on January 5, 1910.

Clark Warburton, 1896-1979.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/warburton.htm,"American Institutionalist economist, and proto-Monetarist. Clark Warburton was educated at Columbia under Wesley Clair Mitchell, receiving his Ph.D. in 1932.  From 1934, Warburton was employed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), where he remained until his retirement in 1965.  Warburton's principal contribution, arising from his independent empirical research into business cycles while at the FDIC,  was in identifying erratic changes in the money supply  as the principle driver of the cycle (e.g. 1945, 1946).  He criticized Keynesian economics for ""misplaced emphasis"" on investment and effective demand. Warburton contributions dried after 1953, partly as a result of the FDIC withdrawing permission for him to undertake independent research on their time.  As a result, Warburton work was already half-forgotten during the controversies of the 1960s and 1970s.  Nonetheless, Monetarists have hailed Warburton as an important anticipator of their school.      Major works of Clark Warburton     Resources on Clark Warburton   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

Max Weber, 1864-1920.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/weber.htm," Max Weber is best known as one of the leading scholars and founders of modern sociology, but Weber also accomplished much economic work in the style of the ""youngest"" German Historical School.  He is the older brother of location theorist Alfred Weber. Weber's family was an old Protestant family originally from the Catholic ecclesiastical state of Salzburg which, but had moved to Bielefeld (in northern German) because of counter-reformation efforts by the Archbishop of Salzburg.  While  Max's uncle retained the family manufacturing firm in Bielefeld, his father, Max Weber Sr, pursued a professional career as a magistrate in Erfurt. Max Sr. would later become a politician, serving as a deputy of the conservative National Liberal Party in the Prussian Diet in the 1870s.  Max's mother was a devout Calvinist.  Max Weber studied law and agrarian history at the University of Heidelberg and then Berlin.  He produced two dissertations - one in law (on commercial law in medieval Italy) and one on history (on the agrarian Roman history).  Weber married his second cousin, Marianne, in 1893.  He was appointed professor of economics at Freiburg in 1895, but moved the next year to a chair in political science at Heidelberg in 1896, succeeding Karl Knies. However, in 1897 Weber suffered a mental breakdown (shortly after the death of his authoritarian father) which left him essentially incapacitated for the next five years.  He recovered and returned to Heidelberg in 1902. After a trip to the United States in 1904 (to attend the St. Louis World's Fair), and upon his return worked on his Protestant Ethic.  Shortly after, Weber struck up an affair with former student Else von Richthofen, who also happened to be the wife of his colleague, the economist Edgar Jaffé (Else later went on to become the paramour of his brother, Alfred Weber).  Max Weber followed up on his work with series of studies of world religions, writing on Confucianism and Taoism (1913), on Hinduism and Buddhism (1916) and on Judaism (1917-19), eventually published in 1920-21.  Through the latter part of his life, Weber worked on his magnum opus, Economy and Society, which he began in 1914, but it remained unfinished upon his death in 1920.  Although Max Weber and Werner Sombart are often lumped together as part of that generation in German economics, no two men could be less alike. The superficial, fanciful and Kaiser-worshipping Sombart was nothing like the thorough, rational and Kaiser-despising Weber. Nonetheless, while Weber was not completely immune from German nationalism, he was just not the military-imperial jingoist Sombart was.  Weber firmly believed that the Herrenvolk should circumscribe their ambitions. That personal attitude was reflected in his most famous economic work, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905, initially published as articles in the Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik). In it, Weber argued that the presumed anti-capitalist Puritanical rhetoric of eschewing earthly acquisitiveness was actually an impetus for that very acquisitiveness. The thesis was novel and well-known. Catholicism, Weber argues, was tolerant towards the acquisition of earthly gain and winked at lavish expenditure, an idea engendered by hierarchical structure of the Church (which required struggling and jockeying for ""position"") as well as its own tradition of lavish expenditure (the church) and its oft-used earthly powers of forgiveness for sin. This might make one conclude that the Catholic ethic was more predisposed towards capitalism than the Protestant (as others, before and since, have argued).   But no, replied Weber. It is true that the Protestant doctrines asked men to accept a humbler station and concentrate on mundane tasks and duties and, without a hierarchical church structure, there was no example of upward-mobility, acquisitiveness and expenditure. Yet it was precisely this that engendered the ""work-and-save"" ethic that gave rise to capitalism. Dedication to and pride in one's work, Weber claimed, is inevitably a highly productive attitude. The Lutheran mandate of worldly calling, reinforced by the Calvinist doctrine of predestination, changed practical ethics and made the rise of capitalism possible.  The Protestant ethic of ""godliness"" through the humble dedication to one's beruf (calling/duty/task), meant economic productivity was consequently higher in Protestant communities. By contrast, prior Catholic ethics saw work as merely a means to an end - to consume.  Once one's material needs were met, work was set aside and one dedicated one's self to other, higher pursuits.  The upward-mobility that was possible in hierarchical Catholic society meant that a lot of people found themselves in jobs which they saw only as way-stations to higher and better positions - thereby dedicating only a minimal or nominal attention to the given task as finding it either beneath their dignity or certainly not worth resigning to as their end in life.  Consequently, Weber concluded, Catholic communities tended to be less productive. The higher productivity of Protestant communities was coupled with higher thriftiness. The sinfulness of expenditure and lavish display of earthly goods was a notable Protestant pietist principle. So too was it Catholic, but the Catholic Church had been more prepared to forgive these (and other) sins. The Protestant church had no such power and thus the inducement to the faithful to stay modest in consumption was high. Yet the higher productivity of the Protestant essentially meant that they earned more than the Catholic, and yet because they saved more, they essentially accumulated; the Catholic was less productive but spent more. Thus, Weber concluded, the idea of ""capitalist accumulation"" was born directly out of the Protestant ethic - not because the Protestant churches and doctrines condoned acquisitiveness as such (often quite the contrary), but rather quite inadvertently through its claim to productive dedication to beruf and thriftiness. The subsequent ethical ""legitimization"" of capitalist acquisitiveness in later society under the rubric of ""greed is good"" was simply a distorted statement of what was already a fact. In no sense, claimed Weber, is the capitalist ethic of ""greed"" the creator of ""capitalist society"" (however much it might later be a propagator), but, rather, quite the opposite.  Weber's 1905 thesis (echoed independently by R.H. Tawney) was naturally quickly disputed and has since been more or less discredited as a ""complete"" theory of the rise of the capitalism.  In particular, the empirical assertion associating Protestantism with prosperity and Catholicism with otherwise, was disputable.  But the more significant aspect was its timing.  The Protestant reformation occurred in the 16th Century, while the capitalist system only came to fruition in the 19th Century.  This challenged the Marxian theory of historical materialism, that asserted ideas emerged from economic conditions.  Weber seemed to be arguing the opposite, that the ideas associated with capitalism - accumulation as an ethical imperative, rationalism as a world view - preceded the economic system by centuries, and emerged quite independently of it, from religious doctrines.  Weber did not quite establish a rigid causality, he did not claim the ideas caused the economic system in some deterministic Hegelian fashion. Rather, Weber preferred to assert that Protestant ideas facilitated the emergence of  capitalism.  He leaves room for real economic facts causing the rise of capitalism.  But these material facts only bore their transformative fruit in a ground where practical ethics had been previously transformed by religious ideas.  Weber uses the Goethean term ""elective affinity"" (""Wahlverwandtschaften"", p.54), sometimes translated as ""correlations"", to describe the relationship between ideas and the material system reinforcing each other.  While the material basis for the emergence of capitalism existed in other societies before, in Catholic Renaissance Italy or Confucian China, religious ethics did not facilitate or reinforce its growth. Weber's other main contributions to economics (as well as to social sciences in general) was his work on methodology. There are two aspects to this: his theory of Verstehen, or ""Interpretative"" Sociology and his theory of positivism. His Verstehen doctrine is as well-known as it is controversial and debated. His main thesis is that social, economic and historical research can never be fully inductive or descriptive as one must/should/does always approach it with a conceptual apparatus. This apparatus Weber identified as the ""Ideal Type"". The idea was essentially this: to try to understand a particular economic or social phenomena, one must ""interpret"" the actions of its participants and not only describe them. But interpretation poses us a problem for we cannot know it other than by trying to classify behavior as belonging to some prior ""Ideal Type"". Weber gave us four categories of ""Ideal Types"" of behavior: zweckrational (rational means to rational ends), wertrational (rational means to irrational ends), affektual (guided by emotion) and traditional (guided by custom or habit). Weber admitted employing ""Ideal Types"" was an abstraction but claimed it was nonetheless essential if one were to understand any particular social phenomena for, unlike physical phenomena, it involved human behavior which must be understood/interpreted by ideal types. Economists prick up your ears - for here is the methodological justification for the assumption of ""rational economic man""! Weber's work on positivism or rather his controversial belief in ""value-free"" social science, is also still debated. While his arguments in this respect were not novel, they did signal a complete and forceful break with Schmoller and the ""Young"" Historical School. Weber's other contributions to economics were several: these include a (seriously researched) economic history of Roman agrarian society (his 1891 habilitiation), his work on the dual roles of idealism and materialism in the history of capitalism in his Economy and Society (1914), present Weber on his anti-Marxian run. Finally, his thoroughly researched General Economic History (1923) is perhaps the Historical School at its empirical best. Max Weber's position as an economist has been debated, and indeed, it is generally accepted now that it is in sociology that his impact was greatest. However, he comes at the end of the ""Youngest"" German Historical School where no such distinctions really existed and thus must be seen as an economist in that light.

Pelatiah Webster, 1726-1795.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/webster.htm,"American clergyman, Philadelphia merchant and early economist and political theorist Born in Lebanon, Connecticut, Pelataiah Webster studied theology at Yale, graduating in 1746 and was ordained a Congregationalist minister in 1749. After a period as a preacher in Greenwich, Massachusetts, Webster moved to Philadelphia in 1755, to take up the career as merchant (""as a matter of necessity rather than inclination"").  He amassed a small fortune, while also teaching at an academy in nearby Germantown.

Pelatiah Webster was a keen supporter of the American Revolution of 1776.  Webster was arrested and imprisoned twice by the British authorities - in 1777 and again in 1778.

Webster one of the earliest commentators on the fiscal conduct and economic consequences of the American revolution. In October 1776, the middle-aged Webster wrote his first economics tract, an article in the Philadelphia newspaper, warning of the dangers of the unbacked paper currency issued by the Continental Congress. To fend off the prospects of inflation. Webster urged the introduction of a national tax to siphon off excess Continental notes. He continued writing as the war progressed. Starting in July 1779, Webster published seven pamphlets under the generic title of Free Trade and Finance. Webster urged the Continental Congress to rely on taxation, rather than foreign loans or printing notes, to fund the war.  The continental notes were discontinued in the Spring of 1781. 

Seeing the disparate Confederation as politically inadequate for fiscal purposes, Webster urged greater union, and became an early advocate of the federalist cause. In February 1783, Webster published his political Dissertation calling for the establishment of a new federal constitution, outlining a bicameral legislature and an independent federal judiciary.  As a result, some historians have taken to calling Pelatiah Webster the ""Architect of the Constitution"".  Although there is no good evidence that the Constitutional congress of 1787 took his model as a blueprint, his Dissertation was reportedly influential on James Madison.  Webster agitated in favor the 1787 Constitution against critics in Pennsylvania. Pelatiah Webster was active during the bank debate of 1785-86.  West Pennsylvania farmers, in a bid to obtain easier credit, got the Pennsylvania assembly to vote for the issue of paper money in March 1785.  They followed this up with a repeal the charter of the Bank of North America (f.1781) in September 1785, blaming the bank for the scarcity of money and fuming against its de facto monopoly.  The Philadelphia merchant community cried foul, and Webster joined Robert Morris, Thomas Paine and others in denouncing paper money, defending the bank and agitating for a revival of the bank charter, arguing point-for-point against the bank's critics. The effort eventually succeeded, and the Bank of NA's charter was revived in March, 1787, just before the constitutional convention.

David Ames Wells, 1828-1898,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/wells.htm,"   19th C. American scientist, journalist and economist. Originating from Springfield, Massachusetts, David A. Wells was educated at Williams College, receiving his degree in 1847, and going on to study at Harvard's Lawrence Scientific School, being among its first graduates in 1852.  He was promptly appointed professor at Lawrence, and simultaneously  became a lecturer at the Groton Academy.  With George A. Bliss, Wells compiled an Annual of Scientific Discovery for fifteen years, intending to popularize the physical sciences among students and the general public.  In the late 1850s, he published a series of books for popular audiences on the principles of chemistry, geology and physical sciences. Wells's Natural Philosophy (1857), although designed for general audiences, was a popular college textbook. From 1864, Wells took a decided turn towards economic topics. David A. Wells started out as a tentative protectionist, defending Lincoln's tariffs.  In 1865, on the strength of a popular pamphlet on public finance, President Abraham Lincoln appointed David A. Wells as head of the newly-established Federal Revenue Commission.  Wells's 1866-69 reports are considered classics in public finance and he quickly acquired a substantial reputation as the leading fiscal authority in the United States.  David A. Wells converted to the liberal cause after a fact-finding tour of Europe on behalf of the government in 1867.  He returned a confirmed believer in free trade and a laissez-faire activist.  Like his hero, Frederic Bastiat (whose works he helped edit), Wells sought to bring the free trade message to the American popular audience, and was sometimes referred to as the ""American Cobden"".  Wells became a leading opponent of income taxes and government ownership of public works and a proponent of careful indirect taxation.  His opposition to protective tariffs earned him the enmity of powerful politicians and journalists, like Horace Greeley, who eventually engineered his departure from Washington in 1869.  From his new perch in Connecticut, David Wells continued to sit on local and state revenue commissions and public works projects.  Wells was active in the American Social Science Association (ASSA) and served as its president from 1875 to 1879. In a bizarre 1889 book, David A. Wells betrayed his liberal instincts and began applauding monopolistic trust corporations as ""progress"".  Wells argued that ""excessive"" competition and the development of high finance has permitted American corporations to continue operating at a loss for years on end. As prices can remain below cost of production for extended periods of time, Wells speculated, this may result in chronic ""over-production"" in the economy.  Thus, by combining, monopolistic trusts can be said to have solved the over-production ""problem"" and restored ""normal"" profits.   He applauded trusts as the ""solution"" to economy-wide crises.  Wells had thus morphed from a classical liberal into a quintessential American apologist. David A.

H.G. Wells, 1866-1946 ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/hgwells.htm,"Famous British novelist Herbert George Wells (""H.G. Wells"") was also a evolutionary thinker and socialist activist.  Of working class origins, H.G. Wells managed to carve out an early career as a science teacher. Wells wrote his most famous novels of science fiction in the late 1890s.  Wells began to abandon science fiction after 1900, and turned to novels illustrative of working class and lower middle class life, which dovetailed into his increasing interest in socialism. A biologist by training, Wells nurtured an evolutionary theory of economic and social development and progress towards a human utopia. Seeing the evolutionary seed, H.G. Wells became a convert to the socialist. movement  and joined the  Fabian Society in 1903.  However, Wells eventually broke with the Fabians in 1909 on the issue of mass agitation (or rather lack of it).  Wells's Fabian period is parodied in his 1911 novel.  H.G. Wells articulated his evolutionary theory of history in his Outline of History (1920) Through much of his life, Wells delighted in authoring essays and books making forecasts of scientific, technological, political and social developments in the future, which have been retroactively hailed as prescient. His original forecasts (e.g. 1901) were usually optimistic, but with the arrival of the First World War, they became darker and more pessimistic.        Major Works of H.G.

Sir Edward F. West, 1782-1828.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/west.htm,"English lawyer, judge in India and briefly economist. The son of a receiver-general for Hertfordshire, he lost his father early and was raised by his uncle, a navy admiral.  Educated at Harrow and University College, Oxford, Edward West received his bachelor's degree in 1803 and M.A. in 1807, and thereafter resided as a Fellow of University College, Oxford, while studying for the bar.  He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1814 and quickly made a name for himself as a legal reformer. In 1815, at the recommendation of Henry Brougham, Edward West was roused to print (anonymously) during the debate over the Corn Laws.  In his celebrated Essay (1815), Edward West discovered the law of diminishing returns to land cultivation and the theory of differential rent (independently but simultaneously with Malthus, Ricardo and Torrens). Edward West married and was knighted in 1822, and subsequently sailed to India, arriving in February 1823, to serve as Recorder of the King's Bench in Bombay.  This was a crown court set up in 1799 with an eye to curb the excesses of the East India Company's government in India.  Edward West had frequent confrontations with the EIC governor Mounstuart Elphinstone. When the Supreme Court in Bombay was established in May 1824, Edward West was appointed its first chief justice. Despite his official duties, West found time in India to wrote a follow-up pamphlet on the Corn Laws, which were published in Britain in 1826, wherein West criticized the nascent ""wages fund"" doctrine. Edward West died prematurely on August 18, 1828 from a sudden illness.  His death was immediately followed tragically two weeks later by that of his wife, Lucretia Ffolkes, in childbirth. West's infant daughter, an orphan at birth, was to be raised by relatives.  There are no extant portraits of him.

Richard Whately, 1787-1863  ,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/whately.htm," Oxford logician, theologian, economist and Archbishop of Dublin. Richard Whately was educated in Bristol and Oriel College, Oxford, Whately was a leader of the ""Noetic"" generation at Oriel.  In 1811, Whately was engaged as a tutor to Nassau William Senior at Oxford, and forged a lifelong friendship and intellectual partnership.  Although the exact direction of influence is disputed, both shared a similar theoretical ""catallactic"" perspective of economics. Whately supported Senior's appointment to the Drummond Chair at Oxford in 1825, while Senior would contribute an appendix to Whately's Elements of Logic (1826). Whately's 1826 text was perhaps the first English treatise to provide a vigorous defense of logic as a field of study. His 1828 text on rhetoric was no less influential and continues to be read even today.  In 1831, he left Oxford to became the (Anglican) Archbishop of Dublin.  A proponent of liberal theology, Whately actively supported Catholic emancipation and the granting of civil rights to Jews.  An opponent of Ricardian theory, Whately's 1831 Lectures contained the rudiments of a subjective theory of value.  In opposition to the labor theory of value, Whately argued that, ""It is not that pearls fetch a high price because men have dived for them; but on the contrary, men dive for them because they fetch a high price.""  Whately also argued, famously, that economics be should be re-baptized as catallactics, the ""science of exchanges"".  Whately can be regarded the ""founder"" of the Oxford-Dublin school of proto-Marginalists.  In late 1831, Whately left Oxford to take up a new appointment as (Anglican) Archbishop of Dublin. 1832, he set up the Whately Chair in Political Economy at Trinity College, Dublin, which would later serve as a perch for other ""catallactic"" economists, such as Mountiford Longfield.    That same year, 1832, Whately helped found the commission of national education in Ireland.  Whately was de facto head and most influential member of the Board of National Education for many years (until his resignation in 1853)..

Wheatley articulated an early strict Quantity Theory of Money, Wheatley linked the the supply of money strictly to inflation and denied monetary expansion had any stimulative effects on industry.  Wheatley blamed the turn-of-the-century inflation on the excessive issue of banknotes by Bank of England. Wheatley is sometimes identified for developing the idea of an ""optimum"" quantity of money.

William Whewell, 1794-1866.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/whewell.htm," Cambridge polymath - mathematician, scientist, moral philosopher, theologian, educator and economist.  As one contemporary put it, ""science is his forte, omniscience is his foible"". William Whewell was born in Lancaster, the son of a carpenter. Young William's outstanding performance in his early schooling caught the attention of schoolmasters, and led his father to reluctantly consent to his further education, rather than apprenticing him off. After a period at grammar schools in Lancaster, topped off at Haversham school, William Whewell entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1812, where he would end up spending the rest of his life. Whewell made second wrangler and obtained his B.A. in 1816. After a period as a private tutor,. Whewell was elected fellow of Trinity College in 1817 and assistant tutor in mathematics. In his youth, Whewell drank deeply from continental sources - particularly the German philosophy of Immanuel Kant and the French mathematical science of Lagrange and Laplace. Cambridge, then still lumbering on with its Scholastic curriculum and bizarre Tripos, had fallen well behind. Early in his time at Cambridge, Whewell had met and befriended the astronomer John F.W. Herschel, Charles Babbage, George Peacock and the economist Richard Jones and several other bright lights. Whewell & Co. founded the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1819, with the goal of bringing modern continental science to Britain   Whewell's first textbook, Elementary Treatise on Mechanics (1819) imported the French analytical tradition, applying the new mathematics to other sciences.   Whewell was elected to the Royal Society in 1820, and became a lecturer in mathematics at Trinity. In 1825, William Whewell was ordained an Anglican priest.  That same year, the Cambridge chair in mineralogy fell vacant, and Whewell made his mind to compete for it.  He spent the next few years on long vacations in Germany studying the subject (as well as Gothic churches and Romantic literature, for which he maintained a lifelong devotion), and finally secured the position of professor of mineralogy at Cambridge in 1828.  Whewell promptly put out a small tract on mineralogy, but his next few years would be marked by an veritable explosion in productivity in other topics.  For economists, the most memorable was undoubtedly Whewell's ""Mathematical Exposition"", a series of essays read before the Cambridge Philosophical Society (1829, 1830) translating most of the extant Ricardian economic theory into mathematics. The endeavor was not warmly welcomed by many contemporaries, and Whewell exercise was partly polemical - to prove that Ricardo's theory was mistaken, that even accepting his premises, one reached the opposite conclusions.  Whewell showed the usefulness of mathematical methods, and expressed his confidence that mathematics could be applied as successfully to economics as to the physical mechanics.  But he also wanted to emphasize the problem of the premises. Mechanics was successful because it was careful with its premises, which it only established after much careful observation and experimentation.  Economists, by contrast, seem happy to pluck their assumptions from a priori reflection, speculation and slapdash simplification.  As a result, their premises were incomplete and inadequate, and so long as economists approached them that way, economics would remain far behind mechanics, no matter how much mathematics was thrown at it.  This latter observation had been impressed upon Whewell by Richard Jones.  Friends from their Cambridge days, Whewell and Jones had maintained a close intellectual relationship through the 1820s.  Jones, a thorough British empiricist to the bone, was always a little suspicious and occasionally impatient with Whewell's analytical proclivities.  Jones had always tried to curb Whewell's wide-eyed belief that the moral sciences, law even theology, could be reduced to a grand over-arching natural philosophy with the precision of mechanics. Jones impressed upon Whewell the importance of empirical facts in the construction of theory, and nudged Whewell in that direction.  In 1831, Jones wrote a blistering critique of the Ricardians, and added an barely-concealed condemnation of the logical-deductivist methodology espoused by the Catallacticists of Oxford.  In his (anonymous) review of Jones for the British Critic, Whewell joined in the fray. The collaboration with Jones on economics was vital in transitioning Whewell's perspective from analytical youth to mature empiricist  Whewell and Jones formed the kernel of what can be called the ""English Historical School"".  The Cambridge empiricist crew (Whewell, Jones, Babbage and, one might add the elderly Malthus) positioned themselves against both the abstractness of the Ricardians of London and the logical-deductivist Catallacticists of Oxford.   The collection of facts must precede the construction of theory, and to that end promoted the advance of data-collection and statistics.    Nonetheless, Whewell's attempts to fit mathematical demand curves to data and his derivation of an equilibrium in trade in a 1850 article  have led some to consider him a  proto-Marginalist.   Whewell was one of the founders of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) in 1831  Whewell invited the pioneering Belgian statistician Adolphe Quetelet to the BAAS meetings in Cambridge in 1832.  The Cambridge empiricist crew, led by Whewell, promptly persuaded the BAAS to add ""Section F"" (""Statistics"", soon to include ""Economic Science"") in 1833, the first open professional organization of economists in Britain. The same crew led the effort the next year to found the Statistical Society of London in 1834.  In 1833, Whewell contributed a notable essay on astronomy as part of the Bridgewater Treatises on natural theology.  Loosely, Whewell's basic argument was that knowledge of the world is acquired because there are ""fundamental"" and uniform laws of science which we are able to discover.   Whewell took this as evidence of the existence of a divinity to provide such uniformity.  These underlying scientific laws of the world are precisely the ""Ideas"" that God used in his creation of it.  Taking it a step further, Whewell went on to argue that science, by ""discovering"" these laws, was itself a providential task as it brought men closer to understanding the majesty of God's design. Whewell articulated his empiricist view of science more generally in his two monumental treatises, History of the Inductive Sciences (1837) and  Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences (1840)   Whewell is often regarded as the father of modern philosophy of science.  Whewell is best known for his theory of induction (which led up to a sharp debate with the more empirically-minded John Stuart Mill).  The ""sharing"" of human mind and physical phenomena was used by Whewell to argue that a priori ideas were necessarily ""true"" in an empirical sense.  Because mind and world are synchronized by the same principle, human intuition and empirical evidence tend to achieve the same results.  To use a famous example, Whewell did not accept that 2 + 1 = 3 on the grounds that it was a tautology (i.e. ""2 + 1 is the definition of 3"", as argued by Condillac and James Mill) nor because it was an empirical fact (""experience shows that a triple of things can be divided into a double and a single"", as argued by John Stuart Mill).  Instead, Whewell argued that because it is inconceivable to think that 2 + 1 is not equal to 3, therefore 2 + 1 = 3.  Empirical evidence merely confirms this natural intuition, but it is not the cause of it. Whewell was also an able pedagogue with an important role in reorganizing Trinity College, Cambridge. Whewell was critical in introducing the ""moral sciences"" and ""natural sciences"" examinations at Cambridge in 1848.  He was also notable wordsmith, e.g. the positive/negative charge language for electro-chemistry used since Faraday and even  the terms ""scientist"" and ""physicist"" in their modern meaning are originally due to Whewell.

Philip H. Wicksteed, 1844-1927.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/wicksteed.htm," English Unitarian minister, Dante scholar, early follower of Jevons, and propagator of the Marginalist Revolution. Philip H. Wicksteed was born in Leeds, the son of a Unitarian minister.  When Philip was ten, his family moved to a rural village in the Clwyd valley, near Bristol.  In 1860, Wicksteed transferred to University College School in London, enrolling, a year later, in University College itself.  After obtaining his B.A. from UCL in 1864, he went on to Manchester New College (London), receiving his MA in 1867.   In 1867, after finishing his studies in a competent, if not very distinguished, manner, Wicksteed joined the Unitarian ministry.  He took up his duties at Taunton, a small town in western England (Somerset).  In April, 1868, Philip Wicksteed married Emily Solly and, the next year, moved north, taking up duties as minister for the industrial parish of Dukinfield (near Manchester).  By personal observation, and through his parishioners, Wicksteed was immediately impressed by the hardships and fortunes of the industrial revolution and began, perhaps for the first time, to take an interest in economic matters.  Wicksteed encountered Auguste Comte's work around this time. But it was Biblical history that grabbed his principal intellectual attentions.  Wicksteed became enamored by the Dutch ""Historical-Critical"" school of Biblical studies, particularly the work of Abraham Kuenen.  He learnt Dutch in order to translate Oort's and Hooykaas's Bible for Young People into English.  In 1872, Wicksteed took the opportunity to spend a sojourn in the Netherlands, consulting with scholars of the Dutch school and attending lectures at the University of Leiden. He would repeat the pilgrimage in 1874.  Through his numerous translations and elucidating articles, Wicksteed quickly became the spokesman and popularizer of the Dutch school in England.  In 1874, Wicksteed left Dukinfield and moved to London, where he became minister of the Little Portland Street Chapel in the west end, succeeding his formidable old professor, James Martineau.  He would remain there for the next two decades. Wicksteed forged his life-long connection to the Medieval Florentine poet, Dante Alighieri, some time in the late 1870s.  It seemed a bit strange that the Dissenting preacher of an impatient west London congregation would take up this arcane topic, particularly given the association of Medievalism with nostalgic Neo-Catholicism and the ""Oxford movement"" fired up by John Henry Newman a few decades earlier.   But that was precisely Wicksteed's point: Dante was not merely a relic of Medieval Catholicism, but a living, human prophet-poet that transcended barriers of religion and time.  Without apology, Wicksteed delved into Dante.  Wicksteed's Six Sermons on Dante (1879) kicked off the life-long affair.   In 1879, Wicksteed came across Henry George's tract, Progress and Poverty, whose powerful condemnation of inequality and calls for reform were spreading quickly through the industrialized world.  Wicksteed sympathized immensely with its concerns, even if suspicious of George's simplistic analysis and solution.  But he did not know enough economics to judge. For help, Wicksteed turned to the English Historicist, Arnold Toynbee, and prevailed upon the latter to explain George to him.  But Toynbee's premature death in 1883 left Wicksteed without a mentor.  To replace him, Wicksteed searched around some more -- and found William Stanley Jevons. To our knowledge, Wicksteed and Jevons never met. Curiously, they followed the same academic path -- indeed they were contemporaries at UCL (although Jevons was nine years older). Both were deeply influenced by the same teachers along the way -- the logician Augustus de Morgan and the philosopher James Martineau.  In the 1870s, both Wicksteed and Jevons were living in London, not too far from each other, and being both Unitarians, it is probable that they moved in the same circles.  But if they met, no record of it remains.  All that is known is that Wicksteed acquired a copy of Jevons's Theory of Political Economy in 1882 -- the very same year Jevons died -- and read it carefully.  He was instantly converted to the Marginalist Revolution.  In 1883, a group of Unitarian students at Manchester New College approached Wicksteed and proposed the formation of study group to examine Henry George's doctrines.  Wicksteed agreed, on the condition that they take the trouble of working through Jevons first.  In 1884, Wicksteed's study group -- the ""Economic Circle"", as it was to become known -- transferred its meetings to the home of a Henry R. Beeton, a London stockbroker. Among those who joined the Circle were Henry S. Foxwell and Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, the two most prominent academic economists in London.  It is rumored that Alfred Marshall also joined the circle, although, being out of town, his participation was probably minimal, at best.  At any rate, in the hands of Wicksteed and Edgeworth, Henry George was soon set aside and the focus of the Circle's discussions swirled around  Jevonian economics. That same year, Wicksteed produced a review of yet another powerful book captivating the minds of young Londoners: Karl Marx's Das Kapital.  While applauding Marx's historical and social analysis, Wicksteed condemned the labor theory of value as illogical and incoherent, propounding, in its stead, the Jevonian theory.  The activist and playwright George Bernard Shaw took it upon himself to reply to Wicksteed -- not very successfully. Wicksteed's kind rejoinder was followed up by an invitation, and Shaw soon found himself in the Economic Circle, tutored in Jevonian economics by Wicksteed.  Three of the ""core"" members of the Fabian Society -- G.B. Shaw, Sidney Webb and Graham Wallas -- were also members of Wicksteed's Economic Circle. It is partly due to Wicksteed's tireless efforts that the Fabians abandoned dogmatic Marxism (the theory of value in particular), and came up with their own ""revisionist"" version of it.   The Economic Circle met from 1884 to 1888.  One of the outcomes of the discussion group was Wicksteed's Alphabet of Economic Science (1888), an attempt at an introductory-level exposition of Jevonian economics. It had all the virtues and faults of a self-educated economist. The Alphabet takes us through a tedious (if necessary) lesson in mathematics before getting to the economic meat.  Precisely-drawn diagrams and practical, numerical examples -- perhaps too many -- are inserted to illustrate every point.  There was little that is novel in it -- except perhaps for the first use of the term ""marginal utility"" in the English language (1888: p. 45) (Wieser used the term previously in German).  But its value lies precisely in in the detailed care with which it was written.   The Alphabet was really an introduction for the student who wishes to master the concepts, not so much for the impatient layman who merely wants to ""get"" the idea quickly, and so it was not as widely successful as Wicksteed had hoped.  In 1887, Wicksteed signed up as an University Extension lecturer, an activity which he would maintain tirelessly for much of the remainder of his life.  Extension lectures were organized by the traditional universities (Cambridge, Oxford, London, etc.) to deliver academic fare to the general English public.  The bulk of Wicksteed's lectures were on Dante, with occasional lectures of Wordsworth's poetry and Comte's sociology.  Later on, and ever more frequently, Wicksteed dedicated lectures to economics (folksily titled, ""Getting and Spending"", ""Making and Sharing""), channeling Jevonian economics with the same kind of real-life practical examples that he had employed in his Alphabet.  Towards the end of his life, Wicksteed added the Greek tragedies to his repertoire.  But Dante remained, throughout, the principal topic.  As G.B. Shaw quipped, ""Economics was his hobby; Dante was his job."". Wicksteed had briefer, but also keen, interest in other literary figures. He never abandoned Wordsworth, the bard of his youth.  Wicksteed took up an interest in the playwright Henrik Ibsen as a result of his yearly vacations to the Norwegian fjords (a custom he commenced in 1878). Perhaps a bit prematurely, Wicksteed sought to introduce the English public to Ibsen's work in a series of public lectures (1888). Also curious was Wicksteed's translation, largely for a lark, of the Medieval tale, Our Lady's Tumbler (1894).  This turned out to be the most popular of his publications.  In 1894, Wicksteed returned to economics and produced his revolutionary treatise, An Essay on the Coordination of the Laws of Distribution (1894).  In its precisely-argued, densely-written pages, Wicksteed revealed his Marginal Productivity Theory of Distribution, which was to become one of the cornerstones of Neoclassical economics.  He would eventually have to share the laurels with other independent discovers -- John Bates Clark and Knut Wicksell, for instance.     All this had arisen in response to the Henry George movement. The Georgists drew on the Ricardian notion that land was the sole residual earner.  Their indignation at inequality and poverty was channeled into a furor against landlords and their ""unearned"" rents.  Georgist policy propositions invariably involved the seizure of rents and/or land.  Some economists, such as Walker and Hobson, had already replied by insisting that land was not ""special"", that earnings on land were like earnings on any other factor. They had proposed that the Ricardian ""law of rent"" applied to all factors, and not merely land,  e.g. reversing the Ricardian exercise,  if we hold labor fixed and vary the quantity of land, then the quantity of land will be set where its earnings are equal to its marginal product -- and labor's wages can be deduced from the residual.   This intrigued Wicksteed whom, as we have already seen, was intensely (if critically) interested in the Henry George movement and articulated the same argument about the ""non-specialness"" of land in the 1894 Essay.  But Wicksteed's main contribution to this generalization of the law of rent was to show that if every factor was paid its marginal product, we would find that there is no residual earner because the entire output will be exhausted.  This ""product-exhaustion"" proposition  is the essence of the Marginal Productivity Theory of Distribution.  More succinctly, proposing a production function of the sort Y = f(K, L, T), where K is capital, L is labor and T is land (incidentally, Wicksteed may be properly credited for introducing the now common notion of the single-output, multiple-input ""production function""). If the factors are paid their marginal products, the earnings of capital are fKK, those of labor fLL and those of land, fTT (where fi is the marginal product of the ith factor).  Wicksteed's thesis was that, upon summation, we will find that Y =  fKK + fLL +  fTT, no more and no less. Wicksteed was bedazzled by his own result and proclaimed that it applied universally: ""Our law then may be regarded as perfectly general....In this form, it is not a theory of distribution, but an analytical and synthetical law of composition and resolution of industrial factors and products, which would hold equally in Robinson Crusoe's island, an American religious commune, in an Indian village ruled by custom, and in competitive centres of the typical modern industries."" (P.H. Wicksteed, 1894: p.42). But other economists begged to differ.  Pareto and Edgeworth, for instance, pointed out that the product exhaustion thesis only applied if the production function (f(,)) was linearly homogeneous, i.e. had constant returns to scale throughout.  Yet, in economic systems with some degree of monopoly or indivisibilities in production, we would have differing returns to scale.   Wicksteed was aware of this, but came up with a rather contrived ""change-of-variables"" argument to show that any production system can be ""made"" linearly homogeneous, i.e. that if we consider every type of every factor as ""unique"" then ""on this understanding it is of course obvious that a proportional increase in all factors of production will secure a proportional increase in output"" (Wicksteed, 1894: p.33).  His critics didn't let this legerdemain pass and Wicksteed withdrew the claim in his later statements of the theory. It was left for Walras and Wicksell to point out that perfect competition was a sufficient condition for constant returns to scale, something that had not quite occurred to Wicksteed.  On an additional note, Wicksteed achieved his result by detailed mathematical arguments and demonstrations.  A.W. Flux, in reviewing Wicksteed's Essay (for the Economic Journal, 1894), pointed out that Wicksteed's efforts would have been much less painful if he realized that he was just ""rediscovering"" a standard mathematical result known as Euler's Theorem, i.e. that any linear homogeneous function can be expressed as the summation of its arguments multiplied by their first derivatives. Although Wicksteed's Essay served as a ""counterblast"" to Georgist analysis, his sympathy for its reformist message continued and he became increasingly active in social reform movements.  He was particularly keen on finding their points of contact with theology. In the 1890s, Wicksteed was invited to join a group of like-minded, middle class ""liberal-modernist"" Unitarians, and served as the warden of University Hall, their chief meeting place, during its short existence.  In 1892,  Wicksteed decided to reach out more directly to the working classes and helped start the ""Labour Church"" movement, but that failed too.  Later, his efforts became more disparate.  Domestically, he attached himself closely to the anti-vivisection movement and a host of other petty causes.  He was particularly vocal on foreign issues that tended to be overlooked, e.g. raising awareness of Armenian and Greek victims of Ottoman massacres and the British-run opium trade in China. Most notably, perhaps because of his Dutch connection, Wicksteed spoke up for the Boers in the early days of their uprising and, defying the jingoism of his day, was a loud and consistent critic of the Anglo-Boer War.   In 1897, nostalgic for country life, Wicksteed and his family moved out of London and settled in the rustic village of Childrey (in Berkshire, west of London).  Although no longer an active minister, Wicksteed continue to criss-cross England as an Extension lecturer and remained semi-involved in several activist causes.  In the late 1890s, Wicksteed laid economics aside and returned to Dante.   Wicksteed's fascination with the poet had increased after a pilgrimage to Dante's hometown of Florence in 1895.  Now, in the comfort of the Berkshire countryside, Wicksteed went through the labors of translating and annotating Dante's De Monarchia (1896), correspondence (1898), the Divine Comedy (1899-1901),  Convivio (1903), Eclogues (1904), Canzionere (1906), etc. This period of Dante activity was crowned by his superb address, The Religion of Time and the Religion of Eternity (1899), summarizing Dante's significance for the modern world. After this Dante phase, Wicksteed returned to economics, setting himself to writing a more comprehensive thesis.  The outcome was the massive Common Sense of Political Economy (1910).  This treatise was faithfully of the Jevonian school, although with some ingredients were drawn from the Lausanne economics of Vilfredo Pareto, with which he had recently become acquainted (see Wicksteed's 1906 review of Pareto).  Wicksteed's Common Sense was intended as a textbook, to compete head-on with Alfred Marshall's Principles and dislodge the Marshallian orthodoxy -- that ""school of apologists"", as Wicksteed (1905) called them -- which had since, the 1890s, acquired a near-monopoly over English economics.  After the introductory chapter, the Common Sense leaps into a discussion of individual choice (Chapter II). Wicksteed drops the utility function in favor of ""relative scale of preference"" (a concept borrowed from Pareto) and uses it to illustrate ""diminishing psychic returns"" and how they guide household choice.    Happily, there is no cumbersome ""mathematical chapter"" that needs to be read first.   But it is written in the same systematic and precise (if plodding) care as his previous works (the detailed numerical examples get so involved that Wicksteed helpfully provides fold-outs to see them clearly).  In Chapter III, Wicksteed tries to anticipate practically all possible objections and exceptions to this theory. In standard Jevonian sequence, Wicksteed proceeds to discuss exchange between trading bodies in Chapter IV -- alas, here, where detailed examples are perhaps most needed, they are largely missing.  Production is unveiled as merely indirect exchange and money as ""exchange at two removes"".  Objections and exceptions are, once again, noted and anticipated. In Chapter V, Wickseed steps back to reflect on ""scope"" of  the theory of exchange in modern society. It is commonly assumed that this chapter derives from Wicksteed's early interest in Comte, but Pareto's influence is perhaps even more evident. The object is not to extend, but rather to limit, the applicability of the theory. He plunges into an interesting discussion of ""economic motive"", arguing that rarely, if ever, can any person's actions be reduced to it. It is merely one motive among many. But whenever people enter into ""economic relations"" (for whatever motivation), this is where the laws of economics are applicable.  In short, economics deals with a facet of behavior in the social context of an economic relation, not a type of behavior which may be exhibited in isolation or in other social contexts.  In the next three chapters (VI, VII and VIII), Wicksteed proceeds to survey the nuts and bolts of ""markets"", the ""machinery"" by which exchange equilibrium is established.  Following up on the previous chapter, he is careful not to fetishize it.  The market is not some evanescent harmonious being doing great good (or great harm, for that matter) on its own.  It is an ""ethically-indifferent instrument"" (p.184), that is all. It is merely ""the machinery by which those on whose scale of preference any commodity is relatively high are brought into communication with those on whose scales it is relative low, in order that exchanges may take place to mutual satisfaction until equilibrium is established"" (Wicksteed, 1910: p.236). In these chapters, prices are not merely incidental rates of exchange, but given an institutional life of their own -- prices ""on the market"".  It is the closest thing to demand-and-supply theory Wicksteed dares essay, but the concept is deliberately eschewed.  He remains consistently Jevonian, always operating with two trading bodies for every pair of goods, emphasizing that there are demanders on both sides of the market.  There is also no magical auctioneer ""adjusting prices"" in the background either.  Exactly how an equilibrium is established depends on the particular institutional structure of that particular market. Wicksteed feels it necessary to survey different types of markets (e.g. futures, stock markets, auctions, oriental bazaars, markets for raw materials) and touches on all sorts of  institutional features which affect how they operate (competition, speculation, sticky prices, dumping, monopolies, etc.).  Interestingly, Wicksteed refers not to ""wrong prices"", but rather to ""wrong estimates of prices"" by the participants, as the principle driver of adjustments -- the sort of mechanism made popular in the non-tatonnement literature of the 1960s (e.g. Hahn, Negishi, Uzawa).   Still in the context of the market surveys, Chapter VII is notable for adopting Jevons's conception of time and analyzing interest in the context of markets for ""anticipations of wealth"".  Chapter VIII focuses on the ""market for services"" (i.e. labor), particularly emphasizing how wages depend ultimately on the scarcity of consumer goods (the imputation theorem).  He takes a few asides to pursue the ethical and political implications of this. In Chapter IX, Wicksteed restates his celebrated theory of distribution.  Production theory is covered in detail first, more so than in the 1894 Essay and it is evident that he adapts much from Pareto here.  The Jevonian precepts on production are dropped as Wicksteed embraces the Paretian notion of a price-taking entrepreneur making decisions about factor combinations (p.362)  This completes Book I, the ""systematic"" part of the Common Sense.  Book II - which he calls ""excursive and critical"" - is reserved for that long-dreaded lesson in the mathematics of curve-fitting and diminishing slopes.  In Ch.3 he reiterates the subjective nature of utility curves - or as he now prefers to call it, ""total satisfaction"", and provides a cautious, if awkward, explanation on the use of community utility curves (""not susceptible of psychic interpretation...though they rest on a psychic basis"", p.489).  Ch.4 sets out his demonstration of supply as inverse demand, deriding the Marshallian scissors as ""illusory"".  Ch.6 on diminshing and increasing returns contains his all-out assault on the upward-sloping supply curve.  Ch.7 on rent attacks the residual theory, showing rent is not special - ""everything we read in economics books as to the pure theory of distribution, whether it refers to wages, interest, rent or profit, is either false when asserted of the category under discussion, or else true of all the others as well"" (p.574).  Bk II ends with Ch.6 on banking and currrency. Book III of the Common Sense - what he calls ""analytical and practical"" - is the applied economics chapters.  There's only a couple of chapters here - covering a variety of Wicksteed's favorite topics.  Gambling and insurance, housing (identifying it as part of the general poverty problem, and warning of the dangers of excessive housing codes), unemployment (dependent on product demand, relieved by labor mobility and aggravated by minimum wage legislation), commercial crisis (brought about by general optimistic expectations, not quite ""overproduction"" is merely lack of business confidence, encourages government public works), tariff reform (dismisses protectionism as merely driven by nationalism rather than economic sense),  impact of charity (example of Indian famine relief), measures of national income and inequality.

Friedrich von Wieser, 1851-1926.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/wieser.htm," Friedrich von Wiser was a prominent and leading member of the first generation of Carl Menger's Austrian School - together with Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, his close friend, colleague and, brother-in-law. Friedrich von Wieser was born in Vienna in 1851 to a notable family of Austrian government officials.  His father Leopold von Wieser had been a privy councilor to the Hapsburg emperor Franz Josef since 1858, and ennobled as a hereditary baron in 1889 (""Freiherr von Wieser"") . Friedrich von Wieser enrolled at the University of Vienna in 1868 to study law, obtaining his degree in 1872.  An early attraction to history and sociology (from reading Spencer) had given way in the course of his studies to an interest in economics.  Although his original economics teachers (notably Lorenz von Stein) left him cold, Wieser was converted and spellbound after the appearance of Carl Menger's  Grundsätze in 1871.  In 1875, Wieser obtained an academic scholarship for a tour of study at Heidelberg, Jena and Leipzig, where Wieser (together with fellow student Böhm-Bawerk)  were exposed to the to the German Historical School - attending lectures by Knies at Heidelberg, Roscher at Leipzig and Hildebrand at Jena.  Nonetheless, both Wieser and Böhm-Bawerk remained steadfastly by Menger's marginalism. After a brief period in the Austrian civil service, Wieser returned to academia in 1883, submitting his habilitation and becoming privatdozent at the University of Vienna.  The very next year (1884), he became extraordinary professor at the University of Prague.  Wieser obtained the full professorial chair in economics at Prague in 1889, coming out with his main work, Natural Value, that same year.  Wieser became rector at Prague in 1901.  In 1903, Friedrich von Wieser returned to succeed Carl Menger in the professorial chair at the University of Vienna.  Wieser and Bohm-Bawerk groomed the next generation of Austrians (which included L.von Mises, F.A. Hayek and J.A. Schumpeter) at Vienna in the early 1900s.  Although famous for his detached Olympian demeanor throughout his life, Wieser eventually entered the Austrian political arena in 1917, being a member of the upper house of the Austrian parliament, and briefly serving as minister of trade in the last Austro-Hungarian imperial government.  Returning to academia after the war, Wieser retired in 1923, securing the appointment of Hans Mayer as the successor to his academic chair in Vienna. Wieser's two main contributions are the theory of ""imputation"", establishing that factor prices are determine by output prices (rather than the other way around, as the Classicals had it) and the theory of ""alternative cost"" or ""opportunity cost"" as the foundation of value theory -- fundamental ""subjectivist"" pillars in Neoclassical theory which were being effectively ignored by Marshall and the ""real cost"" British theorists. In developing these ideas, Wieser can be credited with turning Neoclassical economics firmly towards the study of scarcity and resource allocation - a fixed quantity of resources and unlimited wants - all based on the principle of marginal utility. Menger had initially set this up, but never really extended it to production and factors properly. Wieser's imputation theory allowed that single principle to be applied everywhere. Wieser's theory of alternative cost and Marshall's ""real cost"" theory came into confrontation quickly - Wicksteed and Edgeworth duelled on a version of this, as later did Robbins, Knight and Viner - but today they can be said to be reconciled (for the most part). This was largely achieved by the insights provided by modern linear programming and general equilibrium theory. Wieser is renowned for two main works, Natural Value (1889), which carefully details the alternative cost doctrine and the theory of imputation, and his Social Economics (1914), an ambitious attempt at a comprehensive restatement of Austrian theory as a whole, and its application to the real world.

Walter F. Willcox, 1861-1864,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/willcox.htm,"American Institutionalist, statistician and demographer at Cornell.  Walter Francis Willcox was born in Reading, Massachusetts, the son of a Congregationalist minister. Willcox was educated at the Philips Academy in Andover, and went on to obtain his B.A. from Amherst College in 1884, an LL.B. from Columbia in 1887 and an MA from Amherst in 1888. Like many Americans of the post-bellum ""new generation"", Willcox went for graduate study abroad in Germany, spending 1889-90 at the University of Berlin.  Originally intending to study philosophy and law, it was in Berlin,  then a bastion of the Historical School, that Willcox first encountered statistical methods and converted to empiricism (the work of the French statistician Jacques Bertillon is often cited as his main influence), Upon his return, Willcox received a Ph.D. from Columbia in 1891, with a dissertation on the demographics of divorce in the United States.  Walter F. Willcox subsequently joined the faculty of Cornell University as philosophy instructor, but was promptly appointed assistant in social science and statistics. In 1892, Willcox introduced one of the first courses in statistics at an American university - initially under the title of ""Applied Ethics"", later ""Social Statistics"" - which would became a mainstay for several generations of Cornell students.  Willcox served a stint (1899-1901) as one of the chief statisticians of the US Bureau of the Census.  He helped conduct the 1899 censuses of Puerto Rico and Cuba, and the Twelfth Census of the United States in 1900.  Some of Willcox's work has not dated well.  Most notably, Willcox's dubious studies on African-Americans, replete with statistics and the appearance of scientific objectivity, gave wind to the sails of notorious white supremacists like Alfred Holt Stone (to whom Willcox was close),  William B. Smith and Mississippi governor James K. Vardaman.  Much cited were Willcox's claims on the ""Negro's liability to criminality"" and his ""extinction hypothesis"" (that the Black race was so decrepit, its population would decline and eventually become extinct). Willcox's methods and hypotheses were famously disputed by W.E.B. DuBois, and a blistering correspondence between the two men ensued, in which Willcox declared himself ""agnostic"" on the causes of the predicament of Blacks in America. Willcox becoming full professor of economics and statistics at Cornell in 1901. He would remain at Cornell for the remainder of his career,  until his retirement in 1931. Willcos was still a regular presence on the Cornell campus and active in political debates for decades thereafter   He died at the advanced age of 104.      Major Works of Walter F.

William of Auxerre, c.1150-1231.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/auxerre.htm,"A Scholastic theologian at Paris, sometimes also called William of Beauvais.  He is not to be confused with his contemporary, the similar-sounding William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris. William of Auxerre was a master in Paris and archdeacon of Beauvais.  In 1230, William of Auxerre was dispatched to Rome to Pope Gregory IX to reach a resolution between the city of Paris and the university after the student strike of 1229, that eventually resulted in the Parens scientiarum decree of 1231, establishing the independence of the university under papal protection. In 1231, Gregory IX appointed William of Auxerre at the head of a commission of three theologians (the others were Simon of Authie and Stephen of Provins, both canons of Rheims) to examine and ""correct"" the corpus of Aristotle and his Arab commentators (which had been banned at the university of Paris since 1210) and extirpate dangerous passages.  The work of the committee was never completed, as William died shortly after. William of Auxerre's principal work, the Summa Aurea, was a commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, that was an important precursor to Aquinas.  It contains an ample disquisition on usury and the natural law basis of economic matters.       Major Works of William of Auxerre Resources on William of Auxerre All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

John Burr Williams, 1902-1989,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/schools/finance.htm#williams," Finance theory has a surprisingly short history in economics.   Economists have long been aware of the basic economic function of credit markets but they were not keen on analyzing it much further than that.  As such, early ideas about financial markets were largely intuitive, mostly formulated by practitioners.   Pioneering theoretical work on financial markets, notably that of Louis Bachelier (1900), tended to be basically ignored by theoreticians and practitioners alike. Portfolio Theory This does not mean that the early economists ignored financial markets.   Henry C. Emery (1896) and Irving Fisher (1906, 1907, 1930) had already outlined the basic functions of credit markets for economic activity --  specifically as a way of allocating resources over time.  Both had recognized the role of risk in the process and the importance of speculative activity in risk-bearing and channeling information through prices.  In developing their theories of money, John Maynard Keynes (1930, 1936), John Hicks (1934, 1935, 1939), Nicholas Kaldor (1939) and Jacob Marschak (1938) had already conceived of portfolio selection theory in which uncertainty played an important role.   However, for many economists during this early period, financial markets were still regarded as mere ""casinos"" rather than ""markets"" properly speaking.   In their view, asset prices were determined largely by expectations and counter-expectations of capital gains and thus they were ""held up by their own bootstraps"" as it were.  John Maynard Keynes's ""beauty contest"" analogy is representative of this attitude.   As such, a good amount of ink was spent on the topic of speculative activity (i.e. the purchase/temporary sale of goods or assets for later resale), a topic first brought up into serious discussion by Henry C. Emery (1896).  In their pioneering work on futures markets, John Maynard Keynes (1923, 1930) and John Hicks (1939)  argued that the price of  a futures contract for delivery of a commodity will be generally below the expected spot price of that commodity (what Keynes called ""normal backwardation"").  This, Keynes and Hicks argued, was largely because hedgers shifted their price risk onto speculators in return for a risk premium.  Nicholas Kaldor (1939) went on to analyze the question of whether speculation was successful in stabilizing prices and, in so doing, expanded Keynes's theory of liquidity preference considerably.  (In later years, Holbrook Working (1953, 1962)  would dispute this, arguing that there was, in fact, no difference between the motivations of hedgers and speculators.  This led to an early empirical race -- Hendrik Houthakker (1957, 1961, 1968, 1969) finding evidence in favor of normal backwardation and Lester Telser (1958, 1981) finding evidence against it.) John Burr Williams (1938) was among the first to challenge the ""casino"" view economists held of financial markets and questions of asset pricing.  He argued that asset prices of financial assets reflected the ""intrinsic value"" of an asset, which can be measured by the discounted stream of future expected dividends from the asset.   This ""fundamentalist"" notion fit well with Irving Fisher's (1907, 1930) theory, and the ""value-investing"" approach of practitioners such as Benjamin Graham.    Harry Markowitz (1952, 1959) realized that as the ""fundamentalist"" notion relied on expectations of the future, then the element of risk must come into play and thus profitable use could be made of the newly developed expected utility theory of John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern (1944).  Markowitz formulated the theory of optimal portfolio selection in the context of trade-offs between risk and return, focusing on the idea of portfolio diversification as a method of reducing risk -- and thus began what has become known as ""Modern Portfolio Theory"" or simply MPT. As noted, the idea of an optimal portfolio allocation had already been considered by Keynes, Hicks and Kaldor in their theories of money, and thus it was a logical step for James Tobin (1958) to add money to Markowitz's story and thus obtain the famous ""two-fund separation theorem"".  Effectively, Tobin argued that agents would diversify their savings between a risk-free asset (money) and a single portfolio of risky assets (which would be the same for everyone).  Different attitudes towards risk, Tobin contended, would merely result in different combinations of money and that unique portfolio of risky assets. The Markowitz-Tobin theory was not very practical.  Specifically, to estimate the benefits of diversification would require that practitioners calculate the covariance of returns between every pair of assets.  In their Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), William Sharpe (1961, 1964) and John Lintner (1965) solved this practical difficulty by demonstrating that one could achieve the same result merely by calculating the covariance of every asset with respect to a general market index.   With the necessary calculating power reduced to computing these far fewer terms (""betas""), optimal portfolio selection became computationally feasible.   It was not long before practitioners embraced the CAPM. The CAPM would be eventually challenged empirically in a series of papers by Richard Roll (1977, 1978). One of the alternatives offered up was the ""intertemporal CAPM"" (ICAPM) of Robert Merton (1973).  Merton's approach and the assumption of rational expectations led the way to the Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1985) partial differential equation for asset prices and, perhaps only a step away, Robert E. Lucas's (1978) theory of asset pricing. A more interesting alternative was the ""Arbitrage Pricing Theory"" (APT) of Stephen A. Ross (1976).  Stephen  Ross's APT approach moved away from the risk vs. return logic of the CAPM, and exploited the notion of ""pricing by arbitrage"" to its fullest possible extent.  As Ross himself has noted, arbitrage-theoretic reasoning is not unique to his particular theory but is in fact the underlying logic and methodology of virtually all of finance theory.  The following famous financial theorems illustrate Ross's point. The famous theory of option pricing by Fisher Black and Myron Scholes (1973) and  Robert Merton (1973) relies heavily on the use of arbitrage reasoning.  Intuitively, if the returns from an option can be replicated by a portfolio of other assets, then the value of the option must be equal to the value of that portfolio, or else there will be arbitrage opportunities.   Arbitrage logic was also used by M. Harrison and David M. Kreps (1979) and Darrell J. Duffie and Chi-Fu Huang (1985) to value multi-period (i.e. ""long-lived"") securities. All this spills over into the Neo-Walrasian theories of   general equilibrium with asset markets (complete and incomplete) developed by Roy Radner (1967, 1968, 1972), Oliver D. Hart (1975) and many others since.   The famous Modigliani-Miller theorem (or ""MM"") on the irrelevance of corporate financial structure for the value of the firm also employs arbitrage logic.   This famous theorem Franco Modigliani and Merton H. Miller (1958, 1963) can actually be thought of as an extension of the  ""Separation Theorem"" originally developed by Irving Fisher (1930).  Effectively, Fisher had argued that with full and efficient capital markets, the production decision of an entrepreneur-owned firm ought to be independent of the intertemporal consumption decision of the entrepreneur himself.  This translates itself into saying that the profit-maximizing production plan of the firm will not be affected by the borrowing/lending decisions of its owners, i.e. the production plan is independent of the financing decision.  Modigliani-Miller extended this proposition via arbitrage logic. Viewing firms as assets, if the underlying production plans of differently-financed firms are the same, then the market value of the firms will be the same for, if not, there is an arbitrage opportunity there for the taking.   Consequently, arbitrage enforces that the value of the firms to be identical, whatever the composition of the firm's financial structure.   Efficient Markets Hypothesis The second important strand of work on finance was the empirical analysis of asset prices.  A particularly disturbing finding was that it seemed that prices tended to follow a random walk.   More specifically, as documented already by Louis Bachelier (1900) (for commodity prices) and later confirmed in further studies by Holbrook Working (1934) (for a variety of price series), Alfred Cowles (1933, 1937) (for American stock prices) and Maurice G. Kendall (1953) (for British stock and commodity prices), it seemed as there was no correlation between successive price changes on asset markets. The Working-Cowles-Kendall  empirical findings were greeted with horror and disbelief by economists.  If prices are determined by the ""forces of supply and demand"", then price changes should move in particular direction towards market clearing and not randomly.   Not everyone was displeased with these results, however.  Many viewed them as proof that the ""fundamentalist"" theory was incorrect, i.e. that financial markets really were wild casinos and that finance was thus not a legitimate object of economic concern.  Yet others crowed that it proved the failure of  traditional ""statistical"" methods to illuminate much of anything.   High-powered time series methods were used by Clive Granger and Oskar Morgenstern (1963) and Eugene F. Fama (1965, 1970), but they came up with the same randomness result. The great breakthrough was due to Paul A. Samuelson (1965) and Benoit Mandelbrot (1966).  Far from proving that financial markets did not work according to the laws of economics, Samuelson interpreted the Working-Cowles-Kendall findings as saying that they worked all too well!  The basic notion was simple: if price changes were not random (and thus forecastable), then any profit-hungry arbitrageur can easily make appropriate purchases and sales of assets to exploit this.  Samuelson and Mandelbrot thus posited the celebrated ""Efficient Market Hypothesis"" (EMH): namely, if markets are working properly, then all public (and, in some versions, private) information regarding an asset will be channelled immediately into its price. (note that the term ""efficient"", as it is used here, merely means that agents are making full use of the information available to them; it says nothing about other types of ""economic efficiency"", e.g. efficiency in the allocation of  resources in production, etc.).   If price changes seem random and thus unforecastable it is because  investors are doing their jobs: all arbitrage opportunities have already been exploited to the extent to which they can be. The ""Efficient Markets Hypothesis"" was made famous by Eugene Fama (1970) and later connected to the rational expectations hypothesis of New Classical macroeconomics.   It did not please many practioners.  ""Technical"" traders or ""chartists"" who believed they could forecast asset prices by examining the patterns of price movements were confounded: the EMH told them that they could not ""beat the market"" because any available information would already be incorporated in the price.  It also had the potential to annoy some fundamentalist practioners: the idea of efficient markets rests on ""information"" and ""beliefs"", and thus does not, at least in principle, rule out the possibility of speculative bubbles based on rumor, wrong information and the ""madness of crowds"". More disturbingly, the EMH has not pleased economists. EMH is probably one of the more resiliant empirical propositions around (albeit, see Robert Shiller's (1981) critique), yet it does not seem to have a clearly sound theoretical standing.  It all seems to collapse on one particular objection: namely, that if all information is already contained in prices and investors are fully rational, then not only can one not profit from using one's information, indeed, there might not be any trade at all! These peculiar, contradictory implications of rational expectations were demonstrated by Sanford J. Grossman and Joseph E. Stiglitz (1980) and Paul Milgrom and Nancy Stokey (1982).  Intuitively, the objection can be put this way (and here we are oversimplifying a bit).  The efficient markets hypothesis effectively implies that there is ""no free lunch"", i.e. there are no $100 bills lying on the pavement because, if there were, someone would have picked them up already.  Consequently, there is no point in looking down at the pavement (especially if there is a cost to looking down).  But if everyone reasons this way, no one looks down at the pavement, then any $100 bills that might be lying there will not be picked up by anyone.   But then there are $100 bills lying on the pavement and one should look down.  But then if everyone realizes that, they will look down and pick up the $100 bills, and thus we return to the first stage and argue that there are not any $100 bills (and therefore no point in looking down, etc.)  This circularity of reasoning is what makes the theoretical foundations of the efficient markets hypothesis somewhat shaky.

Thomas Wilson, 1525-1581.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/thomaswilson.htm,"16th Century Tudor state official, Protestant humanist, logician and rhetorician. Educated at King's College, Cambridge. receiving his M.A. in 1549, and went on to serve as  tutor in the household of the Duchess of Suffolk, and coming into the circle of John Dudley (Earl of Warwick, future Duke of Northumberland).  He rose in status when Dudley seized control of the regency for young Edward VI away from Somerset in 1549.  Thomas Wilson fled England in 1553, after he was implicated in Northumberland's failed coup to keep the Catholic queen Mary I from ascending to the throne. Wilson spent most of exile residing in northern Italy (notably Ferrara and Padua.  Wilson returned to England after 1560, and became an Elizabethan official, judge in the Court of Requests and privy councilor.  He would serve as a diplomat to Portugal and the Netherlands.  Thomas Wilson is best known to economist for his Discourse on Usury (pub. 1572, but written years earlier).  Wilson sets out the issue of usury in the manner of a dialogue between a parson, a doctor, a lawyer and a merchant. Wilson defends the religious laws against usury, categorically declaring it sinful.  Although the protagonists agree, they make note that ""trade is one thing, religion another"". Wilson goes on to consider various other economic issues of the day, condemning commerce, the Fuggers, the Antwerp exchange, enclosures, the sturdy beggar, etc. as endangering the stability and welfare of the kingdom.  In that respect, Wislon's Discourse is a one of the first tracts against creeping capitalism that goes beyond religious strictures.

Gerrard Winstanley, 1609-1676.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/winstanley.htm," English Protestant merchant, divine and early proponent of Christian communism.  Winstanley was a leader of ultra-egalitarian ""Diggers"" movement that sprung up briefly in the anarchy of republican England in 1649-51.  A merchant ruined by the Civil Wars, Gerrard Winstanley took to the pen in 1648 and authored a series of tracts, most notably the New Law of Righteousness, published in early 1649  Drawing extensively on the Bible, particularly the New Testament, Winstanley decried the enclosures, declared private property to be contrary to Christian teachings, or, at any rate, a ""foreign"" innovation introduced by Normans, contravening the ancient rights of Englishmen.  In 1649, Winstanley organized the Diggers movement - or, as they called themselves, the ""True Levellers"" (in contrast with John Lilburne's army-based Leveller movement).  In April 1649, a group of Diggers led by Winstanley occupied common land on St. George's Hill in Weybridge, Surrey, which they proceeded to plant and distribute food freely, inviting others to join them (from which were issued the two Digger manifestoes). The Diggers envisioned tearing down social hierarchy and economic inequality by pursuing a rural idyll of agrarian communism, without property, prices, wages or commercial exchange.  The commune was attacked by local landlords, hit with lawsuits and finally broken up by the army by August 1649.  Further occupations were attempted elsewhere. But the opposition of local landlords was stiff and by 1651, all the remaining Digger communes, never very large to begin with, had dissolved.  Winstanley's Law of Freedom, his final attempt to appeal to Oliver Cromwell to institute the Digger philosophy in the Commonwealth, gives the most extensive account of the utopian Digger vision. Winstanley later briefly joined up with the Quakers and eventually resumed business in London.

Hermann Wold, 1908-1992,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/wold.htm," Norwegian-born Swedisih econometrician and statistician whose work on time series and recursive systems is well known.  Herman Ole Andreas Wold is perhaps most famous for the ""Wold decomposition""  separating stationary time series into a deterministic component and  random component.  He introduced this theorem in his 1938 thesis at Stockholm University (Ragnar Frisch, one of the examiners, disputed it vigorously in the thesis defense). Wold stayed on at Stockholm University until 1942, when he was appointed professor of statistics at Uppsala, where he would remain until 1970, rounding off his career at Gothenburg. Hermann Wold's work on the methodology of econometrics, in particular the issue of causality and identification (e.g. 1954, 1956, 1963, 1982), are also important contributions. One of Wold's best known pieces remains his 1943-4 series of articles on ""Pure Demand Analysis"", which synthesizes and integrates the various strands of preference-based demand theory into the comprehensive Neoclassical theory we are familiar with today. Wold is also celebrated for have introduced the ""partial least squares"" (PLS) method in 1966.  Although its early applications were mostly in chemical sciences, it has since become part of the toolkit of social scientists.

Xenophon, 420?-355? BC.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/xenophon.htm," Ancient Athenian scholar, sometimes called the first economist.  Xenophon is regarded as one of the few primary contemporary sources on Socrates. Xenophon was an Athenian aristocrat by birth. In his early life, Xenophon was a  pupil of Socrates (whose character he records in the Memorabilia and the Apologia).  Xenophon's Symposium covers roughly the same ground as Plato's dialogue of the same name, albeit focusing more on the wit than the philosophy of love.   It is regarded by some as a parody of Plato's dialogue, or as a source of it inspiration. Xenophon was part of the famous Greek hoplite mercenary army (the ""Ten Thousand""), hired by the Persian prince Cyrus the Younger, then strap of Lydia, that set out in 401 BCE on a campaign to seize the throne of his elder brother, the great king Atarxerxes II of Persia.  The Greek mercenaries defeated the royal Persian army at the Battle of Cunaxa (near Babylon). However Cyrus was killed in action, leaving the Greek mercenaries stranded in the heart of Persian Mesopotamia without an employer. Deep in hostile lands, the Greek mercenary corps (who elected Xenophon as one of their commanders) had to make their way out the Persian empire and back home.   Xenophon gives a detailed account of the celebrated retreat in his Anabasis. Xenophon, an Athenian, grew familiar with Spartans in the ranks of this mercenary army.  So upon his return in 399, Xenophon set out once again, joining the Spartan campaigns against the Persians in Asia Minor. In the course of these campaigns, Xenophon became an intimate friend of the (Eurypontid) Spartan king Agesilaus II.  In 394, Xenophon returned to Greece and fought alongside the Spartans during the Corinthian War against his Athenian homeland. Exiled from Athens, Xenophon lived in Sparta for many years.  Xenophon's extensive familiarity of Sparta is captured in his reflections on the Spartan king Agesilaus, and his Polity, discussing the laws, institutions and education of Spartan citizens.  In 386, Xenophon moved to the Spartan town of Scillus (near Ellis, western Peloponnesus).  He was expelled from Scillus by the Eleans in 371, and took up residence in Corinth. Around 369, Athens repealed his exile, but Xenophon elected to remain in Corinth until his death.  Xenophon's Economics is essentially a manual of household management, presented as a Socratic dialogue.  The principles are articulated by Socrates as what he heard from a landlord-farmer named Ischomachus.  Xenophon's Revenues is not a dialogue, but a tract proposing some solutions to the problem of poverty in Athens without imposing too harshly on its tributary allies . Xenophon authored a couple of other practical instruction manuals, including On Horsemanship (on raising horses) and Cynegeticus (on hunting). The Memorabilia is frequently cited as his best work (it includes a rare sketch of Aristippus). More reflections on politics can be found in Hiero (a dialogue on tyranny), Cyropaedia (a fictional account of the optimal education of a ideal ruler) and the Cavalry General (on the Athenian hipparch).  Xenophon also wrote the Hellenica, a narrative history of Greece from the point that Thucydides had left off (411) to the battle of Mantinea (362), where Xenophon's son, Gryllus, was slain.  Xenophon died around 355/54 in Corinth.      Major Works of Xenophon     Resources on Xenophon   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca"

Allyn A. Young, 1876-1929.,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/young.htm,"American economist. Born in Kenton, Ohio, the son of schoolteachers, and raised on the South Dakota frontier. Allyn Abbot Young was educated at Hiram College in Ohio, earning his BA in 1894.  After a few years working as a printer, Young enrolled at the University of Wisconsin to study under Richard T. Ely, obtaining his Ph.D at  in 1902 . Young subsequently took a string of posts, starting with the US Census Bureau in 1900, then Case Western Reserve in 1902.  He moved on to Dartmouth in 1904 and then Stanford, where was head of the economics department from 1906.  In 1911, Young became professor of economics at Washington University (St. Louis) before moving, in 1913, to Cornell, then a bastion of Neoclassicism (Frank Knight was among his students there).  War-related activities kept him Washington and New York in 1917-18.   In 1920, Young joined the faculty at Harvard University and quickly became the shining star of the department. Edward H. Chamberlin was among his students.  A popular lecturer, Young had heavy teaching and supervisory burdens and thus his research suffered accordingly.   Nonetheless, much of Young's ideas are hidden in other forms, notably in several textbooks (Young revised later editions of  Ely's famous Outlines).  Young also produced a massive stream of book reviews for the AER and other American journals, some of which became quite seminal  (e.g. his reviews of Jevons, Wicksteed, etc).  In 1927, Young ""escaped"" to London and took up the reigns of the economics department at the London School of Economics from Edwin Cannan.    Young's best-known contribution to economics is his 1928 essay on increasing returns and growth, resurrecting Adam Smith's pet theory. Although ignored in his day, it was heavily influential on Young's student at the LSE, Nicholas Kaldor.  It is often regarded as one of the precursor to endogenous growth theory.   After his untimely death from influenza in 1929, Young's shoes at the LSE were filled by his successor, Lionel Robbins.      Major works of Allyn A.

Arthur Young, 1741-1820,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/arthuryoung.htm," English farmer, journalist and agricultural economist.  Arthur Young was born the son of a clergyman, the rector of Bradfield, near Bury St. Edmunds in rural Suffolk, to a well-connected political family.  After a period of schooling in Lavenham, young Arthur was apprenticed to a wine merchant in Lynn and groomed for a career in commerce. He showed an early aptitude for literary career, publishing a couple of political tracts on the Seven Years' War and novels while still in his teens. After his father's death and at his mother's urging, Arthur Young, moved back to his family estates at Bradfield, near Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk, and tried his hand at farming.  In 1767, Young moved on to Hertfordshire to set up his own farm.   It was around this time that Young got interested in the new methods of farming to increase yields.  As one of his biographers quips, Young's writings ""produced more private losses and more public benefit than those of any other author"" (p.190) Starting in late 1764, Arthur Young began publishing articles on farming in the Museum Rusticum et Commerciale, a short-lived journal of the time.  These were republished and expanded in his Farmer's Letters (1767).  Young became a proponent of the ""scientific"" agriculture, advertising new methods such as crop rotation, nitrogen-fixing, new implements, selective breeding, etc. He gathered much of what he learnt from his travels around England (his observations were duly reported in his 1768-1771 publications).  He combined his enthusiasm for these novel techniques with more general observations about farm management, urging the landed gentry of England to become more ""commerce-minded"" about their estates.  His 1774 Political Arithmetic was an attempt at a more general economic treatise.  Paradoxically, Young was himself never quite a success at farming and so, to supplement his income, he became a journalist for the Morning Post in 1773, reporting on Parliamentary debates.  Yet that did not stop his promotion of agrarian innovation. His works were widely translated and his fame such that he was dispensing farming advice to such figures as the American president George Washington and the British King George III.   In 1780, Young published his Tour of Ireland, similar to his earlier English tours, but, this time, also an indictment of government policy.  He denounced the Catholic penal laws and British commercial restrictions that kept Irish agriculture in a penurious state.  In 1784, Young founded the Annals of Agriculture, a journal for like-minded agricultural reformers like himself (and others besides -- Jeremy Bentham published many of his papers here; so did ""farmer"" George III).  In 1788-1790, Young happened to be traveling through France and observed the French Revolution first-hand.  In his 1792 travelogue, Young identified how the dismal condition of French agriculture had made the Ancien regime unsustainable.  His work speaks ominously of rural violence brought about by unemployment,  absenteeism, and the concentration of property-ownership -- lessons, he thought, Britain ought to heed.  In 1793, Young was appointed secretary to the British Board of Agriculture under Sir John Sinclair, a new government institution designed to promote ""scientific agriculture"".  Under Sinclair and Young, the Board conducted a series of extensive surveys of English counties.. Arthur Young's legacy is mixed.  Certainly, his extensive travelogues and surveys have left economic historians with a lot of invaluable data.  But the extent to which he was actually responsible (or involved) in the ""Agricultural Revolution"" in England is a bit more debatable.  Many of the recommendations he made were suspect or outright folly.  For all his careful county-by-county accounts, Young was apt to be so enthralled by any new method or institution to recommend its application across Britain, often with little regard for local differences in soil, climate and economy.  Indeed, some have claimed that the agricultural revolution happened in spite of, rather than because of, Arthur Young.  Young was first and foremost a journalist, not a farmer-scientist of the caliber of James Anderson. But it is precisely as a chronicler of the Agricultural Revolution that Young is most valuable.

Ernest Zermelo, 1871-1953,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/schools/game.htm#zermelo," Game Theory has emerged recently as a powerful challenger to the conventional method of examining economics. Although many illustrious predecessors worked on problems in what can be called ""game theory"", the fundamental, formal conception of game theory as part and parcel of economic theory were first organized in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's 1944 classic, Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944).  The main purpose of game theory is to consider situations where instead of agents making decisions as reactions to exogenous prices (""dead variables""), their decisions are strategic reactions to other agents actions (""live variables""). An agent is faced with a set of moves he can play and will form a strategy, a best response to his environment, which he will play by. Strategies can be either ""pure"" (i.e. play a particular move) or ""mixed"" (random play). A "" Nash Equilibrium"" will be reached when each agent's actions begets a reaction by all the other agents which, in turn, begets the same initial action. In other words, the best responses of all players are in accordance with each other. Game Theory can be roughly divided into two broad areas: non-cooperative (or strategic) games and co-operative (or coalitional) games. The meaning of these terms are self evident, although John Nash claimed that one should be able to reduce all co-operative games into some non-cooperative form. This position is what is known as the ""Nash Programme"". Within the non-cooperative literature, a distinction can also be made between ""normal"" form games (static) and ""extensive"" form games (dynamic). John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern (1944) introduced the strategic normal game, strategic extensive game, the concept of pure/mixed strategies, coalitional games as well as the axiomatization of expected utility theory, which was so useful for economics under uncertainty. They employed the ""maximin"" solution concept derived earlier by John von Neumann (1928) to solve simple strategic, zero-sum normal games.  In 1950, John Nash introduced the concept of a ""Nash Equilibrium"" (NE), which became the organizing concept under Game Theory -- even though the concept actually stretched as far back as Cournot (1838). Nash followed this up in 1951 with the concept of a ""Nash Bargaining Solution"" (NBS) for coalitional games. Then the floodgates opened for the refinement of Nash Equilibrium. In the field of non-cooperative games, R. Duncan Luce and Howard Raiffa (1957) provided the first popular textbook on game theory and, in it, they formalized the idea of the Iterated Elimination of Dominated Strategies (IEDS) method for Strategic Normal Games and introduced the concept of ""Repeated Game"" (static games which are played several times over). H.W. Kuhn (1953) introduced extensive games with ""imperfect information"" (i.e. where one does not know what moves have already been played by other players). William Vickrey (1961) provided the first formalization of ""auctions"". Reinhard Selten (1965) developed the concept of a ""Subgame Perfect Equilibrium"" (SPE) (i.e. elimination by backward induction) as a refined solution for extensive form games. John C. Harsanyi (1967-8) developed the concept of a ""Bayesian Nash Equilibrium"" (BNE) for Bayesian games (i.e. games with incomplete information - where there is some uncertainty surrounding moves, or where ""nature"" plays as well.) In coalitional (co-operative) games further refinements also occurred. Lloyd Shapley (1953) introduced the concept of the ""Shapley Value"" and the ""Core"" (which had been originally conceived by F.Y. Edgeworth (1881)) as solutions to Coalitional Games. Throughout the early 1960s, Robert J. Aumann and Martin Shubik began to apply cooperative game theory extensively throughout economics (e.g. industrial organization, general equilibrium, monetary theory, etc.), and, in the process, went on to invent several solution concepts for coalitional games (e.g. Bargaining Set, Strong Equilibrium), ""large games"" with infinite players and early statements of the ""Folk Theorems"" (solution concepts for Repeated Games). David Schmeidler (1969) developed the ""Nucleolus"" solution for coalitional games. Further developments emerged in the 1970s. John C. Harsanyi (1973) provided a remarkably insightful new interpretation of the concept of a ""mixed strategy"". Robert J. Aumann (1974) defined ""Correlated Equilibrium"" for Bayesian Games while Reinhard Selten (1975) introduced ""Trembling Hand Equilibrium"" for Bayesian Games. Further definitions came: Robert J. Aumann (1976) formally defined the concept of ""Common Knowledge"", opening a floodgate of literature, while B.D. Bernheim and D.G. Pearce (1984) formalized the concept of ""rationalizability"". Advancements continued apace: David M. Kreps and Robert Wilson (1982) introduced the concept of ""Sequential Equilibrium"" (SEQE) for extensive games with imperfect information.   Ariel Rubinstein (1982), following an early insight by Frederik Zeuthen (1930), transformed the co-operative Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) into a non-cooperative strategic extensive game of sequential bargaining. Elon Kohlberg and Jean-François Mertens (1986) developed the concept of ""Forward Induction"" for extensive games. Drew Fudenberg and E.S. Maskin (1986) developed one of the more famous ""Perfect Folk Theorems"" for infinitely repeated games. Finally, J.C. Harsanyi and R.Selten (1988) developed the idea of ""equilibrium selection"" for any type of game while D. Fudenberg and Jean Tirole (1991) developed the ""Bayesian Perfect Equilibrium"" (BPE) for Extensive Bayesian Games . Evolutionary game theory started its development slightly later.  Its objective is to apply the concepts of non-cooperative game theory to explain such phenomena which are often thought to be the result of cooperation or human design - i.e. ""institutions"" and ""conventions"" such as market formation, price mechanisms, social rules of conduct, money and credit, etc. One of the earliest exponents of the theory of evolutionary games was Thomas C. Schelling (1960, 1981) who argued that apparently ""cooperative"" social institutions (in this case, settlements to conflicts) are maintained by essentially by ""threats"" of punishment and retaliation  This has been followed up particularly in the 1990s.. Several Nobel Prizes have been awarded to some of major figures of Game Theory: the Nobel was shared by John Nash, J.C. Harsanyi and R. Selten in 1994 and William Vickrey and James Mirrlees in 1996. Herbert Simon won the Nobel in 1979 for concepts (e.g. bounded rationality) which have since been incorporated into the corpus of (Evolutionary) Game Theory.

Georg Heinrich Zincke, 1692-1768,https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/zincke.htm," German Neo-Cameralist. A German preacher's son, Georg Heinrich Zincke left school at any early age to join the army.  He fought in the War of Spanish Succession, was captured in 1709 and taken as a prisoner to France.  After escaping from a P.O.W. camp,  Zincke made his way to Jena  to pursue a course of studies in theology and law, obtaining a master's degree in 1713.  After a brief employment with a noble family, he proceeded to Erfurt, where he set himself up as a teacher and preacher.  He also lectured and took courses at the University of Halle.   G.H. Zincke obtained his Dr. Juris. at Erfurt in 1720 and became a lawyer and government official in Halle.  In 1731, he proceeded to take up a position as Hofrath with the Duke of Saxe-Weimar.  But Zincke's administrative improprieties resulted in his arrest and imprisonment for three years.   After his release, the wretched Zincke was taken up by Duke Christian in Saalfeld.  In 1740, his health restored,  Zincke declined a position in St. Petersburg to become a lecturer at the University of Leipzig on law and Cameralistics.   He published several outlines of courses of lectures (1742).  Zincke also founded and edited a cameralistics journal (Leipziger Sammlungen), which ran from 1744 until 1767. In 1745, Zincke left his academic perch in Leipzig to take up a position as professor and curator of the new Collegium Carolinum in Brunswick.  Although with grand title and position there, Zincke did not have as much administrative control over the institution as he had hoped.  He continued lecturing at the school and a position in the service of Brunswick-Lüneburg.  During this period, G.H. Zincke produced his Cameralisten Bibliothek (1751), a  monumental bibliography of Cameralist works, and his introductory Anfangsgründe (1755)      Major Works of Georg Heinrich Zincke     Resources on  G.H.

Colbertisme was born out of the peculiar political and fiscal situation of France.  Unlike England, which had achieved a internal political and economic unity and centralization quite early on, France had spent much of its existence broken up into pieces.  Although the largest and richest of European nations, the French state had been congenitally incapable of mobilizing those resources to its ends.  As a result, French monarchs were routinely bullied by their vassals and preyed upon by nimbler neighbors.  France stumbled into the 17th Century, devastated by a brutal religious civil war (1560-1598), but at least politically united under the new Bourbon king Henry IV.  The first matter of business taken up by the Maximilien de Béthune (Duke of Sully), Henry IV's finance minister from 1598, was the reorganization of monarchical finances which were, at the time, in a mess.   The Duke of Sully inaugurated his term by engineering the second French State bankruptcy in 1599, repudiating large chunks of the public debt, replacing them with new annuities in return for further loans. He instituted new taxes on office-holders (the paulette), lowered the official interest rate, improved tax-collection and reigned in court expenditures, gradually bringing the French crown back into solvency. Sully's most famous innovation was the finalization of the Cinq Grosses Fermes, grouping five major tariffs. .He also begins the build-up of a new network of roads and canals to improve transportation and the channeling of funds to improve agriculture. He also lifts restrictions on the circulation of grain and wine (1601).  Sully also encouraged the formation of the first French East Indies companies to compete for spice trade in Asia with the newly-formed Dutch and English companies.  However, it was not a success.  The French merchant communities (mostly concentrated in the Atlantic ports of Brittany and Normandy) had tremendous problems drumming up the capital.  The first company - sometimes known as the ""Saint-Malo company"" - manage to cobble a little fleet in 1601 under the Sieur de la Bardeliere, but it was a failure.  Although the French East Indies charter would be passed around for the years, through various companies and incarnations, the next expedition was only sent out in 1617.  Sully was more apprehensive about the Canada and personally objected to the fur-trade monopoly granted to DuGua du Mons (who went to establish the colony of French Acadia in Canada in 1604).  Sully resigned in 1611, a year after Henry IV's assassination, unable to work with the new regent queen Marie de' Medici. French economic policy nonetheless remained in the hands of Henry IV's old advisors for a while, and continued to follow the example of Sully. The rise of the Armand de Plessis (Cardinal Richelieu) in the 1620s opened a more energetic phase of French history.   Richelieu's active foreign policy and wars were costly, but Richelieu paid for them with increasing centralization, including the introduction of intendants (royal tax inspectors) in the provinces, granting them (in 1629) the authority to bypass local authorities and report directly to the crown, to ensure that taxes were delivered.  Richelieu also took an active interest in overseas commerce. In 1626, Richelieu granted charters to three new French companies: the first French West Indies company (Compagnie de Saint-Christophe) to establish sugar colonies in the Caribbean, the first African trading company (Compagnie de Dieppe and Rouen) to open the slave trade in West Africa, and a new Canadian fur-trading company (Compagnie de Morbihan).  After the ""Day of the Dupes"" in 1630, control of finances was passed firmly into the hands of Richelieu. Needing the political loyalty of the provincial estates, Richelieu scrapped plans to convert the Pays d'etat provinces into Pays d'elections.  He made up for fiscal shortfalls with the sale of new offices and heavily increasing taxes - the taille (property tax) and gabelle (salt tax) would be doubled in a few short years. But the French entry into the Thirty Years War in 1634 blew up the budget.  Richelieu increased taxes even more and made intendants (hitherto temporary) into permanent positions.  In 1636, Hapsburg armies invaded France, expected to exploit a tax revolt, but it failed to materialize. Richelieu also saw some significant monetary reforms, notably the introduction of the gold Louis d'or in 1640 and a new silver ecu in 1642. Richelieu death in 1642 was followed a few month later by the death of his master Louis XIII.  The French state fell into the hands of Richelieu's successor as new chief minister, Cardinal Jules Mazarin, who, together with the queen-mother Anne of Austria, headed the regency council for the toddler king Louis XIV.  Jean-Baptiste Colbert emerged from the shadows as an assistant to Mazarin.  After the death of Mazarin in 1661, Louis XIV appointed himself his own prime minister, and Colbert transferred to the king's service.  Colbert helped Louis XIV topple Nicolas Foquet, the powerful superintendant of finances, and, in 1663, Colbert was given the position of Comptroller-General of Finances (Contrôleur général des finances), the supreme head of the French state finances, and began setting France on a ""Mercantilist"" tack - transforming the vast agricultural country of France into a commercial and industrial power to rival Holland and England.  While external barriers went up, internal barriers were brought down to facilitate the growth of vital industries. e.g. 1664, Colbert turned the Cinq Grosses Fermes into a single internal customs union on north and western France, abolishing customs duties within them. The corvee was revived for road-building, connecting ports to internal industries.. Charter companies were revived and manufacturing luxury works were coddled with State assistance. Caribbean and African colonies were acquired.  The nautical and manufacturing industries of the Atlantic ports took off. But for all of Colbert's efforts, Louis XIV's insistence on wars in Europe - and there were many wars - and the erection of a grand palace and maintenance of a court at Versailles stretched the sinews of the French state treasury.  Colbert miraculously managed to maintain some control and keeping it from busting the crown's finances.  But when Colbert died in 1683, the restraining hand was gone.  Louis XIV pursued ever more wars and ever greater extravagances.  At his death in 1715, the French crown was bankrupt.  Many of the state officials called for a return to the ""Colbertisme"" as a way out of the subsequent fiscal mess.

First Economists (Humanists, etc. ),https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/schools/first.htm," The 16th Century was a century of transition in Europe.  Although common to summarize it as a ""Renaissance"", that is perhaps too rosy a monicker, given the travails it went through.   It is more apt to describe it as the passageway between the Medieval and the Modern age, and belonging strictly to neither.   Humanism and Reformation For Europe, the 16th Century began audaciously.  The short decade of the 1490s was a bewildering one.  The discovery of America by Christopher Columbus in 1492 and the opening of the sea route to India by Vasco da Gama in 1498 suddenly enlarged the physical boundaries of the Europe -- and, with it, the political, mental and spiritual boundaries of Europeans themselves.   The Age of Discovery undermined the hitherto authoritative world views of the Ancient Greeks and Medieval Schoolmen.  Any child who had witnessed the marvels of America and Asia being unloaded on to the docks of Lisbon and Cadiz would find the classical pronouncements on geography, zoology, botany, etc. laughable.  And so the scholars wondered: if the Ancients and the Scholastics had been so completely wrong about the physical universe, what else might they have been wrong about?  And so, in the early 1500s, a spirit of intellectual liberty and iconoclasm swept through the schools of Europe.  It was initially driven by Humanist scholars.  The Humanists had emerged in late 15th C. Italy, and soon spread to northern Europe, notably the Low Countries.  The original impetus was the rediscovery of a new wave of lost works from classical antiquity that flooded the west after the fall of Constantinople in 1453.  This broke the Medieval dependence on Aristotle, allowing them to embrace a wider variety of sources of classical knowledge.  No longer bound to narrow Scholastic pedantry and dogmatic ""certainties"", the Humanists began to appeal to a merger of reason and religious morality, rather than depend on authority and tradition, as the guide to doctrine. With their exquisite Latin and sharp satire, they reduced old icons and doctrines into objects of derision.  The emergence of the printing press in southern Germany, which was set up in every major European city by the end of the 15th C., allowed them to communicate quickly and efficiently, and helped forge a pan-European intellectual elite.  The Humanists promoted classical education, particularly in philosophy, literature and history,  particularly among ruling elite, believing it would lead to a revival of public virtue and social harmony.   The early Humanists dreamt boldly and optimistically of a new European order for the new century. They naively believed that once the blinders of stifling dogma were lifted and reason allowed full reign, wars and strife would also come to an end.  The ascension of the young Hapsburg Emperor Charles V in 1519 seemed to offer a practical opportunity to their flights of fancy. The diligent work of his grandfathers had paid off handsomely and Charles V inherited an empire which included much of Europe - Spain, the Low Countries,  Italy, Germany as well as the known Americas. Many Humanists saw in Charles V the best chance yet for the political unification of Europe, the benign ""universal monarchy"" which would end war and disorderly strife and facilitate Europe's transition into a rational, virtuous utopia.   But already in the 1520s, the Humanist dream began to unravel before political realities.  France had only just escaped extinction and dismemberment in the ferocious feudal chaos of the previous century and was emerging as a new unified power.  The ambitious Valois monarch was not about to succumb quietly to the universalist aspirations of a bright-eyed Hapsburg teenager.  In 1521, war broke out between France and the Hapsburg Empire which would rage, on and off, for much of the remainder of the century. Just as political unity and peace was escaping from their grasp, hope for rational doctrinal reform was shocked by the arrival of the Reformation.  The Humanists' iconoclasm had paved the way for Martin Luther.  And while many Humanists were sympathetic to the 95 theses Luther nailed to the door at Wittenberg on that fateful day in 1517, Luther was not one of their own.   The Humanists aimed at doctrinal conciliation through reason, hoping for reform from above, by influencing the minds of the ruling classes and scholars of Europe in their witty, erudite Latin.  But the fiery Luther spoke of confrontation and certainty in his blunt, peasant German.  Luther's  stubborn stance -- ""Here I stand; I can do no other"" -- despaired the Humanists.  As the schism in western Christendom took shape,  the Humanist dream of a rational, universal church was turned to ashes by the torches of intolerance, sectarianism and dogmatic strife. By 1555, the Emperor was exhausted and Germany was divided and delivered to its princes.  The Valois-Hapsburg hostilities were suspended by Cateau-Cambresis (1559).  But now it was France's turn to be enveloped in religious chaos. Calvinism, a more radical form of Reformed Christianity, centered at Geneva since the 1540s, had been spreading deeply throughout France.  In the 1560s, a tripartite civil war ripped France apart - the Calvinist Huguenots demanded religious tolerance, the ultras of the Catholic League demanded nothing short of an inquisition while a middle faction of politiques attempted to navigate between them and desperately keep France stitched together.  As the religious militias took to each other's throats, the crown of France tumbled nearly into irrelevance. The resolution - the Edict of Nantes in 1598 - bought an uneasy peace.  The French crown was delivered to the House of Bourbon,  and the great citadels of the west and south of France were left in the hands of the Huguenots, a precarious state-within-a-state.  Now France too was divided. The Reformation had a substantial impact on European attitudes.    However, the two main protagonists of the Reformation, Luther and Calvin, had different ideas on economic matters.  Martin Luther, on the advice of the logician Philipp Melancthon, did not depart much from the old Scholastic positions.  For instance Luther agreed to the ban on usury and condemned monopolistic practices, financial speculation, importation of luxury goods, etc. with even more verve than the Scholastics had done.  Given the end of Ecclesiastical authorities, Luther insisted that secular authorities step in to enforce these rules, a call for intervention which was may have encouraged later Mercantilism.  His promotion of ""political communities"" may further explain its nationalistic flavor. In contrast, John Calvin's impact was less associated with Mercantilism and more with the capitalist age which followed it.  Calvin's theology had no room for nationalism or the State, both of which were seen as subordinate to religious authority.  Unlike Luther, Calvin was willing to drop the Scholastic economic doctrines entirely.  He was a critic of the traditional ban on usury, arguing that as long as it was not excessive, it was entirely acceptable.   Several commentators (notably, Max Weber and R.H. Tawney) have given great relevance to relationship between capitalism and the ""Protestant ethic"".   Their claim, in effect, is that Calvinist dogma ""excused"" and even ""encouraged"" (directly or indirectly) private acquisitiveness and accumulation.  Of course, the mercantile-minded Renaissance princes, many of them Catholics, did not need to subscribe to the doctrines of Luther or Calvin, to justify themselves.  Their Machiavellian outlook and demeanors sufficed. Rise of Antwerp The 16th century claimed two other significant casualties - the great commercial empires of the Venetian Republic in the Mediterranean and the Hanseatic League in the North and Baltic Seas. There is little doubt that the 1400s had belonged to Venice.  In the course of that century, her ancient and deadly rival, Genoa, fell on hard times, while Venice had gone from strength to strength.  Through the markets of Alexandria, Venice had exclusive access to African gold and Asian spices. While the rest of Europe was suffering a precious metal drought and debasing their currencies in a hurry, Venice alone could maintain the purity of her gold ducat.  Venice used these riches to go adventuring in Italy, nabbing great chunks of the Italian mainland, whether through hired mercenary armies, or as foreclosures on her loans.  But Venice's fortunes changed quickly by the turn of the century.  In 1498, the Portuguese captain Vasco da Gama swung around the Cape of Good Hope, opening up an alternative direct sea route to India.  In a few short years,  the Portuguese quickly seized control of the Indian Ocean lanes and severed Venice's old routes to Asian trade.  As if this was not enough, the Genoese came roaring back into the picture, placing their financing, trade networks  and expertise at Portugal's disposal.  The Genoese helped set up Antwerp as a keystone of a new, rival commercial complex.  Portuguese spice ships returning from Asia would forward their cargo to Antwerp, to be sold throughout northern Europe.  Silver from the new mines of Tyrol and Bohemia, in Venice's backyard, so necessary for the Asian spice trade, were redirected by Augsburg and Nuremberg merchants by river routes up to Antwerp, where it would be loaded onto Portuguese ships heading back to Asia.  In the opposite direction, African gold, carried by the Portuguese from the Akan goldfields of west Africa, poured into Antwerp in exchange for the German silver.    Just as the Venetian were attempting to come to grips with the new competition, they felt the weight of two military onslaughts. From the east, the rising Ottoman Turks, who had conquered Constantinople back in 1453, learned to sail and took to the sea.  Before the end of the century, the Ottomans had destroyed the Venetian navy and begun nabbing Venice's overseas possessions in the east Mediterranean.  This culminated in the Ottoman conquest of Mameluke Egypt and its all-important commercial port of Alexandria in 1516.  From the west, the crowned heads of Europe finally got their act together and began to fight back back against Venice's pretensions.  In the League of Cambrai, nearly all the major European powers combined to launch a joint offensive on the Most Serene Republic, seeking to dispossess the hated hyperpower of her mainland possessions.   Miraculously, Venice divided her enemies and survived another day. But she was never to be as powerful again. The new Portuguese-Genoese-Augsburg commercial complex, centered at Antwerp, dominated European commerce for much of the 16th century. But precious metal was a strain. The gold the Portuguese brought in from West Africa was never enough, and the Augsburg silver, however great, soon began running out.  To liberate precious metal for the Asian trade and finance the endless Hapsburg-Valois wars,  Italian and German merchants pioneered the use of correspondence trade and bills of exchange. By the mid-1550s, much of inter-European commerce was conducted by paper.  Parallel to this, the Hanseatic League, which had once enjoyed as dominant a monopoly in the north as Venice had had in the south, suffered a similar ignominious fate in the course of the 16th C.   The new Antwerp network side-stepped the old Hanseatic channels, and fostered the rise of non-Hanseatic merchants and fleets in the Low Countries.  The Hansa faced not only new competition, but a more technically advanced one as well.  The Hansa's old cogs were not as profitably designed as the new Dutch ships; unable to strike into open ocean, they missed out on the great Atlantic cod-fishing bonanza and overseas trade.  The Hansa were also slow to pick up on the credit  revolution pioneered on the continent.  As the Hansa struggled to compete, they were delivered a series of terrific political blows - their positions in the Baltics were upturned by an expansionary Muscovy,  the always-troublesome king of Denmark had grown more assertive,  and the monarchs of England, finding new sources of finance closer to home, began stripping the Hanseatic merchants of their privileges and, by 1597, had expelled them from England altogether. The age of Antwerp set in motion the transition of European commercial life from the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, and eventually from southern Europe to northern Europe, that would accelerate in the 17th Century The Golden Age of Spain The Hapsburg empire was divided in 1555 into Spanish and Austrian branches.  The Spanish branch got the lion's share, including the all-important Low Countries and wealthy Antwerp.  In 1580, the Spanish monarch stumbled on another piece of luck when the Portuguese dynasty expired and her Asian commercial empire fell into his lap.  With France crippled by civil war, the Spanish monarch Philip II, could concentrate on internal matters, hammering the once-disparate domains into a centrally-administered kingdom, and presiding over an age of Spanish imperial supremacy. For his centralizing efforts, Philip II of Spain relied on a growing state bureaucracy, the Holy Inquisition and a standing army in Flanders, three greatly expensive state institutions that, at any other time, would have been fiscally impossible to maintain.  The Spanish monarch needed gold, vast sums of it, to maintain them all.   The conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires in the 1520s and 1530s had given the Hapsburgs two great injections from the accumulated gold stocks of the American empires, topped off with a little gold panning in the West Indies, but that was all quickly spent.  The trickling from the Portuguese sources in west Africa were welcome, but insufficient for the needs of the Spanish crown. The real jackpot was the massive silver strikes in Zacatecas (Mexico) and above all, Potosi (Bolivia) in the mid-century.  Spanish treasure fleets were soon carrying mind-boggling volumes of silver into the ports of Cadiz and Seville.   The trick was now to turn that silver into the service of a state and army that insisted on being paid on gold.  The Augsburg bankers, the traditional financiers of the Hapsburgs, had been hobbled by the first Spanish state default of 1557.  But the Genoese had risen to replace them.  They erected an intricate money market network centered on three vertices - Antwerp, Besançon (later Piacenza) and Medina del Campo.  There, they pioneered the development of asientos, Spanish state bonds, to be purchased by gold and redeemed in silver.  Silver shipments, touching Cadiz, would make their way to Genoa, where they were swapped for gold in the Italian markets, the silver shipped right back out to Asia, the gold carried overland along the ""Spanish Road"" to Antwerp. Once spent on Spanish garrisons in Flanders, the gold went back into circulation, so Genoese agents set about recovering it, deploying bills of exchange to clear any imbalance of payments and retain as much gold as possible within Hapsburg crown lands.   The Genoese-managed terpsichory kept Spanish state finances humming and enabled it to enjoy its ascendancy.  For their services, the Genoese financiers charged huge middlemen slices and exorbitant interest on bridging loans that pricked at the sensitivities of the Spanish Cortes.  It was this parliament that forced the Spanish crown into its second great default in 1575, in an effort to write out the Genoese.  But they soon learned their lesson - with Genoese financing suspended, the Spanish Army of Flanders went unpaid, and in 1576, went on a rampage, destroying nearly a third of the great city of Antwerp.  The sack of Antwerp drove people, merchants and business away from that great commercial city, north to the hitherto sleepy port of Amsterdam, opening a new chapter in the commercial and economic history of Europe. The Revolt of the Netherlands The centralizing tendencies of the Catholic monarchs of Spain put them at odds with local authorities.  So, it should be no surprise to find, already by the 1560s, the princes and statholders of the Low Countries trying to push back and reclaim their prerogatives. Mistakes were made, the argument soured, and soon the quarrel between the Spanish monarch and his renegade vassals in the Low Countries careened into all-out open revolt.   In 1579, led by Holland, seventeen provinces of the Calvinist-heavy north seceded from the Spanish-controlled and Catholic-heavy south and declared independence, forming the United Provinces of the Netherlands, a new country who's dizzying ascendancy and fortunes over the next century would be the envy of Europe. Queen Elizabeth of England's surreptitious support of the Dutch rebels brought the island-kingdom into conflict with the Spanish hyperpower.  In 1588, she narrowly escaped grievous punishment when the Great Spanish Armada met with disaster off the coast.  The individual heroics of England's fledgling pirate-captains, like Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh, zipping defiantly in-and-out of  her Atlantic ports and overseas colonies, mocked the might of the Spain.  Although little more than an irritation to Spain, the overseas adventures of English captains were more significant in changing English mentality. Traditionally, English policy had been focused on her lost dominions in continental France and her commerce had been abdicated into the hands of Italian and Hanseatic merchants.  Now England began entertaining the idea of looking westwards, and maybe going overseas herself.   Her adventurers had build her up a navy from scratch, her merchants had grown more confident. The Great Inflation Beyond the superstructure, there were two great underlying economic changes in western Europe: a population boom and the great inflation.  Since the Great Plague of the 1350s, the population of European countries had remained relatively flat - certainly in the countryside.  But this now began to change, and population growth began to pick up in the early 16th C. and would continue into the early decades of the next.   With greater population, came greater demand - for goods and land.  So it is unsurprising that, starting around the 1510s, the prices of commodities, notably consumer essentials like grain, also began a century-long secular rise.  Given that the flat or declining prices of the previous centuries, this is commonly called the ""price revolution"" or ""great inflation"" of the 16th C.  Parallel to this entered a new kind of farmer.  Wealthy urban merchants and manufacturers invested their accumulated  fortunes in land, hoping to capitalize on rising food prices and rents (and acquire the social status associated with landownership),   This  was particularly accentuated in northern Europe, where the Protestant Reformation brought a a lot of church-owned lands into the hands of the princes, who promptly sold them to the highest bidder to finance their wars.   But unlike the old gentry, with their paternalist noblesse oblige towards the peasantry, the nouveau riche brought their urban profit-seeking ethos along with them, treating their farms as just another business, ""factories of corn and beef"".  Ancient, tradition-bound rural relations between landlord and tenant, already strained by land scarcity, were upset as they were confronted with landlords prepared to enclose land and evict tenants to make way for sheep and other more profitable ventures.   As capitalist agriculture began to take root, small tenants were turned into wage laborers, adding to a labor supply already expanding with population growth, and kept wages flat despite rising prices.  Although poverty always existed,  the numbers and desperation of the poor increased greatly in scale in the 16th C.  Accentuating the problem, social institutions, like the rural commons and monasteries, which had long served as a safety net for the very poor, were beginning to disappear or had disappeared altogether, leaving many little option but to migrate, roaming the roads, looking desperately for work, begging as they went.  For many contemporaries, all this seemed to have appeared out of nowhere.   While the effects were visible --  the rising prices, the mass surge of beggars, etc., -- the causes were unknown.  Some dusted off old tried-and-true explanations that had occasionally served in the past,  but the sustained nature of  the new economic distress defied them.  And policy was nearly as lost - no matter how often they were whipped, the beggars simply did not disappear.    What we have called the ""first economists"" are the disparate collection of commentators of the 16th Century, who attempted to grapple with the new economic order, and come up with new explanations.  Most had little by way of guidance.  Unlike the Scholastics they were not bound by past writings or authority, but looked to facts as they could see them, and best explanations their wit could reckon. The first economists wracked their brains to discover its cause of the Great Inflation and how to bring it under control.    ""Commonwealth"" writers like John Hales, saw it in the new agrarian order.  Many blamed merchants who were ""deliberately"" withholding goods from the market (which many were, but usually after the inflation set in, in anticipation of higher future prices).  Others blamed foreign commerce, arguing that the export of commodities had created scarcities at home.  Others, observing rising land rents and interest rates, blamed capitalist landlords and unscrupulous bankers. Some looked to the monetary side of things.  The Sieur de Malestroict, for instance, suggested that if coins have less pure precious metal in them, their ""intrinsic value"" will decline relative to the prices of other goods. Hence, the recent inflation could be at least partly blamed on the debasement policies of European monarchs.  Where no debasement had occurred, then the falling precious metal content of coins must surely be due to a rise in illegal forgery and ""coin-clipping"" (the cutting off of the rough edges of minted coins).  Accordingly, the penalties meted out to anybody caught (or suspected) of these monetary crimes were among the most draconian on the books. However, from the 1550s onwards, a new idea began to take hold that it was not so much the intrinsic value of coins that had declined, but rather that the sheer quantity of coins had increased relative to the total supply of goods. This ""Quantity Theory of Money"" was first articulated by Nicholas Copernicus in 1526, but it only gained wider acceptance in the latter half of the century.  The Salamanca scholars such as Navarrus, the French jurist Jean Bodin and the Florentine banker Davanzati, were among the more ardent exponents of the Quantity Theory. For the Quantity Theorists, a rising supply of coins, regardless of the precise way by which it was increased, was the one cause behind all inflation.  They agreed that debasements and coin-clipping may cause inflation, not because they decrease the ""intrinsic value"" of coins, but rather because they cause more coins to be minted from a given stock of metal.  The Quantity Theorists, particularly Bodin, were keen to associate the surge in inflation in the 1550s and 1560s with the great flows of silver pouring into Spain from America after the discovery of the fabulous Potosí silver mines of Peru.  However, we should note that the Great Inflation was already in place long before any large-scale mining began. For the ever-watchful Catholic church, inflation posed a second difficulty.  By reducing the value of debt, lenders were thereby forced to charge high levels of interest to compensate for the loss.  Although it seemed just that lenders should recover at least what they lent, it was still usury.  The debate over justum pretium (""just price"") was resurrected in Ecclesiastical ranks in an effort to clarify the appropriate commercial practice. The Spanish School of Salamanca led the way in the revision, arguing that the ""just price"" is exactly what the market decides it is and usury is no great sin. The 16th Century was a century of transition in Europe.  Although common to summarize it as a ""Renaissance"", that is perhaps too rosy a monicker, given the travails it went through.   It is more apt to describe it as the passageway between the Medieval and the Modern age, and belonging strictly to neither. It was a century that began with high hopes of universal peace, harmony, rationality and prosperity and ended with more war, more division, more intolerance and greater mass poverty than it began.  The modern world had indeed begun.  And so had economics.
