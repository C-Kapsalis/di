Cantillon's System,"Cantillon's System ________________________________________________________ ""The Essai is far more than a mere essay or even collection of disconnected essays like those of Hume. It is a systematic and connected treatise, going over in a concise manner nearly the whole field of economics, with the exception of taxation.. It is thus more than any other book I know, the first treatise on economics...Cantillon's essay is, more emphatically than any other single work, ""the Cradle of Political Economy""."" (William Stanley Jevons, ""Cantillon and the Nationality of Political Economy"", 1881, Contemporary Review) ________________________________________________________ Back General equilibrium theory, indeed much of economics itself, owes its existence to an Irishman who lived obscurely in 18th Century France by the name of Richard Cantillon. In his remarkable Essai sur la Nature du Commerce en Generale (published only in 1755, but written c.1732-1734), Cantillon sets out, perhaps for the first time, the vision of an ""economy"" as a set of interacting markets connected by a price system with balanced circular flows of income between agents. Cantillon's setting was the first great breakthrough in economic theory - for it provided the fundamental structural idea behind the concept of an ""economy"" which was to possess all subsequent economics - Physiocratic, Classical and Neoclassical. We can set up a two-sector model of general equilibrium to illustrate the theory laid out in Cantillon's Essai. Let us have two factors (land and labor) and two goods (necessities and luxuries). Consequently there are four markets in operation and thus four prices to be discovered. To understand this, we need to step back a bit. Cantillon envisioned that we had two classes of people, landlords and laborers, the first owning land and consuming luxuries, the second owning labor and consuming necessities. As such, Cantillon foresaw there would be a ""circular flow of income and expenditure"" between landlords and laborers, the former contributing their land and receiving rents which they subsequently spent on luxuries, the latter contributing their labor and receiving wages and spending those on necessities. Cantillon's idea that ""flows of income"" were the proper subject of economic analysis was already a path-breaking insight, as it tore away from the Mercantilist obsession with the ""stock of wealth"". In Figure 1, we have an intuitive depiction of Cantillon's model. Income flows are represented by the solid arrows: thus income flows from the production of luxuries and necessities to the owners of land and labor. Expenditure flows are noted by the dashed arrows: landowners use their income to purchase luxuries; laborers use their income to purchase necessities. Finally, the total supply of land is assumed to be exogenous to the system, whereas the total supply of labor is endogenously determined by the amount of necessities. This is captured by the broken arrows connected to the total supply of land (T) and the total supply of labor (L).  Figure 1 - Cantillon's system Intuitively, it is easy to see that if flows of income, expenditure and labor supply are not ""balanced"" in some proper manner, then this whole economy could break down. For instance, if laborers do not receive enough wages to buy necessities, then they will starve and die, and thus goods which use labor as inputs are not produced, so that the landlords cannot buy their luxuries and they will also be deprived, etc. Whatever the form of breakdown, it is obvious that balance is hard to obtain. Yet, and this was the second crucial insight, Cantillon believed that such a balance was possible. In other words, he believed there is a way of obtaining a ""natural state"" or a balance of income-expenditure flows, that will not lead to a complete unravelling of the economy. The basic feature of this ""natural state"" is that both landlords and workers receive enough income to consume all necessities and luxuries produced (""market-clearing"") and that enough of these necessities are produced to sustain a desired labor supply level. Land, which Cantillon assumes is exogenously given, is the great constraining factor: it cannot be increased. Technology, or the proportion of labor and land used in the production of the goods, is also assumed to be given. Thus, the ""natural state"" is conditional on the amount of land available and the production technology. If the economic system is to achieve this natural state, Cantillon reasoned, there there must be some mechanism to maintain the balance of income flows. Thus, the third great insight of Cantillon was that ""natural prices"" were precisely that mechanism. We must note that these natural prices are not necessarily the actual market prices in existence at any point in time. There is a difference between the ""natural price"" of a good - or what Cantillon called its ""valeur intrisique"" (""intrinsic value"") - and its ""exchange value"" on the market at any point in time. As Cantillon writes: ""It often happens that many things which have actually this intrinsic value [natural price] are not sold in the market according to that value: that will depend on the humours and fancies of men and on their consumption...There is never a variation in intrinsic values, but the impossibility of proportioning the production of merchanise in a state to their consumption [i.e.""natural state""] causes a daily variation and a perpetual ebb and flow of market prices."" (R. Cantillon, 1755: Part I, Ch.10) Thus, ""natural prices"" are determined by the natural state, the balance of income-expenditure flows. In contrast, ""market prices"" are determined by what can be termed ""demand-and-supply"". Cantillon did not relate the two prices to each other very clearly: rather, as Schumpeter notes, Cantillon ""was led to treat market price as a separate phenomenon and to restrict the supply and demand explanation to it. Thus emerged the...formula: normal price is determined by cost, market price is determined by supply and demand. "" (Schumpeter, 1954: p.220). [As such, it is interesting to note, therefore, that not only was Cantillon the father of Classical theory, he was also, via his demand-and-supply, the father of Neoclassical theory - which is why Jevons (1881), went to such efforts to dig him out of obscurity. However, the path-breaking Cantillon was also the father of other things: via his emphasis on subjective ""fancy"" and his theory of entrepreneurship and uncertainty, he could be also said to be the father of Austrian economics and, via his explicit account of an endogenous flow-based quantity theory of money, he can also be said to be the father of modern monetary economics See F.A. Hayek (1936), J.J. Spengler (1954), G.L.S. Shackle (1982) and A. Murphy (1986) for retrospective accounts of Cantillon's manifold path-breaking contributions.] Let us proceed with a rather simple mathematical restatement of Cantillon's two-sector general equilibrium system (following Brems, 1986). Land (T) and labor (L) are both used to produce luxuries (XU) and necessities (XN). Nothing else is needed and the technology is a fixed proportions technology, so we can employ unit input coefficients, aTU, aTN, aLU and aLN where the coefficient aij represents the amount of input i needed to produce a single unit of output j, or aij = Fi/Xj where Fi is the factor i (in our case, either labor or land). Both labor and land are necessary to produce necessities and luxuries, so all these coefficients are positive. The amount of labor necessary to produce XN units of necessities is simply calculated as: LN = aLNXN Thus, if we are given the size of outputs, XN and XU, then by our fixed technology, following the same logic, we can figure out the other factor demands, LU, TN, TU using the other remaining technology coefficients in an analagous way, i.e. TN = aTNXN is the amount of land employed to produce XN necessities while LU = aLUXU and TU = aTUXU are, respectively, the land and labor required to produce XU units of luxuries. Thus, the total demand for land and labor is L = LN + LU and T = TN + TU. Cantillon proposed that total land, T, was ""given"". But total employment, L, he thought was variable and, indeed, endogenous to the system. He noted that labor was endogenous, that is, he thought that human reproduction was ""encouraged"" by the consumption of necessities. This peculiar notion is a perennial, if anachronistic, concept that pervades Classical economics. As Cantillon (1755: Pt. 1, Ch.15) argued, ""Men multiply like mice in a barn if they have unlimited means of subsistence,"" -- and went on to draw much amusing historical and anecdotal evidence for this. In sum, the amount of necessities produced, XN, will determine the total amount of labor in the economy, L. Let c be some fixed necessities-labor ratio, i.e. the amount of necessities needed to support a single laborer, c = XN/L. Thus the greater or smaller the number of necessities, then the greater or smaller the number of laborers. But what if not enough necessities are produced in the economy to sustain the given population? If there is an excess of laborers, these are, quite simply, starved off. If there is an insufficient, number of laborers, the large amount of necessities will ""encourage"" them to reproduce and increase. Labor supply, L, is thus endogenous to the system. Obviously, these labor supply effects probably take a few generations to work themselves out fully, thus it is clear that Cantillon is thinking in terms of a pretty long horizon of time. In this long-run, Cantillon is careful to note that there will naturally have to also be no profits. His time horizon is long enough that firms will be created and enter and exit production so as to wipe out any profit opportunities. Thus, the production processes, in the long-run, must break even: total revenues must be equal to total costs in each process. Total revenues are merely the price of the commodity multiplied by the amount produced, whereas total costs are the wages and rents paid to the labor and land employed in the production of the goods, or: pNXN = wLN + tTN pUXU = wLU + tTU where (pN, pL) are the prices of necessities and luxuries respectively while (w, t) are the wage and rent per unit of labor and land respectively. Now, if the system is to be balanced in the long run, then enough necessities much be produced to sustain the amount of labor desired. But if this is to be so, then the total wage bill over both industries (wL) must be sufficient to buy up all the necessities at the going prices (pNXN), i.e. wL = pNXN. If not, as Cantillon noted, population will change (for more or for less) and thus we will not have a long run balance. With this condition, we can easily note that plugging this in to our first revenue-cost equality, that: wL = wLN + tTN or as wL = w(LN+LU) by the definition of L, then wLU = tTN. But then plugging this into our second price-cost equality: pUXU = tTN + tTU so, obviously, we attain a second condition: pUXU = tT, by the definition of T. Thus, the rent bill received by landlords must exactly pay for the production of luxuries. These are the conditions for a long-run, sustainable economic system. The issue is now whether we can find a set of prices (w, t, pN, pU) which can maintain such a system. The solution is straightforward. Given the labor survivability condition, c = XN/L, and knowing that wL = pNXN, then obviously: w/pN = c the ""real wage"" is merely the cost of sustaining of a single laborer alive. What about rent? Well, let us divide our revenue-cost equalities by the respective outputs of labor and land, so: pN = wLN/XN + tTN/XN = waLN + taTN pU = wLU/XU + tTU/XU = waLU + taTU which merely states that the price of a commodity must equal the cost of production of a single unit of it (note our use of the definition of unit input coefficients). Now, from our definition of the real wage, w = cpN, so plugging that into our first price-cost equality: pN = cpNaLN + taTN and re-arranging: pN = taTN/(1 - caLN) we obtain the price of the necessary good. For the luxury good, we start by doing the same: pU = cpNaLU + taTU only now we use our expression for pN and obtain: pU = caLUtaTN/(1 - caLN) + taTU thus, solving for t/pU, after some algebraic manipulation: t/pU = (1 - caLN)/(aTU + caTNaTU(aLU/aTU - aLN/aTN)) where t/pU is the ""real rent"" rate. Thus, we have obtained expressions for real wages and real rents as a function of the ""technological"" coefficients. Thus, apparently, no other consideration was necessary. The factor prices seem to be completely determinate. Or are they? We have yet to find pN and pU, which express our ""real"" factor prices, w/pN and t/pU. This set of prices is exceedingly simple. We just multiply the expression for t/pU by our earlier expression for pN: pN(t/pU) = taTN(1 - caLN)/(1 - caLN)(aTU + caTNaTU(aLU/aTU - aLN/aTN)) or, cancelling out t and (1-caLN): pN/pU = aTN/(aTU + caTNaTU(aLU/aTU - aLN/aTN)) which thus expresses the price of commodities as a function of the technological coefficients, c, aLU, aTU, aLN, aTN. Thus, relative prices are completely determined by technological conditions alone. We need not add any other components (notably, preferences/utility-based demand) into our analysis. But Richard Cantillon sought to reduce labor to land. In other words, he felt that labor should not be thought as contributing to value (i.e. prices) but rather only land. Labor, as we noted, was a technologically-produced ""thing"" dependent on necessities. As a result, the only ""creator"" of value, Cantillon held, was land. Land contributed to prices ""directly"" (through their own contributions to production) and ""indirectly"" (through creating the necessities necessary to sustain labor). As he writes: ""the intrinsic value of any thing may be measured by the quantity of land used in its production and the quantity of labor which enter into it, in other words, by the quantity of land of which the produce is allotted to those who have worked on it; and as all the land belongs to the prince and the landowners, all things which have this intrinsic value have it only at their expense."" (Cantillon, 1755: Part 1, Ch. 11). How can we see this reduction of labor to land? Note that we have labor coefficients, aLU and aLN in our price equation but also note that these enter solely in the bracketed term in the denominator, (aLU/aTU - aLN/aTN). Now, these coefficient ratios are merely labor-land ratios, or factor intensity ratios: aLU/aTU is the ""labor per unit of land"" in producing luxuries and aLN/aTN is the ""labor per unit of land"" in producing necessities. We can alternatively think of these ratios as the ""amount of land necessary to sustain labor"". The greater the labor-intensity, the greater the amount of land ""indirectly absorbed"" (via labor) to produce goods. Note that if we have equal factor intensities in both sectors (aLU/aTU = aLN/aTN), then our price equation reduces to pN/pU = aTN/aTU, a pure land term. Note also that if luxuries are relatively more labor intensive, (i.e. aLU/aTU > aLN/aTN), then pN/pU < aU/aTN - or, in other words, the prices of luxuries are greater than necessities in terms of their direct land component because they have a greater ""indirect"" use of land (via labor). Similarly, if necessities are relatively more labor intensive, (i.e. aLU/aTU < aLN/aTN), then pN/pU > aTU/aTN, necessities are relatively more valuable than their pure land components indicate - again because of their greater indirect absorption of land. Thus, directly or indirectly, the relative amounts of land absorbed determine relative prices. We have reduced labor to land and thus we have a ""land theory of value"" - which Cantillon announced with his opening sentence: ""The land is the source or matter from whence all wealth is produced."" (Cantillon, 1755: p.2). So much for prices, but in a general equilibrium system, quantities must also be ascertained. In Cantillon's theory, these are easy to derive. Recall that we obtained the wage bill and rent bill equalities: wL = pNXN   or     w/pN = XN/L tT = pUXU     or      t/pU = XU/T thus, using our previous expressions for w/pN and t/pU, we obtain: XN/L = c XU/T = (1 - caLN)/(aTU + caTNaTU(aLU/aTU - aLN/aTN)) Everything is alright for XU, but what about XN? We can reduce the first term further by recalling that L = LN + LU = aLNXN + aLUXU by the definition of total labor and technology. Thus plugging that into our first term: XN(aLNXN + aLUXU) = c which, rearranging, yields: XN = caLUXU/(1 - caLN) But we can now plug in our expression for XU: XN = caLUT(1 - caLN)/(1 - caLN)(aTU + caTNaTU(aLU/aTU - aLN/aTN)) cancelling terms: XN = caLUT/(aTU + caTNaTU(aLU/aTU - aLN/aTN)) Finally, multiplying our term for XU/T by T: XU = (1 - caLN)T/(aTU + caTNaTU(aLU/aTU - aLN/aTN)) Et voilá! - we have the expressions for the ""equilibrium"" amounts of goods XN and XU produced. Again, note that they are functions solely of the technical coefficients and the amount of land in the economy, T. What about quantities of factors? Total land (T) was assumed fully employed by Cantillon. On the other hand, as we noted earlier, total labor (L) was presumed to be endogenous. The amount of labor employed can be easily calculated: namely, recall that L = aLNXN + aUXU, therefore all we need to do is to plug in the corresponding values of XN and XU we have just derived, i.e. L = (aLNcaLUT + aLU(1-caLN)T)/(aTU + caTNaTU(aLU/aTU - aLN/aTN)) or simply: L = aLUT/(aTU + caTNaTU(aLU/aTU - aLN/aTN)) which is labor employed - also a function of technical coefficients and the amount of land T. As we have seen, Cantillon had a fully-determined two-sector general equilibrium system; he had four markets, that of land, labor, luxuries and necessities and he could obtain four quantities and prices for them (where, naturally, all prices are ""relative"" prices, i.e. price ratios). The relative prices and relative quantities are determined by the relative absorption of land by the two goods, i.e. by the technical coefficients. The absolute quantities produced and the total level of employment vary directly with the total amount of land, T.   Selected References: H.

(Alexander Pushkin, Eugene Onegin, 1833: 1.VII) ""[A]lthough Adam Smith's great work professed to deal with the causes of the wealth of nations,...from the point of view of the history of theoretical economics, the central achievement of his book was his demonstration of the mode in which the division of labour tended to be kept in equilibrium by the mechanism of relative prices -- a demonstration which...is in harmony with the most refined apparatus of the modern School of Lausanne. The theory of value and distribution was really the central core of the analysis of the Classics, try as they might to conceal their objects under other names."" (Lionel C. Robbins, Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science, 1932: p.68-9). ""Political Economy, you think, is an enquiry into the nature and causes of wealth -- I think it should rather be called an enquiry into the laws which determine the division of produce of industry amongst the classes that concur in its formation. No law can be laid down respecting quantity, but a tolerably correct one can be laid down respecting proportions. Every day I am more satisfied that the former enquiry is vain and delusive, and the latter the only true object of the science."" (David Ricardo, ""Letter to T.R.

""I saw that [economists] were generally the very dregs and rinsings of the human intellect; and that any man of sound head, and practised in wielding logic with a scholastic adroitness, might take up the whole academy of modern economists, and throttle them between heaven and earth with his finger and thumb, or bray their fungus heads to powder with a lady's fan. At length, in 1819, a friend in Edinburgh sent me down Mr. Ricardo's book: and recurring to my own prophetic anticipation of the advent of some legislator for this science, I said, before I had finished the first chapter, ""Thou art the man!"".... Had this profound work been really written in England during the nineteenth century?....Could it be that an Englishman, and he not in academic bowers, but oppressed by mercantile and senatorial cares, had accomplished what all the universities of Europe, and a century of thought, had failed even to advance by one hair's breadth? All other writers had been crushed and overlaid by the enormous weight of facts and documents; Mr. Ricardo had deduced, a priori, from the understanding itself, laws which first gave a ray of light into the unwieldy chaos of materials, and had constructed what had been but a collection of tentative discussions into a science of regular proportions, now first standing on an eternal basis.""

von Neumann Systems,"Von Neumann System Back ________________________________________________________ ""The greatest single intellectual mistake in my career occurred when Schumpeter came to me in 1938 or '39 and asked me to report on a very important new publication: the von Neumann paper given at the Menger seminar...I rashly judged it to be totally unrealistic...[and] reported back to Schumpeter that it was no more than a piece of mathematical ingenuity, failing to see that it contained two aspects close to Schumpeter's heart - a rigorous solution to Walras's central problem and a demonstration that the rate of profit arose from growth not a quantity of capital...I found no reference [in Schumpeter's History] to what now appears to me to be one of the great seminal works of this century, the omission being possibly the result of my own blindness."" (Richard M. Goodwin, ""Personal Perspective on Mathematical Economics"", BNLQR, 1985). ________________________________________________________   Data  Activity Analysis Technology: There are k technological processes indexed m = 1....k. The ""intensity of use"" of the mth process denoted by coefficient 0 £zm£ 1. By intensity, we mean the proportion of the total economy that uses that process. Thus:
If, for any mth process, zm = 0, then the mth process is not used at all.
If zm = 1 then the mth process is used at ""full intensity"" (i.e. all the economy's output uses this process).
Thus the intensity of use of a single process, zm, is measured as the fraction of total output produced dedicated to using process m. Let there be n commodities indexed i = 1, ..., n.
ami denotes use of commodity i as an input in process m if m is used at full intensity.
bmi denotes output of commodity i by process m if m is used at full intensity. Thus: We have n prices, pi from i = 1...n normalized in a unit simplex (i.e. åpi = 1)  Conditions with No Growth: (1) Quantity Side: Let an economy be ""self-replacing"" (produces outputs that it needs as inputs with the same set of intensities). Thus, total output of good i from all processes must be sufficient to meet total demand for good i as an input into all processes:  If total output exceeds total input demand (strict inequality holds) for any good i then pi = 0 (excess supply of i implies i is a free good). Letting z be an intensity vector and A the input matrix (typical element = ami) and B the output matrix (typical element = bmi), this system can be rewritten:  (2) Price Side: Assuming an independent budget for each process and perfect competition (no rents), then total revenue obtained from the sale of output of a process cannot exceed the costs of inputs in the process:   Conditions (with growth) We assume intensity grows at the balanced exponential rate (1+g). Thus, zm(t+1) = (1+g)zm(t). Thus, for the quantity side, total outputs in this period must meet total input demands in the next period, i.e.  or:  Similarly, we assume a uniform rate of profit (surplus) which gives us a rate of decay of price: pi(t+1) = pi(t)/(1+r). Thus the surplus is transformed into a simple uniform rate of interest for intertemporal discounting. We thus obtain:   Further restrictions are imposed by von Neumann (1937) including non-negativity of z and p and the condition that every good is part of every process either as input or as output. This last was loosened by Kemeny, Morgenstern and Thompson (1956) and replaced with:  These are often known as the ""KMT"" conditions. An appropriate fixed point theorem proves existence of solution for quadruplet (z*, p*, g*, r*). Result There will be a pair (p*, z*) which solves our equation and gives us the Golden Rule, g* = r* for a maximal growth rate and a minimal interest rate. The Golden Rule can be easily shown. By the excess supply rule for free goods, then pre-multiplying the first equation by the price vector:  where the strict equality will hold by the free goods assumption. Similarly, by the excess cost rule, then post-multiplying the second equation by the intensity vector:  where the strict equality holds by the excess cost assumption. Then, obviously:  Thus the solution, the von Neumann ""ray"", will have maximum growth and minimal profit rate equal to each other (Golden Rule). Outline of Proof: John von Neumann used his 1928 game-theoretic ""minimax"" theorem of saddlepoint as contraction mapping:  i.e. if min and max are contractible for ¦(x0, y0), then ¦ has a saddle point. So, think of a game of ""Producer"" versus ""Competition"": Producer attempts to maximize growth, competition attempts to minimize profits. Recall that we want (z, g) from quantity side and (p, r) from price side. So game is as follows:  Competition (Price Side): for given p, take maximum r, i.e. (1+r) = maxm(pB/pA). Then choose p which yields the lowest of the maximum r, i.e. find p such that (1+r)* = minimaxm(pB/pA). Existence of minumum r* exists by KMT(2). Then construct mapping F (p, z) = pBz/pAz (which is positive by KMT(3)). von Neumann then shows that given a z = z0, then this function reaches a minimum for p whereas, given p = p0, then this function reaches a maximum for z. If there is a solution, then that solution is characterized as  so the solution to the system, F (p0, z0) = F(p*, z*), is the saddlepoint. Does it exist? Take a particular z0 and associated with this vector is a non-empty, convex, compact set of price vectors P(z0) each of which minimize the function F(p, z0). Equivalently, with some initial p0, we can associate a non-empty, convex, compact set of intensity vectors, Z(p0), each of which maximize the function F(p0, z). A ""fixed point"" is a pair of vectors (p*, z*) Î (P(z*), Z(p*)). von Neumann provides sufficient conditions for the existence of such a fixed point and proves that it is the saddlepoint.

(C) Substitution and Distribution Selected References Back (A) Factor Payments and the Concept of Rent The first thing to remember is this: in Neoclassical theory, factor prices and quantities employed are determined simultaneously by the supply and demand for factors. Period. If any of the ensuing discussion seems confusing, one can regain one's bearing by reminding one's self of this. This is the thread out of the labyrinth which follows. The second thing to remember is this: in all that follows, there are no produced factors of production, i.e. there is no capital. More precisely, for the rest of this discussion, the word ""capital"" is used in the same sense as ""land"", i.e. capital is assumed to be an endowed factor of production (which effectively contradicts the definition of capital! -- but more on that later).. For an analysis of the theory of distribution with capital properly speaking, turn to our discussion of capital theory. The reason for these initial warning is that the Neoclassical theory of distribution -- what has become known as the ""Marginal Productivity Theory of Distribution -- has been a subject of much debate and confusion since it was formulated in the 1890s.  We shall survey this debate here. Before proceeding, we ought to be clear about a few terms.  By ""distribution"" we mean the relative income received by the owners of factors of production. If L units of labor are employed in the economy, each unit being paid a wage w, then the income of laborers (the owners of labor) is wL. If K units of (fixed, endowed) capital are employed and paid a return r, then the income of capitalists (the owners of capital) is rK. If we denote by Y the economy-wide level of output, then the income share of labor can be expressed as wL/Y and the income share of capital is rK/Y. Consequently, the relative income shares of the capital and labor can be expressed as a ratio wL/rK. The distribution of income is about how total output in the economy Y, is divided up among people.  Edgeworth called it ""the species of exchange by which produce is divided between the parties who have contributed to its production "" (Edgeworth, 1904).  The laborers get wL, the capitalists get rK and, possibly, there might be some residual amount.  This residual amount,  the amount of income/output produced which is not paid back to the owners of capital and labor for factor services,  is  R = Y - rK - wL. The residual is usually paid out to a the class of people known as entrepreneurs.  It is important not to confuse this ""residual"" with the ""surplus"".  The ""surplus"" is defined as the amount of output that is not paid out to factors in reward for ""factor services.""  So, if we define r and w as the rate of return and wage in ""reward"" for factor services, the surplus is defined as  S = Y - rK - wL.  This seems mathematically similar to the entrepreneurial residual, but it is, in fact, quite different.  Explicit in the definition of the surplus is the assumption that r and w are what is called ""economic earnings"" alone.  In contrast, the r and w in the definition of the entrepreneurial residual include both economic earnings and ""rental earnings"".  So, if we define re and we as the economic earnings of capital and labor and rr and wr as their ""rental"" earnings, then the surplus is:     S = reK + weL while the entrepreneurial residual is:     R = (re+rr)K + (we + wr)L So, implicitly, while the residual accrues to the entrepreneur alone, the ""surplus"" includes amounts that accrue to labor and capital in the form of rental earnings. This may all seem a bit obscure and so we need to define things a bit better.  Just how do we distinguish payments for factor services from payments derived from the surplus, i.e. between economic earnings and rental earnings?  The difference differs in meaning between Classical and Neoclassical economists. However, in general, we can define them as follows: Economic earnings are that portion of factor payments by a producer which is necessary and sufficient to employ the particular factor, i.e. to obtain ""command"" of the factor services.  Rental earnings are any payments received by the factor above their economic earnings and as a result of their being in fixed supply. Turning to economic earnings, what does ""necessary and sufficient to employ a factor"" mean?  For the Classical Ricardian school, the economic earnings of a factor are merely the payments necessary to maintain the factor ""intact"".   Thus, for laborers, economic earnings are wages required to keep the laborer alive and well, i.e. ""subsistence"" wages. (for capital, the story is more complicated; see our discussion of Classical capital theory).  Although some Neoclassicals have agreed to this Classical definition, most have taken on the Austrian definition of economic earnings in terms of opportunity costs. If a producer wishes to secure the employment of a particular factor, it has to pay that factor at least what it might receive in alternative employments. This is the opportunity cost of the factor. So, if a factor is paid $7 an hour by a particular producer and could find alternative employment only for $5 an hour, then the factor's opportunity cost (and thus its economic earnings) are $5 and its surplus earnings are $2. We can fix our ideas better by examining the factor market equilibrium for a particular factor. An example for the labor market is shown in Figure 1. The Ld curve is the economy-wide demand for labor by firms, Ls is the economy-wide supply of labor by households. The demand for labor is downward sloping with respect to the wage for reasons that have already been extensively analyzed in the Neoclassical theory of production: specifically, as the wage increases (holding all other factor prices constant), firms will choose techniques of production that substitute away from labor and towards other factors. We know, from profit-maximization, that they will choose to employ labor until the marginal value product is equal to the wage. Thus, heuristically, the labor demand curve Ld can be seen as the economy-wide marginal value product of labor curve (if we can define such a thing as an economy-wide MVP!). The labor supply curve is upward sloping because of labor-leisure choice issues: the greater the wage, the greater the opportunity cost of leisure, and thus the more households substitute away from leisure and towards labor. Fig. 1 - Factor Market Equilibrium Factor market equilibrium is established where the economy-wide demand for labor Ld is equal to the economy-wide supply of labor (Ls). In Figure 1, this will be at w*, where Ld = Ls. Notice that at a lower wage, e.g. w1, there is an excess demand for labor as Ld = L3 > L1 = Ls. At a higher wage, e.g. w3, we have excess supply of labor as Ld = L1 < L3 = Ls. The wage w* in Figure 1 is the equilibrium wage. Equilibrium quantity is L*, thus economy-wide labor earnings are, in equilibrium, w*L*, the area of the box formed by 0L*ew* in Figure 1. Economic earnings and rental earnings are noted in Figure 1 by the areas E (for economic earnings) and R (for rental earnings). The reasoning for labelling the R and E areas in this manner can be readily understood. When we are at the factor market equilibrium (w*, L*), every worker is individually paid the equilibrium wage, w*. However, it may be that some of these workers might have been willing to work at a lower wage. They nonetheless receive w*. For instance, notice in Figure 1 that at wage w1, the amount of labor supplied is L1. Thus, the ""economic earnings"" of the first L1 workers, the payment that would have been sufficient to command their labor, is not more than w1. However, in equilibrium, these same set of workers, L1, are paid the equilibrium wage w*, which is considerably higher than w1. This principle applies to all the ""intramarginal"" workers supplied between zero and L*. Thus, the area below the labor supply curve reflects economic earnings, while the area above the labor supply curve reflects, as we shall see, rental earnings. We spoke earlier that economic earnings are payments required to command labor, which, we noted, in the Austrian sense, are conceived as opportunity cost payments. Opportunity cost is captured by the shape of the labor supply curve. In this simplified scenario, we can conceive of the ""alternative"" employment of the laborers to be ""leisure"". Thus, the greater the ""rewards"" of leisure, the lower will be the labor supply at any wage rate (i.e. Ls shifts left) and thus the greater the wage required to command any laborer and thus the higher the economic earnings of any employed laborer. Note the implications of the two extreme scenarios, both depicted in Figure 2. Suppose leisure is so disliked that, in fact, workers do not consider it a gainful alternative to employment. In this case, the labor supply curve is vertical as shown by Ls in Figure 2. In other words, any wage rate will call forth the entire labor force. Now, equilibrium will still be where the labor demand and vertical labor supply curve meet at e, thus we still have a strictly positive equilibrium wage, w* > 0 and strictly positive labor earnings (the area of the box, w*L*). However, notice that now that all earnings of labor, w*L*, are rental earnings and economic earnings are nil.  Conversely, suppose labor supply is supplied with infinite elasticity, i.e. we have a horizontal labor supply curve such as Ls¢ in Figure 2. In this case, an infinite amount of labor is supplied when the wage is greater than w* and no labor is supplied when the wage is below w*. Labor earnings are still defined at equilibrium e as the area of the box w*L*. However, note that now equilibrium labor income w*L* will be entirely composed of economic earnings and no rental earnings are received. Figure 2 - Pure Rental versus Pure Economic Earnings The reasoning for these two extreme cases is readily apparent. When the labor supply is inelastic (vertical Ls), i.e. when there is no alternative employment, then any earnings made by labor must necessarily arise because firms are fighting over a limited supply of them.  In other words, firms are bidding up their wages ""artificially"" above what is necessary to get them to work.  The supply of workers will be L* regardless of what the wage offered is. As such, workers are experiencing a windfall gain in this case: they would be willing to work for less, much less (indeed, near zero), but competition among firms has bid their wages up regardless. In contrast, when the labor supply is perfectly elastic (horizontal Ls¢), then there are no ""intramarginal"" workers. In other words, at least w* is necessary to call forth any labor and, furthermore, w* calls forth an infinite amount of labor. Labor supply is not finite at w*. This implies that, as long as firms pay at least w*, they do not need to ""fight"" each other over a limited supply of workers. As there is no ""bidding war"" ensuing from limited labor supply, firms will have no incentive to pay workers above their minimal opportunity cost wage, w*. These examples permit us to better define the meaning of rental earnings of a factor as that portion of earnings that arise purely out of the fact that the factor is in fixed supply. This concept of rent, or differential rent or Ricardian rent as it has been variously called, was introduced simultaneously but independently by T.R. Malthus (1815), Robert Torrens (1815), Edward West (1815) and David Ricardo (1815), and became one of  cornerstones of the Classical Ricardian theory of distribution. Classical theory generally did not assume that factors were fixed in supply: in other words, they assumed that capital and labor could be ""produced"".  In terms of Figure 2, they believed the labor supply curve was horizontal so that all payments to labor were economic earnings.  However, following David Ricardo (1815, 1817) they recognized that land was fixed in supply and thus that land made rental earnings.   Figure 3 illustrates the Classical Ricardian theory of rent. Here we are assuming only two factors of production: labor (L) and land (T), where the labor is completely variable but land is in fixed supply. The production function is thus Y = ¦ (L, T0), where T0 is the fixed total supply of land. In contrast labor is supplied with infinite elasticity (a typical Classical assumption). This is captured in Figure 3 by the infinitely-elastic labor supply curve, Ls, at the subsistence wage rate, w. Fig. 3 - Ricardian (Differential) Rent The horizontal axis in Figure 3 measures different amounts of labor being applied to the fixed amount of land. The curves APL and MPL are the ""economically-relevant"" portions of the average product and marginal product of labor curves (i.e. the portions where marginal product of labor is diminishing and below the average product curve, what Ricardo called the portion above the extensive margin; see our discussion on marginal products). The Classical Ricardian story now proceeds as follows. For a given amount of land, the more labor we apply to it, the smaller the marginal and average products. This the Classicals conceived as a natural truth with regard to agriculture alone. The basic idea was that land was in fixed supply and of differing quality. The most fertile lands were always used first and the less fertile ones only used later. Thus, the more the scale of production increases (i.e. the more dollops of labor are applied), the increasingly worse land would be taken into cultivation and thus the lower the productivity of labor on the marginal piece of land. Now, the Ricardians argued that at least enough output must be generated to pay for the factors of production. The wage paid to labor is w and this reflects economic earnings entirely, i.e. must cover ""subsistence"".  In contrast, land, although a factor of production, does not need to paid for. One can justify this in Classical terms by saying it does not need to be maintained intact; in Neoclassical terms, this implies there are no alternative uses for land and thus no opportunity costs to be compensated. However, and this is the gist of the Classical Ricardian story, although land makes no economic earnings, we see that because land is fixed in supply, it takes receives rental earnings. In fact, as we shall see, in Figure 3, all surplus in production resolves itself into rental payments for land. To see this, note that we can increase the scale of production, and thus take in more land and apply more labor, up until the marginal product of labor is equal to the subsistence wage. This will be at L* in Figure 3. Thus, total wage payments wL* are the area of the light-shaded box in Figure 3. Now, at L*, average product is y = Y/L*. Thus, total output is Y = yL*, i.e. the area of the box 0L*ay (alternatively, we could have represented total output as the sum of the light-shaded box and the triangle ewb formed under the MPL curve; the areas are equivalent). Consequently, the surplus produced, defined as Y - wL, is the darkly shaded box in Figure 3. This is the amount of output that is produced over and above payments to factors. This remainder, the early Classicals contended, accrues to landowners, thus it is referred to as rent. (B) The Marginal Productivity Theory of Distribution (i) The Product Exhaustion Theorem The1871-4 Marginalist Revolution demolished the Classical Ricardian theory of value.  However, the Classical theory of distribution lingered on for a little while.  In the 1890s, however, the Neoclassicals finally put forth their own theory -- the ""Marginal Productivity"" theory of distribution -- that was at the same a generalization and repudiation of the the Classical Ricardian story. Despite its late appearance, a general marginal productivity theory of factor price determination was already ""in the air"" by the 1870s.  We see hints of it in the work of J.H. von Thünen (1826-50), Mountiford Longfield (1834) and Francis A. Walker (1876).  But it was not until the1890s that the Marginalists realized that the Ricardian ""law of rent"" applied to all  factors and not merely land -- and that a new theory of distribution could be built on that basis.  This realization was first forwarded by John Bates Clark (1889, 1891) and John A. Hobson (1891).  Clark and Hobson realized a very simple thing: the Classicals had claimed that the supply of labor is endogenous (""men multiply like mice in a barn..."", etc.) while the supply of land is fixed and does not vary. But, at least in theory,  there is nothing ""special"" about the fixity of the supply of land and the variability in the supply of labor. If we hold one factor fixed and vary the other, the rent principle should apply regardless: the quantity of the varying factor should be set where its economic earnings are equal to its marginal product.  To see this, suppose that instead of varying the amount of labor applied to a fixed amount of land, why not apply varying amounts of land to a fixed amount of labor? In this case, the horizontal axis in Figure 3 would be T, the amount of land, and the curves MP and AP curves would reflect the marginal product and average product of land. Stipulating a fixed payment per unit of land (analogous to the wage), and we would reach the same conclusion: land would be employed up until its payment per unit is equal to its marginal product. Total output would still by the entire box, with the lightly-shaded box representing payments to land and the remainder (the dark-shaded box) representing payments to the other factors - in this case, labor. The Classicals were not unaware of this possibility.  However, they contended that factor shares, computed in this way, would fail to ""add up"" to total output. To see this, suppose we have a three factor economy, Y = ¦ (L, K, T), where L is labor, K is capital, and T is land.  Now, suppose we try calculating the returns on the factor via this procedure.  Consequently, varying L and leaving K and T fixed, we end up with the result that payments to labor are ¦ LL and the residual Y - ¦ LL will be paid to capital and land, so defining w as the wage, r as the return on capital and t as the rate of payment on land, then:     wL =  ¦ LL     rK + tT = Y - ¦ LL If instead we vary K and leave L and T fixed, we end up with capital payments being ¦ KK and the residual Y - ¦ KK being paid to labor and land.     rK =  ¦ KK     wL + tT = Y - ¦ KK  Finally, if we vary T and leave K and L fixed, then     tT =  ¦TT     wL + rK = Y - ¦TT So far so good. The more enlightened Classical economists would say that, yes, perhaps such a calculation could be made, but that it revealed nothing about the theory of distribution.   Now it must be true that (if no entrepreneurial gains are made) Y = wL + rK + tT and this will be the case if any of the three cases given above hold.  It is a simple accounting principle.  Thus, the Classicals were willing to admit, to some extent, that there was nothing ""special"" about the fixity of land and the flexibility of capital-and-labor in principle, that marginal products could be calculated by fixing other things and and varying other things.    But such exercises, the Classicals contended, revealed nothing about distribution because there is no reason to presume that all three cases hold simultaneously.   In other words, it is not necessarily true that when calculating factor payments by marginal products, i.e. setting w = ¦ L, r = ¦ K and t = ¦ T, that the sums of factor payments will add up to total product:     Y = ¦ LL + ¦ KK + ¦TT Thus, the Classicals concluded, exercises that try to calculate marginal products of other factors serve no real end as they will not ""add up"".   But  John Bates Clark (1889, 1891) contended that this equality would hold.  In other words, he asserted that when each factor is paid its marginal product, the sum of factor incomes will exhaust total output. This proposition became known as the marginal productivity theory of distribution or the product-exhaustion theorem. Clark himself provided a rather loose verbal ""proof"" of this contention.  Philip H. Wicksteed (1894) was the first to prove it mathematically.  However, Wicksteed also revealed that there was a necessary condition for this to hold: namely, the aggregate production function must be linearly homogeneous.  Specifically, if the aggregate production function Y = ¦ (K, L, T) is homogeneous of degree one, then if each factor was paid its marginal product, then income shares would indeed ""add up"". Wicksteed's proof, as A.W. Flux (1894) noted in his review, was a simple application of Euler's Theorem . Namely, by Euler's Theorem, if a function is homogeneous of degree r, then, then:     rY = ¦ LL + ¦ KK + ¦TT where ¦i is the first derivative of the function with respect to the ith argument.  Consequently, if, as Wicksteed proposes, the production function is homogeneous of degree one, so r = 1, then:     Y = ¦ LL + ¦ KK + ¦TT But this is precisely the product-exhaustion result we were looking for! So, in sum, the marginal productivity theorem of distribution says that  if all factors are paid their marginal products, then the sum of factor incomes will add up to total product.   (ii) Early Debates on Marginal Productivity The marginal productivity theory caused something of a little tornado around the turn-of-the-century, which deserve some attention as they helped clarify what the theory says and what it does not say [accounts of the debates surrounding marginal productivity abound -- those of Joan Robinson (1934), George Stigler (1941: Ch. 12) and John Hicks (1932, 1934) are probably the best. Also worthwhile are the accounts by Henry Schultz (1929), Dennis H. Robertson (1931) and Paul Douglas (1934)]. One of the immediate debates surrounded that of priority.  Who ""discovered"" the marginal productivity theory of distribution? The first verbal exposition of the marginal productivity hypothesis is due to John Bates Clark (1889), which was followed up in Clark (1890, 1899) and, independently, Hobson (1891).  Largely unaware of Clark, Philip H. Wicksteed (1894) presented the same theory and proved the product-exhaustion theorem mathematically, although, as noted, it was A.W. Flux (1894) who noted the equivalence between Wicksteed's mathematical statement and Euler's Theorem. Here a few strange footnotes begin. Enrico Barone had discovered marginal productivity theory independently, but his work was published after he had become aware of Wicksteed's achievement (Barone, 1895, 1896), thus his claim to priority was unluckily lost.  Barone convinced Léon  Walras to incorporate the marginal productivity theory in the third 1896 edition of his Elements (lesson 36) but then Walras affixed a famous ill-spirited note (App. 3) commending Wicksteed's performance yet claiming that the theorem was already implicit in his early work, and thus that it should be he (Walras), and not Wicksteed, that should be given credit for discovering it. This blatantly opportunistic move outraged even Walras's supporters, and he duly withdrew the note in the fourth edition of his book.  During this sorry affair,  Knut Wicksell (1900) rose to defend of Wicksteed's claim as discoverer of the theory.  But in a surprising twist, it turns out that Wicksell had actually discovered it  himself in 1893 -- before Wicksteed -- and had just forgotten about it!  To add a bizarre finale, it turns out that a Lausanne mathematician, Hermann Amstein, had basically handed Walras the entire product-exhaustion theorem and its proof in 1877, but Walras had not understood the mathematics and consequently ignored it (cf. Jaffé, 1964). Despite the fight over priority, the marginal productivity theory of distribution was not immediately embraced by other economists, not even the other Neoclassicals, largely because it was not clear what the theorem said nor what its implications were. As such, it might be useful to clarify a few points of confusion. The first and most straightforward error (which is sometimes repeated today) is to assume that the marginal productivity theory says that factor prices are determined by marginal products. The tone of the exposition in John Bates Clark (1899) sometimes implies this, and many contemporaries took it at face value. As such, loose critics have gone on to ""prove"" that the marginal productivity theory is contradictory because it claims that factor prices are determined by marginal products and yet the theory of production tells us quite the opposite, namely that the amount of factors employed (and thus their marginal products) depend on factor prices. The argument is circular, critics claim, ergo the marginal productivity theory is faulty. The absurdity of this ""proof"" is evident when one recognizes that the marginal productivity theory does not say that marginal products determine factor prices. It has never said that, regardless of whatever Clark let himself say in unguarded moments. Factor prices and factor quantities are determined by the demand and supply of factors, period. The theory of production, which makes marginal products dependent on factor prices, gives us only a factor demand schedule and not the equilibrium position.    In other words,  at equilibrium, factors are paid their marginal products because, by definition, equilibrium is the equality of demand and supply and, by derivation from the theory of the producer, the demand curve is a marginal product schedule.  There is thus no ""one-way"" causality between factor payments and marginal products.  At best, as Dennis Robertson (1931) suggests, factor payments are the measure of marginal products in equilibrium and consequently, the marginal productivity theory can be regarded as a mere technical characterization of that equilibrium. .  As Alfred Marshall aptly warns us: ""This [marginal productivity] doctrine has sometimes been put forward as a theory of wages. But there is no valid ground for any such pretension. The doctrine that the earnings of a worker tend to be equal to the net product of his work, has by itself no real meaning; since in order to estimate net product, we have to take for granted all the expenses of production of the commodity on which he works, other than his own wages. But though this objection is valid against a claim that it contains a theory of wages; it is not valid against a claim that the doctrine throws into clear light the action of one of the causes that govern wages."" (A. Marshall, 1890: p.429-30) This warning repeated by Gustav Cassel: ""marginal productivity itself is not an objectively ascertained factor in the pricing problem, but is in fact one of the unknowns in the problem...[A factor's] marginal productivity, then, cannot be defined as anything other than [its] price, for this price represents precisely the contribution of the labour in question to the price of the product. The statement that wages are determined by the marginal productivity of labour thus loses all independent meaning."" (G. Cassel, 1918: 312-313) The second misleading element is to take John Bates Clark's argument that marginal productivity is a natural law or one that is necessarily ""moral"" at face value. The following paragraph from his master tome reveals the gist of his claims: ""If each productive function is paid for according to the amount of its product, then each man get what he himself produces. If he works, he gets what he creates by working; if he provides capital, he gets what his capital produces; and if, further, he renders service by coordinating labor and capital, he gets the product that can be separately traced to that function. Only in one of these ways can a man produce anything. If he receives all that he brings into existence through any one of these three functions, he receives all that he creates at all."" (J.B.Clark, 1899: p.7) The tone of Clark's assertion have led many to think he was referring to the intramarginal worker. This has led critics like George Bernard Shaw to respond in kind: ""[T]hat of giving to every person exactly what he or she has made by his or her labor, seems fair; but when we try to put it into practice we discover, first, that it is quite impossible to find out how much each person has produced."" (G.B. Shaw, 1928: p.21) To see the issues involved, it is best to be clear with an example. Suppose that we have an enterprise which uses one unit of land which can produce ten units of output.  Adding a unit of labor, we   applying successive laborers to a field, we have the following: Qty. of Labor Total Product Average Product Marginal Product One Laborer 10 10 10 Two Laborers 18 9 8 Three Laborers 24 8 6 Let us assume (for the sake of argument, for this is not implied), that the average product represents the actual contribution of the laborer to total output. So, one laborer alone contributes 10 units of output, two laborers contribute 9 each, three laborers contribute 8 each. But, except for the first case, the factors are not paid what they contribute: they are paid the marginal product. Thus, when there are two laborers, each contributing 9, each of them only receives 8 units in wage payments. When there are three, each contributing 8, they each only receive 6 units in wage payments.   If laborers are paid their marginal product, we hardly have ""moral justice"" in this case!   Of course, the perceptive should have noticed immediately that the product exhaustion theorem does not hold in this example as the sum of factor payments is less than the total product.  That is because we have not assumed constant returns to scale in this example.  Under constant returns to scale, the marginal product will be equal to average product and so,  in that case, the payment to a factor in our example will indeed be equal to its contribution and thus Clarkian ""moral justice"" is achieved.   But the lesson should be clear: ""moral justice"" does not arise merely from paying factors their marginal product; that could be unjust if we do not have constant returns.  But if constant returns to scale applies, then paying workers their marginal products may be considered just.  Do we still obtain ""moral justice"" when we change the assumption about what each laborer contributes to output?  Suppose that the contribution of each individual labor in the table above is actually the marginal product, rather than the average product.  In other words, suppose the first laborer actually contributes 10, the second laborer contributes 8 and the third laborer contributes 6.  By the theory, they all get paid 6. As the first laborer contributes 10 but only gets paid 6, do we then say that he did not receive what he contributed?  Is Clarkian ""moral justice"" violated?  Not quite.  If three laborers, Mr. A, Mr. B and Mr. C, are all of the same type and quality, then there is no meaning to ""first"", ""second"" or ""third"".  The ""first"" laborer contributes 10, but when all three workers are in the field, one cannot determine who exactly was the ""first"".  If A happened to be the first and C the last on the field that morning, then A contributed 10 and  C contributed 6. (recall, we are actually assuming that each individual is contributes his marginal product!)  If we ""reshuffle"" the order of entry, so that C enters first and A enters last, then A contributed 6 and C contributed 10.  Thus, there is no definite way of identifying who was the ""first"", ""second"", etc. But suppose we can.  Suppose that Mr. A is indeed always the ""first"", in the sense of being the laborer that always contributes 10 and that Mr. C is always the ""last"" in the sense of being the laborer that always contributes 6, regardless of how we reshuffle the order of worker entry onto the field.   But this is equivalent to saying that the three workers are not a ""homogeneous"" factor class.   Each worker forms a distinct ""factor class"" unto himself.  We can identify the marginal product of each of the individual workers (i.e. factor classes) and thus we ought to pay them differently, i.e. Mr. A receiving 10 and Mr. C receiving 6.  There is no confusion in this case.  The way in which George Bernard Shaw's remark can make sense, as pointed out by Pareto (1897) and Cassel (1918), is if factors are used in fixed proportions. In this case, it may be impossible to measure the marginal product of a factor type (one can visualize this by attempting to determine the slope of the Leontief isoquant at the corner). At any rate, we should note that Clark's moral justice argument can be and was seen as an apology for income distribution in capitalist systems -- marginal productivity ""is true to the principle on which the right of property rests"" (Clark, 1899: p.v). -- and, as a result, attracted the ire of socialists. However, socialist arguments are not, in principle, disabled by this: marginal productivity determines the share of income going to capital, but it is another issue altogether whether capital is privately or publicly owned. One can believe in the marginal productivity theory of distribution and still advocate that all capital ought to be social.  Indeed, one of the major features of Soviet planning in the post-Stalin era was precisely the use of the principle of marginal productivity in pricing factors. The third difficulty lies in the homogeneity assumption. How credible an assumption is this? Wicksteed asserted, rather tentatively, that constant returns are generally true. His somewhat garbled argument was that if we consider every type of every factor as a ""unique"" and separate factor, then ""on this understanding it is of course obvious that a proportional increase in all factors of production will secure a proportional increase in output"" (Wicksteed, 1894: p.33). This, of course, is a poor justification for a linear homogeneous production function: if every unit of every factor is unique, the meaning of marginal product becomes confusing (albeit, see the modern restatement of Wicksteed's theory by Makowski and Ostroy, 1992). Thus, he concludes: ""Our law then may be regarded as perfectly general....In this form, it is not a theory of distribution, but an analytical and synthetical law of composition and resolution of industrial factors and products, which would hold equally in Robinson Crusoe's island, an American religious commune, in an Indian village ruled by custom, and in competitive centres of the typical modern industries."" (P.H. Wicksteed, 1894: p.42) Wicksteed was understandably taken to task by his fellow economists for this outlandish statement of universality of application. Vilfredo Pareto (1897, 1901) led the way, chastising Wicksteed and arguing that the assumption of constant returns production was far less applicable than he thought. This was reiterated by Francis Y. Edgeworth (1904, 1911) and Chapman (1906): constant returns to scale evidently ignored the reality of monopoly, indivisibilities of production and thus differing returns to scale which permeate the ""real world"". Wicksteed's claim was famously derided by Edgeworth: ""This is certainly a remarkable discovery; for the relation between product and factors is to be considered to hold good irrespectively of the play of the market...There is a magnificence in this generalization which recalls the youth of philosophy. Justice is a perfect cube, said the ancient sage; and rational conduct is a homogeneous function, adds the modern savant."" (F.Y. Edgeworth, 1904). Consequently, Phillip Wicksteed, in his later works (e.g. 1910), withdrew this claim of generality. Léon Walras (1874: Ch. 36) and subsequently Knut Wicksell (1901, 1902) offered a solution to Wicksteed's dilemma: constant returns to scale, they argued, need not be assumed to hold for production functions. However, perfect competition ensures that producers will produce at the point of minimum average cost, i.e. at the point in their production function where there is constant returns to scale. Thus, the possibility of increasing/decreasing returns to scale can be ignored: competition effectively ensures that constant returns will hold in equilibrium. (see our discussion of the theory of the firm). Note that Wicksteed (1894: p.35) had been aware that monopolistic situations, where entrepreneurs made positive profits, were inconsistent with constant returns and thus that perfect competition was a necessary precondition for his theorem. However, what he had not noticed, and what Walras and Wicksell insisted upon, was that perfect competition implies constant returns to scale in equilibrium. Léon Walras's argument (Walras, 1874: Ch. 36) was subtle but rigorous. What he sought to demonstrate was the following: firstly, that under perfect competition, firms produce at minimum average cost; secondly, the result that factors of production will be paid their marginal products is implied by the assumption of a cost-minimizing firms. Ergo, Walras concludes, in a perfectly competitive equilibrium, there will be constant returns to scale and thus the marginal productivity theory follows through.  Although Walras's argument, as he originally stated it, is a bit confusing (cf. H. Schultz, 1929; J. Hicks, 1934; H. Neisser, 1940), it was made considerably clearer and more accessible by Knut Wicksell.  Wicksell's (1901, 1902) argument ran something as follows.  Consider the following scenario: suppose there are no entrepreneurs and that either capitalists or laborers can own and run the enterprise. The question is this: would capitalists enjoy being the owners of the enterprise - in which case they hire labor, pay them their marginal products and then take the residual as their own income - or would they prefer to be employees - in which case, they are hired by labor, receive their marginal products as income, while the laborer-owners take the residual. Under constant returns to scale, it makes no difference: as the marginal productivity theory shows, ¦ KK = Y - ¦ LL, so that the residual the capitalists would get as owners (Y - ¦ LL) is identical to the payment they would receive as employees (¦ KK). However, suppose now that we have diminishing returns to scale so that, by Euler's Theorem : y > å i=1m ¦ i·xi thus factor payments fail to exhaust output (incidentally, this was pointed out by Knut Wicksell (1901: p.128) using a Cobb-Douglas production function). In this case, ¦ KK < Y - ¦ LL, thus the residual income the capitalist gets as an owner is greater than what he would receive as an employee. Conversely, under increasing returns to scale, Euler's Theorem implies that: y < å i=1m ¦ i·xi so if factors are paid their marginal products, then total factor payments will exceed output. Thus, ¦ KK > Y - ¦ LL, i.e. the capitalist would earn more as an employee than he would earn as an employer.  The same story can be applied to laborer's decisions on whether to own or be employed in an enterprise. Thus, Wicksell informs us, the general rule is this: under decreasing returns to scale, all factors will prefer to be owners; under increasing returns, all factors will prefer to be employees; and under constant returns, the factors do not care whether they are owners or employees. Suppose, Wicksell suggests, that we do indeed have decreasing returns to scale and perfect competition. All factors would thus desire to become owners and consequently they would all try to set up their own enterprises and hire each other. This would lead to a bidding up of factor prices that would eat into the profits made by the residual earner. In other words, the extra amount these aspiring entrepreneurs would make as employers would be dissipated by their competition to employ factors. Conversely, suppose we are under increasing returns to scale so that all factors prefer to be employees rather than employers; the bidding process would work in reverse, and factor prices would fall. Thus, Wicksell concludes, the only point consistent with stable competition would be where factors are indifferent between being employees or employers, i.e. the constant returns to scale case. John Bates Clark had recognized effectively the same problem and offered the same solution: ""It is clear that one group cannot keep its profit-making position in the system, if entrepreneurs who are making no such net gains are at liberty to enter it. May not all entrepreneurs be making the same rate of profits, and making them at the same time? Clearly not: for it would be an universal invitation to capitalists to become entrepreneurs and, as such, to bid against each other for labor and capital till the profit should everywhere vanish, by being made over to laborers and capitalists in the shape of additional wages and interest."" (J.B. Clark, 1899: p.290-1). Notice that these arguments reiterate Walras's old idea (cf. Walras, 1874: p.225-6) that under perfect competition, the entrepreneur makes ""no profit"" -- which, in this context, means that the owner receives no more in residual income than he would receive as an employed factor of production. However, it was this very definition of ""profit"" that irked unsympathetic commentators such as Edgeworth (1904). A fourth objection to the marginal productivity theory was set forth by John A. Hobson (1910, 1911) and Albert Aftalion (1911). They argued that when one re-defines the concept of marginal product in terms of loss, the definition which Carl Menger (1871) had used, then if all factors are paid their marginal product, it will not ""add up"". To see this, consider the example offered even earlier by Friedrich von Wieser (1889: p.83): suppose three units of a factor are employed in the ""best"" enterprise which, jointly, produces 10 units of output. The alternative use of each of these factors by itself yields 3 units each. Consequently, removing a factor means that the remaining two units produce 3 each and thus a total of 6. Consequently, the removal of the third factor has reduced output from 10 to 6. Thus, the marginal product of the factor, computed in the Menger-Hobson loss form, is 4. Yet if each factor was indeed paid 4, then, added up, the total payments would be 12, which more than exhausts total product available (10). As Alfred Marshall (1890: p.339n.1) and, more satisfactorily, F.Y. Edgeworth (1904) and John Bates Clark (1901) pointed out, Hobson's argument relies on the fact that he was using large units to compute marginal products. Marginal units are infinitesimal - i.e. ¦i = ¶¦/¶xi is the marginal product of the ith factor - and if ¦i is defined, then the marginal productivity theorem holds true. Note that Hobson's argument can hold true in the non-differentiable case. Suppose we have a Leontief production function: Y = min {K/v, L/u} where v is the required capital-output ratio and v the required labor-output ratio. By Hobson's definition, removing a marginal unit of capital will reduce output by 1/u, thus this is the marginal product of capital. Similarly, 1/v would be Hobson's marginal productivity of labor. Consequently, if factors are paid their marginal products, total factor income is K/v + L/v, which is certainly greater than Y. But is the marginal productivity theorem always disabled in the non-differentiable case? No. How does the marginal productivity theory of distribution work when the production function is not differentiable, e.g. of the activity analysis sort? This question leads us the fixed coefficients equilibrium models of Léon Walras (1874), Friedrich von Wieser (1889), Vilfredo Pareto (1906), Gustav Cassel (1918) and Abraham Wald (1936), thus we must refer to our review of the Walras-Cassel model for the complete answer. Nonetheless, a few brief remarks may be worthwhile making here (cf. Schultz, 1929; Hicks, 1932, 1934). We must differentiate between two central questions when facing non-smooth technology: firstly, that of the determinacy of factor prices and quantities; secondly, of whether one somehow conceive that factor prices will be equal to the ""marginal products"" of the relevant factors in some manner. The determinacy question is swiftly answered: in the Walras-Cassel model, fixed coefficient production models will yield us determinate factor prices if the following conditions hold: (1) prices of all processes are set equal to their cost of production (""perfect competition""); (2) if there are m factors of production, then there are at least m output processes that employ all the m factors. Condition (1) is familiar: knowing output prices, we can immediately determine factor prices in Walras-Cassel models (even though these may be negative, etc.). However, it does not work unless condition (2) is also imposed. What this means, effectively, is that indeterminacy can arise if the number of processes using the factors is less than the number of factors. Thus, the Hobsonesque instance we proposed earlier, a traditional Leontief production function, fails the determinacy condition (2) because it employs two factor (K and L) and only one output process. In terms of Walras-Cassel diagrams, this is equivalent to having only one price-cost equality determining two factor prices: clearly, factor prices would be indeterminate in this case. So, if factor prices are determinate, are they equal to marginal products? This will be true, if we define the marginal product of a factor as the increase in output that arise from the marginal release of the relevant factor supply constraint. In other words, the marginal productivity of a factor is merely the shadow value of the factor supply constraint. As the Walras-Cassel-Wald model  indicates, this shadow value will be precisely the factor prices determined in the primal exercise. Thus, factor prices are equal to marginal products. In sum, the marginal productivity theory of distribution holds good in activity-analysis type of general equilibrium models in spite of the fact that we cannot differentiate the production function to derive the marginal product as a derivative. It comes in as a shadow value. A final point we wish to make regards Alfred Marshall's unique formulation of marginal productivity theory (cf. Marshall, 1890: p.426-30). For Marshall, the marginal product of a factor should be computed only once all other factors have been adjusted to their optimal values -- what he called the net marginal product. In other words, Marshall recognized the marginal product concept can be a bit misleading: the marginal product of labor is the change in output that results from an increased employment of a unit of labor. But what if the resulting factor proportions are not optimal for the entrepreneur? What if, as a result of employing a unit of labor, he decides to let go or add on an extra unit of capital as well? Marshall's proposed the concept of net marginal product to solve the problem (cf. Hicks, 1932: p.12-15; Machlup, 1937). The net marginal product of labor can be defined as the increase in output that arises from the employment of an extra unit of labor after we allow all other factors to be adjusted to their new optimal (i.e. profit-maximizing) levels. Mathematically, we can conceive of this by employing the profit function, p (p, w, r). Let us define the following: p (p, w, r) - wL = max [pY - wL - rK] - wL as net profits, or profits minus labor costs, evaluated at the optimal, profit-maximizing position. Consequently, Marshall's net marginal product of labor can be defined as ¶p /¶ L, i.e. the product of an extra unit of labor minus the value of inputs cooperating with labor when the levels of these inputs are chosen optimally. Notice that in a position of maximum net profits (as in equilibrium), we have from the first order conditions that ¶ p /¶ L = w, i.e. the net marginal product is equal to the wage. It is in terms of net marginal products that Marshall goes on to formulate his marginal productivity theory. (C) Substitution and Distribution One of the interesting results from empirical analysis of income distributions is that relative income shares do not tend to vary much over time, i.e. the relative share of capital in income rK/Y and the relative share of labor in income wL/Y have been rather constant. This has been noticed at least as far back as John Maynard Keynes (1939) and has been so repeatedly confirmed by empirical studies that Nicholas Kaldor (1961) considered it to be one of the ""stylized facts"" about the economy. Now, constancy of relative income shares does not contradict the marginal productivity theory of distribution. But neither is it implied by it. This has led some economists, notably Nicholas Kaldor (1955), to call for the abandonment of the marginal productivity theory of distribution as it does not ""explain"" this stylized fact. Others, such as Robert Solow (1958), have disputed its empirical validity. But there are other more plausible hypotheses to explain the constancy of distribution in terms of the marginal productivity theory. One is that the capital-labor ratio k = K/L has itself been constant over time. This is possible, but not necessarily plausible. After all, at least since the Industrial Revolution in Western countries, we have seen a rather large increase in the amount of capital per laborer over time. Alternatively, Robert Solow (1957) offered an explanation of constancy in terms of technical progress: although the capital-labor ratio has indeed increased, the reason that the shares have stayed constant can be possibly explained that the capital-effective labor ratio has been constant (where by effective labor, we mean technically-augmented labor). As it is the marginal product of effective labor which determines the wage, then the constancy of distribution can be explained by a constant capital-effective labor ratio. A more fruitful explanation was proposed by Martin Bronfenbrenner (1960): namely, instead of speculating whether capital-labor ratios are constant or not, why not examine the conditions under which relative income shares might be constant when the capital-labor ratio does change. Bronfenbrenner identified the keystone to be the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. To see this, consider our canonical production function again, Y = ¦ (K, L). In order to obtain the marginal productivity theory of distribution, we will have to assume it is constant returns to scale. Consequently, we can express it in intensive form as: y = f (k) where y = Y/L and k = K/L. The intensive production function is depicted in Figure 4.   Figure 4 - Intensive Production Function So what exactly are the income shares of capital and labor in Figure 4? At a given capital-labor ratio, the slope of the intensive production function is the marginal productivity of capital, i.e. f k = ¦ K. We also know that the marginal product of labor is thus the remainder, ¦ L = y - f kk (see our earlier discussion). Consider now the following procedure (originally due to Knut Wicksell (1893) and Joan Robinson (1956)). At a given capital-labor ratio, k*, the tangent line will have slope ¦ K, which is the marginal product of capital. Now, this tangent line crosses the vertical axis at point w in Figure 4. We claim now three things: (1) w is the real wage; (2) the portion on the vertical axis 0w are payments to labor per capita (w = ¦ LL/L = ¦ L); (3) the remaining portion on the vertical axis wy* are payments to capital per capita (wy* = ¦ KK/L). To see this, note that the following relationships hold in the diagram: ¦ K = f k = y*/sk* = w/s0 = wy*/k* Consequently, ¦ KK/L = ¦ Kk* = wy*, i.e. per capita capital income is precisely the portion wy* on the vertical axis in Figure 4. As per capita labor income is y* - ¦ Kk, then consequently the rest of the vertical axis (portion 0w) is per capita labor income, ¦ L, thus w represents the real wage. Relative shares, ¦ KK/Y and ¦ LL/Y are obtained by dividing the per capita shares by the output-labor ratio, y*. Specifically, ¦ L/y = ¦ LL/Y and ¦ Kk/y = ¦ KK/Y. Thus, the relative income shares are obtained by calculating the relative sizes of the portions w and wy* on the vertical axis in Figure 4. What happens then when the capital-labor ratio changes? If k increases, y increases and so will w, the intercept of the tangent line on the vertical axis. But whether and how the relative shares of capital and labor change can be read diagramatically: if w rises more than y* rises, then the relative share of labor has risen relative to the share of capital. As Martin Bronfenbrenner (1960) has shown, the evolution of relative income shares depends in good part on the elasticity of substitution s . To see this formally, note that this question reduces to finding out whether ¦ KK/Y is positive or negative. This can be rewritten as ¦ Kk/y, thus differentiating with respect to k: ¶ (¦ Kk/y)/k = (y¦ KKk + y¦ K - ¦ K2k)/y2 As y2 ³ 0 and y¦ KKk < 0, then in order to prove that the relative income share of capital rises with k, we must prove that: y¦ K - ¦ K2k > -[y¦ KKk] or simply: -¦ K(y-¦ Kk)/y¦ KKk > 1 We write this in this manner because consultation with an earlier section ought to reveal that this is exactly the expression for the elasticity of substitution, s, in the constant returns to scale case in intensive form. Thus, for ¦ KK/Y to rise (fall) with k, then it must be that s > 1 (s < 1). To see this intuitively, recall that s is defined as: s = ¶ ln (L/K)/¶ ln (¦ K/¦ L) We can see how s captures the essence of this problem by trying to plot how relative income shares, ¦ KK/¦ LL change in response to a rise in the capital-labor ratio, k = K/L.  A little bit of math will show that:         1/s - 1 = -¶ ln (¦KK/¦LL)/¶ ln (K/L) Various possible cases are depicted in Figure 5. Suppose s = 1, then the elasticity of substitution claims that ¦ K/¦ L and L/K rise proportionally, or, in other words, ¦ K/¦ L falls in exactly the proportion that K/L rises, thus ¦ KK/¦ LL is constant as K/L changes. This is shown by the horizontal line s = 1 in Figure 5. Suppose now that s > 1, then ¦ K/¦ L falls less than the amount K/L rises, thus ¦ KK/¦ LL rises when K/L rises. This is captured by the upward slope of the curve s > 1 in Figure 5. Finally, if s < 1, then ¦ K/¦ L falls more than the amount K/L rises, thus ¦ KK/¦ LL falls as K/L rises - thus the downward slope of the s < 1 curve in Figure 5. Fig. 5 - Relative Income Shares and Elasticities of Substitution The three curves s < 1, s = 1 and s > 1 depicted in Figure 5 assume that we have a constant elasticity of substitution production function, thus s is the same value throughout for any K/L. More generally, however, it is common to assume a relationship with varying elasticity of substitution, depicted by the hill-shaped locus s * in Figure 5: up to the capital-labor ratio k*, we have s > 1, at k*, s = 1 and after k*, s < 1. In this case, the relative shares of capital and labor vary differently with K/L depending on whether we are below or above the critical value k*. Thus, Bronfenbrenner's answer to Kaldor's ""stylized fact"" on constant relative income shares is that the elasticity of substitution tends not to stray from s = 1, thus relative income shares have remained constant. A second interesting hypothesis was laid out by David Ricardo (1817: Ch. 31), in his famous chapter ""On Machinery"" added to the third (1821) edition of the Principles. In effect, Ricardo had argued that the introduction of machinery would have an adverse effect on labor income. In our terms, the question is what is the impact of a rise in K on the absolute shares - and not relative shares - of income, i.e. the impact of K on rK and wL. (the issue of the impact of specific types of technical progress on relative income shares is discussed elsewhere). We shall concentrate mainly on the impact of a rise in K on rK. The specific question can be posed this way: does the amount of income going to capital increase if more capital is employed? The question can thus be written: when do we have it that ¶ (¦ KK)/¶ K > 0? Note that this is not self-evident: K increasing increases the numerator, but, as we know, substitution implies that ¦ K would fall, thus ¦ KK may rise or fall accordingly. By definition note that: ¶ (¦ KK)/¶ K = ¦ K + K¦ KK thus if this is to be positive, then it must be that: -¦ KK·(K/¦ K) < 1 as we are assuming that ¦ K > 0 and ¦ KK < 0. But notice that this is the inverse of the elasticity of the marginal product (i.e. capital demand) curve, i.e. -¦ KK·(K/¦ K) = e -1 where e = -(¶ K/¶ ¦ K)·(¦ K/K). Thus, if the demand for capital is elastic (i.e. e > 1), then the absolute income going to capital will rise with K; if demand for capital is inelastic (i.e. e < 1), then the absolute income going to capital will fall with K. This result, of course, is quite intuitive: elastic and thus relatively flat demand curve for capital means that a rise in K will reduce ¦ K very slightly, thus the income going to capital is bound to increase quite a bit; in contrast, an inelastic (and thus quite steep) demand curve for capital means that even a small rise in K will reduce ¦ K by a lot, thus capital income ¦ KK is bound to fall. It is easy to show that we can reduce this to a statement in terms of the elasticity of substitution. Recall that as ¦ (·) is homogeneous of degree one, then marginal products ¦ K(·) are homogeneous of degree zero, i.e. ¦ KKK + ¦ KLL = 0. Thus, ¦ KKK = -L¦ KL, so substituting into our earlier expression, we have: L¦ KL/¦ K < 1 as the necessary condition for a rise in K to increase ¦ KK. Now it is common to assume (and this is not implied) that ¦ KL > 0, thus we can rewrite this condition as: ¦ K/¦ KL > L or, multiplying by ¦ L/Y: ¦ L¦ K/¦ KLY > ¦ LL/Y But again, by our earlier section we should recognize the term on the left as alternative form of the elasticity of substitution, s , for the constant returns to scale case. Thus, in order for a rise in K to increase ¦ KK we need: s > ¦ LL/Y i.e. the elasticity of substitution must be greater than the relative share of labor. Now, ¦ LL/Y < 1, so this is not enough to tell us much. But one thing should be recognized: it is entirely possible that ¦ LL/Y < s < 1. This means that it is possible that, when capital increases, that we simultaneously have it that the relative share of capital falls (as s < 1) while the absolute share of capital rises (¦ LL/Y < s ). Now we turn to the Ricardo question: does the amount of labor income rise or fall when machinery (K) is increased? This is read directly: ¶ ¦ LL/¶ K = ¦ KLL. If ¦ KL > 0, as has been assumed so far, then the absolute share of labor rises. Note the peculiarity in this result: whether labor income rises or falls when capital increases does not depend at all on what happens to the absolute share of capital, nor indeed on labor's own relative share. The amount of income received by a factor always rises when the quantity of the other factor increases. However, we must remind ourselves that this is rests on the ¦ KL > 0 assumption and is not implied by CRS or anything else. More details on the Neoclassical theory of distribution are found in our discussion of capital theory. Selected References A.

The Socialist Calculation Debate,"The Socialist Calculation Debate   _________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________   The ""Socialist Calculation"" debate emerged at the end of the 19th Century. With the crushing poverty of the industrial revolution as evidence, Socialists, Marxians and other critics of laissez-faire argued that free markets had, in effect, failed and that a benevolent government with control over the means of production and distribution, could allocate goods in a more efficient and equitable manner. The ""Socialist Calculation"" debate took off when proponents of laissez-faire argued that markets could allocate resources ""better"" or at least ""no worse"" than an even infinitely wise government could. Although the debate had been effectively on during the emergence of the Marxian School, the formal ""Socialist Calculation"" debate was first seriously discussed by the Lausanne economist Enrico Barone in a 1908 article on ""Ministry of Production in a Collectivist State"" which followed up on Pareto's (1896; 1906: p.266-9) own speculations. Barone made the argument that, at least in principle, a socialist economy could do as well as a capitalist one as prices should be seen merely as the solution to a set of equations in a Walrasian system - whether these were solved by the government or the market was irrelevant.  But might a socialist system actually do better? The question was posed by Otto Neurath. Neurath observed that during World War I, European governments ran a ""war economy"" that maintained employment high, eliminated business fluctuations, etc. That, Neurath felt, was due to the fact that the government was not profit-seeking during the War and seemed to be an efficient organizer of resources and maximization of production for the war effort. Could not the same occur in peacetime? Neurath thought so - with the additional benefit of the elimination of money in such a system as ""real values"" would be sufficient if there was collective control. Other Marxian economists such as Otto Bauer and Emil Lederer, who were involved with the German socialization committee in the aftermath of that war were not as adamant as Neurath about the elimination of money, but they certainly thought that, particularly with the existence of industrial concentration, the socialist solution was more efficient. This question was also posed by Fred M. Taylor in his famous 1929 AER article and answered in the affirmative - yes, a socialist state could be at least ""as efficient"" as a private enterprise economy - with the benefit that in a collective system, initial income (or endowment) distribution would be an additional variable of control the government possessed which a market economy did not have at its disposal. What about consumption? Maurice H. Dobb (1933) went further and argued that consumer sovereignty was itself overrated: if government controlled consumption as well as production decisions, there would be no issue of ""inefficiency"". The Austrians entered the fray under with a cannonade by Ludwig von Mises. In a famous 1920 article ""Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth"", Mises went on the attack - arguing that pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if government owned the means of production, then no prices could be obtained for capital goods as they were merely internal transfers of goods in a Socialist system and not ""objects of exchange"" (unlike final goods) - thus they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily inefficient. But Mises's argument was erroneously construed - as H.D. Dickinson (1933) was quick to point out. After all, as Barone and Taylor had shown, if we see the world as a system of Walrasian equations which need ""solutions"", there is no issue about not being able to price internal products. The ball was back in the Austrian court, and it was up to Friedrich von Hayek (1935) to construct an argument. The system of equations Barone and Taylor envisioned, Hayek argued, required too much information that would certainly not be easily available and the ensuing calculations (for ""thousands of equations"") would be too difficult. Similarly, the economic incentives provided in a market economy could not be reproduced in a collective system. The Paretian economists, notably Taylor (1928), Jacob Marschak (1923), Oskar Lange (1936, 1938) and Abba Lerner (1934) argued that a state-run economy could at least be as efficient - provided government planners used the price system as if in a market economy.  This, of course, was merely an application of the Paretian welfare theorems.  Furthermore, in practical terms, a market economy can easily encounter market failures (e.g. from imperfect competition, externalities or transaction costs) that prevent the price mechanism from achieving an efficient allocation; a government which set prices as if in a fully-competitive system could overcome this and would thus be more efficient. Oskar Lange's argument was particularly compelling.  Prices, he argued, are merely rates of exchange of one good for another (or, as Pareto (1906: p.155) would argue, they are an ""accounting device in connection with the distribution of goods and their transformation""). Even if we see them as parameters for decision-makers, then whether they are provided by a central planner or by a market is irrelevant as long as managers of state enterprises are given instructions to act as cost-minimizers. Lange's solution to the issue of ""finding"" correct prices and the stability of the market was remarkable: let the government act as the mythical Walrasian ""auctioneer"" - searching for prices via tatonnement. Furthermore, on the issue of socialist economies' lack of incentives, Lange reiterated that in a modern capitalist economy, with the growing division between ownership (stockholders) and managers (CEOs, etc.), the incentives were just as twisted (Lange appealed to the work of various Institutionalists for this). Friedrich Hayek refined his position in response to this new argument. He did this in a series of seminal articles (1937, 1940, 1945, 1948, 1968) where he essentially argued that a state-run economy could not achieve greater efficiency in resource allocation than a capitalist one largely because the information conveyed by the price-mechanism of a market economy was greater than the information any planner could possibly acquire. This led on to the work on information and self-organization that dominated the second half of Hayek's career. Among the more interesting results of this debate was the adoption, in the Soviet Union itself, of the techniques suggested by Lange. This led to the development of linear programming by Leonid Kantorovich which demonstrated that efficient allocation in a planned economy required effectively the same of use of prices as in a competitive market economy. This was also discovered by Tjalling C. Koopmans in his formal discussion of efficiency in a multi-market scenario. In their conclusion, that a collectivist economy could do no better than a private market system in the idealized Walrasian world - but it might also do no worse. In short, they confirmed Barone's original conjecture - at least in theory. The Austrians have held on to Hayek's position on the ""informational"" role of prices and the incentives problem. _________________________________________________________________ Selected References E.

The Bullionist Controversy," The Bullionist Controversy emerged in the early 1800s regarding whether or not paper notes should be made convertible to gold on demand. This metamorphosized later in the 1840s into the Banking-Currency School debate over the gold parity of the Bank of England notes. Background In 1694, at the instigation William Paterson and the assent of the new Dutch king of England, William III, a new joint-stock company, the Bank of England, was formed to help finance the government's borrowing.  In 1695, the Bank of Scotland was incorporated.  In 1696, a proposal by John Briscoe and Hugh Chamberlain for a ""National Land Bank"", an equivalent note-issuing bank for the English provinces, with credit secured by land rather than gold, failed to get off the ground. Besides lending to the government, the Bank of England's principal line of business was the London discount market - that is discounting commercial bills of exchange. The English currency crisis of 1695-98 lowered confidence in Bank of England notes. To shore up confidence, in 1704, government passed laws making promissory notes legally enforceable.  This did not prevent a crisis and run on the Bank in 1707.  So in 1708, parliament passed an act (7 Anne, c.7) prohibiting private companies with more than six partners from issuing promissory notes anywhere in England.  In 1720, in the course of the South Sea Bubble, the Bubble Act (6 Geo. 1, c. 18) prohibited the formation of joint-stock companies without a royal charter.  The banking act was clarified and reinforced in 1742 (15 Geo. 2, c.15).  England was consequently reduced to a single, note-issuing joint-stock bank (Bank of England) and a myriad of small, private partnership banks which did not issue notes in London.  Outside of London, there was a plethora of country banks which issued notes.. The Bullionist Debate of the 1810s In early 1797, rumors that French soldiers had landed on English soil led to a widespread bank run in Britain. Customers hurried to their banks demanding immediate redemption of their notes in gold bullion.  Several country banks failed, and on Saturday, February 25, 1797, the Bank of England reported its gold reserves were reduced to 1.1 million, and that it was likely to face a bank run when it opened on Monday.   The Pitt government issued an order in council the next day suspending the convertibility of bank-notes to cash until Parliament could address the issue.  After deliberation, Parliament, in early May, 1797, it passed the Bank Restriction Act (37 Geo III, c.45), extending Pitt's restriction until six months after the finalization of a stable peace treaty with France.. The crisis, then, was properly averted, but some commentators believed the government should have restored convertibility immediately after the invasion panic subsided. An intellectual debate proceeded immediately as lawyers, bankers and statesmen lined up for and against the maintenance of convertibility of notes into gold.  On the one hand, there were the ""Bullionist"" group, which argued for convertibility; arrayed on the other side were the ""Anti-Bullionist"" who preferred the status quo of suspension. The Bullionist argument was straightforward. If banks are not required to convert notes into gold, then they will be tempted to issue notes in excess of the gold in their vaults. This will lead to an excess supply of money and hence, by their view, a cheapening of the price of money, i.e. inflation. They argued that to avoid inflation, required convertibility of notes into gold should be restored. Among the prominent spokesmen for the Bullionists were John Wheatley, David Ricardo, Sir Henry Parnell and Francis Horner. In contrast, the Anti-Bullionists appealed to some form of the old Real Bills Doctrine of John Law (1705), Sir James Steuart (1767) and Adam Smith (1776). Given the peculiar, long experience of Scottish banking with inconvertibility, this authorship is not surprising. Banknotes, Smith had argued, were issued by banks in exchange for merchants' bills of exchange. As long as the repayment of these bills of exchange is credible (i.e. ""Real Bills"" as opposed to ""Fictitious Bills""), then no more banknotes will be issued than what is required by merchants. In short, the demand for banknotes by commerce is itself limited by the ""needs of trade"", hence even without convertibility, the bank is not going to issue more notes than what commerce demands. Thus, there will never be excess note issue. If there happens to be excess issue by accident, however, this still would not cause inflation as it would return immediately to the banks upon the liquidation of the bills of exchange.   This was called the ""reflux principle"" and was part of the Real Bills Doctrine. Among the Anti-Bullionists who espoused this doctrine in the early 1800s, we find Henry Boase, Nicholas Vanisttart, Charles Bosanquet, Robert Torrens and James Mill (although Mill subsequently converted to the Bullionist camp after his interaction with Ricardo). Henry Thornton (1802) occupies a curious intermediary position. Although dismissing the Bullionist case for resumption at this stage, citing lack of evidence that excess issue caused the inflation, he also provided an admirable critique of the Real Bills doctrine. Namely, he asked, who guaranteed that the demands of commerce were limited? Suppose actual capital yields returns higher than the rate of interest (or discount) charged by the banks? Would not merchants' demand an interminable amount of notes - however ""real""? Bills offered for exchange into notes, he argued, might not readily be ""limited"" as the Real Bills advocates argued. Inflation must thus ensue. Thornton's analysis formed the germ for the later ""cumulative process"" of Knut Wicksell (1898).  The Bullionist debate reached its climax in 1810, with the establishment of the ""Bullion Committee"" by parliament, chaired by Francis Horner, and including Parnell and Thornton, to inquire into Ricardo's allegations about excess issue.  The Bullion Committee's report concluded that excess issue was indeed to blame for a recent bout of inflation, and recommended immediate resumption to convertibility (Thornton agreed with the report, with qualifications).   However, the report came out too late in the parliamentary session to be considered, and would have to wait a year.  In the interim, a veritable battle took place in the pages of the English press, attacking and defending the report.  In the Spring of 1811, when the report was finally brought up for debate and vote on the parliamentary floor, the act of resumption was resoundingly defeated.  Attention soon drifted, as the new problem facing Britain after 1812 was deflation rather than inflation, and economic debates focused on the Corn Laws. The issue of resumption returned  for a second round in 1818, with the establishment of new committee headed by the young Sir Robert Peel.  It also recommended resumption, and this time it passed parliament in 1819.  Convertibility of paper notes to gold was resumed by 1821. The Banking Debates of 1830s-40s  The financial crisis of 1825-26 and the attendant wave of private bank failures had put monetary reform back on the table - this time focused on the banks.  This had been agitated for by Thomas Joplin since 1822.  Clearly a banking system reliant on a single gigantic Bank of England and a multitude of small, vulnerable, weakly-capitalized, private banks, was dangerous for the health of the financial and payments system so critical to Britain's commerce and prosperity.  In an effort to strengthen the banking sector, the Bank Act of 1826 authorized the establishment of note-issuing joint-stock banks outside a radius of 65 miles from London.  Under the new law, banking companies could have an unrestricted number of partners (previously it had been limited to six) but would not enjoy limited liability.  To compensate for the loss of its privileges (and its profitable rediscount business), the Bank of England was allowed to open branches in the provinces. But Joplin felt that was not enough, and noted that the current banking law did not forbid joint-stock banks to operate inside of London, provided they only took deposits and did not issue notes. The issue was take up in 1833, when the Bank of England's charter was up for renewal.  Much to the Bank's protest, the government inserted an explicit declaratory clause concurring with Joplin, noting it was perfectly legal for deposit-taking joint-stock banks to establish themselves inside of London (3 & 4 William IV, c.98)   It also inserted two other important changes - one making Bank of England notes ""legal tender"" in redemption of country bank notes, another exempting banks from usury laws. Immediately, a series of joint-stock London banks were created - the London and Westminster (1834), the London Joint Stock (1836), the London and County (1839) and dozens more.  But the Bank of England (in collusion with the small private banks) took a stance of unrelenting hostility towards the upstarts, refused to let them open accounts, or use their clearing facilities. The fledgling joint-stock banks responded as best they could, making up for their crippled means by offering high interest rates to their depositors - which could only be paid for, naturally, by a more reckless lending policy.  Predictably, all this unleashed waves of speculation and spectacular failures,  culminating in the Panic of 1837.  In the aftermath, the pressure was on to tighten the system, a crusade launched by Samuel Loyd (Lord Overstone).  It became known as the Banking school-Currency school debates The eventual result was the Banking Acts of 1844, which came into two parts.  The first (7 & 8 Vict c.32, also known as ""Bank Charter Act"" or ""Peel's Act"") prohibited the creation of any new note-issuing banks and restricted those already in existence from expanding.  The Bank of England would henceforth have a de facto note-issuing monopoly. Moreover, the amount of issue would be strictly tied to gold reserves.  The second act (7 & 8 Vict .c.113, ""Joint Stock Banks Act"")  threw up so many restrictions and bureaucratic obstacles that made it practically impossible to create any new joint-stock banks.  And very few were - only three were created over the next decade.  These restrictions would be mildly relaxed in a series of acts 1857-62.  The debates leading up to the 1844 Banking Act pitted the ""Currency School"" (which supported the Act) against the ""Banking School"" (which preferred to retain the status quo), and resurrected some of the issues of the earlier Bullionist controversy.  The ""Currency School"", argued that there needed to be a maximum amount of note issue (which the gold standard provided) or else inflation would result.  They argued that the problems of the 1830s banking system resulted from the fact that the Bank of England's had conflicting objectives, that its note-issuing was tied to its private banking activities, and urged a strict separation between the two.  Note-issuing should be ""like currency"", and follow a 100% gold reserve requirement, completely independently of the bank's other activities (a proposal already made by Joplin back in 1823).  The Currency School after 1837 was led by Lord Overstone and counted among its proponents James R. McCulloch,  Mountiford. Longfield and Robert Torrens. Rallied against the act was the ""Banking School"", who argued that convertibility was enough, that imposing strict note-issuing restrictions and gold parity was unnecessary. Although not accepting the old Real Bills doctrine in its entirety, they resurrected some of its essentials, and argued there was little danger of excess.  The new reflux principle was even simpler: excess note issue might induce inflation, but that would lead to a race to redeem notes in gold, thereby removing the excess money supply.  As a more general point, and a little ahead of its time, the Banking School argued that note restrictions were pointless, since deposits and bills of exchange are effectively also money, and that concerns about inflation are better dealt with by focusing on the restriction of bank credit, rather than note-issue. The Banking School was led by Thomas Tooke, John Fullarton and the young John Stuart Mill. As it happened, several circumstances during this period led to the suspension of the Banking Act three times (1847, 1857, 1866), lending credibility to the position of the Banking School. Nonetheless, the Currency School won the day and gold parity to note issue introduced in 1844 was generally maintained until the First World War.

The General Glut Controversy,"The General Glut Controversy ________________________________________________________ Back  In 1803, Jean-Baptiste Say examined, in his book, the evolution of trade between Great Britain and Brazil. He realized that the only way for Brazil to buy British goods was to supply Brazilian goods to Britain in order to obtain the sterling necessary to demand English goods. Say extended this to a single economy in claiming that a demand for a particular set of goods can only be expressed by an equivalent supply of another set. An easier example can make this clearer: how does a shoemaker get hats? He can either make them himself (which he really has no skill or knowledge to do at low cost) or he can simply make more shoes and exchange them for hats. Supply, therefore, ""creates"" demand. Almost all of Classical and most Neoclassical theory, is based, to a lesser or greater degree, on this simple, even tautological, assertion. In a simple shoe-hat world, at any one time, three possible situations may arise: (1) there may be a sufficient amount of shoes and hats to satisfy all demand; (2) there may be too many shoes offered on the market - implying too great a demand for hats; and (3) there may be too many hats and not enough shoes. Situations (2) and (3) are situations when markets have not made precise the allocations. However, the essence of Say's Law is that there can never be too much of both shoes and hats. A shoemaker would not make more shoes if he did not desire more hats. Therefore, Say's Law concludes, general gluts cannot exist. Now, the Classical economists were not so blind that they did not see great amounts of unemployment, or that they thought markets always worked. But they concluded that these were due to excess supplies and demands of particular commodities and not excess supplies (or gluts) of commodities as a whole. As Ricardo notes, ""Mistakes can be made, and commodities not suited to demand may be produced - of these there may be a glut"" (Ricardo, 1820: 160) and that ""it is at all times the bad adaptations of the commodities produced to the wants of mankind which is the specific evil, and not the abundance of commodities. Demand is only limited by the will and power to purchase."" (Ricardo, 1820: 161). John Stuart Mill concurs by noting that in these situations, ""production is not excessive, but merely ill-assorted"" (Mill, 1848: 380). Ricardo (1817: Ch.21) and Mill (1848: Ch.14) extended this proposition to savings and investment. If one produces more than one consumes, then the surplus is saved and, by definition of terms, invested. No one would produce in excess of consumption needs if one does not have a desire to either exchange it or invest it. Supply, therefore, is demand. This virtually all the Classical economists held to be an irrefutable truth. All but, of course, Thomas Malthus (1820, 1827) and also the French economist, J.C.L.Simonde de Sismondi (1819). Malthus and de Sismondi believed general gluts could exist and they gave their reasoning as follows. Income is distributed between workers, entrepreneurs and land-owners receiving wage income, profit and land rents. Let us assume the Classical proposition that all wages are consumed and all profits invested but make no stipulation as to what happens to the rents of land-owners. Presumably, landowners will receive a portion of income, but they may choose to consume it or not to consume it. Let us assume a Ricardian ""corn"" world, i.e. where only corn is produced and everyone is paid in corn and the only capital is corn (it goes into its own production as seed). Thus: Y = wL + (1+r)M + tT where w is the wage, L labor employed, r is the profit rate, M is capital employed, t the land rent and T the land employed. Thus, wL is the share of output which goes to workers, (1+r)M is the share of output which goes to capitalists and tT the share of output going to the landowner. Let us then define net output, X = Y - M, i.e. total output of corn minus the corn needed as capital implement. Thus, net output can be regarded as that output that is brought to ""market"", i.e. supplied. Then: X = wL + rM + tT so that we obtain wL as the proportion of net output going to labor, rM the proportion going to capitalists and tT the proportion going to landowners. Let us now assume that tT = 0, i.e. no landowners exist or, if they do, they receive no rent. Then total net output is distributed so: X = wL + rM However, since entrepreneurs do not consume, then aggregate demand is composed entirely of workers' demand. Now, as long as profits are positive, then workers' income is less than net output, i.e. wL However, this argument is unreasonable in several respects. First and foremost, as long as profit is positive, the demand for consumer goods is always, by definition, less than net output. Besides, we have entirely ignored what savings, the income of capitalists resolves into. If rM is invested, then that investment is essentially a demand for capital goods. Therefore, we must really write the equations for both consumer and capital goods sectors (multiplied by their respective prices since we are no longer in a one-good world): pcXc = wLc + rpkMc pkXk = wLk + rpkMk such that we have net output for consumer (Xc) and capital (Xk) goods respectively. The other terms follow logically (Lc and Lk are the labor employed by the consumer and capital goods industries respectively, Mc and Mk the capital employed and pc and pk are the prices for consumer and capital goods). To reduce the plethora of subscripts, we can normalize for pc, the price of the consumer good, so that pc = 1, so p = pk/pc is the price of the capital good in terms of the consumer good. Thus we get: Xc = wLc + rpMc pXk = wLk + rpMk Now, rp(Mc + Mk) constitutes the total income by capitalists in the consumer goods and capital goods sectors; assuming capitalists save all their income, then it is also equal to total saving and, by extension, total investment demand. pXk, of course, is the supply of capital goods. Thus, for investment demand (savings) to be equal to the supply of capital goods, then: rp(Mc + Mk) = pXk or simply, savings is equal to investment. Rewritten: rp(Mc + Mk) = wLk + rpMk so:     rpMc = wLk  substituting into the consumer goods equation: Xc = wLc + wLk  = w(Lc + Lk) i.e. total demand for consumer goods, which is derived from wage income in both sectors w(Lc + Lk) , will equal total supply of consumer goods, Xc. Thus, there is no general glut. This conforms to the simplest form of Say's Law, as stated by Ricardo (1817) and Mill (1848). How might throwing landowners into the picture affect this? Well, rewriting: Xc = wLc + rpMc+ tTc pXk = wLk + rpMk + tTk Let us suppose, again, that rp(Mc + Mk) represents total investment demand. Then, the savings-investment identity requires that: rp(Mc + Mk) = wLk + rpMk + tTk or: rpMc = wLk + tTk so, plugging back in the consumer goods sector: Xc = wLc + wLk + tTc + tTk = w(Lc + Lk) + t(Tc + Tk) total worker income w(Lc + Lk), and landowner income t(Tc + Tk) will exhaust the output of consumer goods. This is where Thomas Malthus's (1820, 1827) argument attempts to part way. What he argued is that if a part of landowners' total income t(Tc + Tk) is not consumed, then total consumption will not be enough to fulfill the total supply of consumer goods. In other words, if only a portion q of landowner income is consumed, so that  qt(Tc + Tk)  is total landowner consumption then:      Xc > w(Lc + Lk) + qt(Tc + Tk) In other words, there will be a general glut (excess supply of consumer goods) even though the investment-savings identity still holds. This may seem  reasonable until we ask whither the unconsumed portions of rent income? Presumably saved - and hence, invested (Malthus did not challenge the S = I identity). If q of rent income goes for the consumption, then (1-q) of it is saved. Conseqently, landlord savings must be (1-q)t(Tc + Tk) and total economy-saving becomes rp(Mc + Mk) + (1-q)t(Tc + Tk) and the savings-investment identity is: rp(Mc + Mk) + (1-q)t(Tc + Tk) = wLk + rpMk + tTk implying that: rpMc = wLk  + tTk  - (1-q)t(Tc + Tk) Plugging this back into the consumer goods equation: Xc = wLc + wLk  + tTk  - (1-q)t(Tc + Tk) + tTc or: Xc = w(Lc + Lk)  + qt(Tc + Tk) since qt(Tc + Tk) is defined as landlord consumption, then this condition states that total consumption demand will be equal to total supply of consumer goods. Thus, S = I and there is no excess supply of goods. There is no general glut, Say's Law is reinstated. The Malthus-Sismondi arguments, then, seem to fail to hold. However, things might change if we add a dynamic twist to this simplistic model. As Thomas Sowell (1972: p.32) notes, Ricardo erroneously transformed all of Malthus's and Sismondi's arguments, as we just have, into long-run comparative statics when they were, in fact, arguing in short-run dynamic terms. Malthus and Sismondi recognized that investment increases output capacity. Namely, investment in any period increases output capacity in that period which increases the supply of consumer goods by itself. Let us suppose, then, that Xc is consumer good output at period t and Xc + dXc is consumer good output a period ahead. Now, assuming a Robertsonian lag, so consumption at period t+1 is derived from t period's wage and rent income which are in turn derived from that period's output by the standard Ricardian equality Xc = w(Lc + Lk)   + qt(Tc + Tk).  However, this result obtains because we assumed that investment occurred at time period t. Therefore, capacity has increased and period t+1 output is Xc + dXc so that obviously: Xc + dXc > w(Lc + Lk)  + qt(Tc + Tk) the present supply of consumer goods exceeds the demand for consumption (which is derived from last period's income). This is the general glut Malthus was talking about. In this situation, unless consumption increases exogenously in period t+1 to meet the extra output, then either prices for consumer goods will fall or the glut will persist (since next period t+2 demand is based on t+1 income). If nothing else changes, then the glut persists. In this case, entrepreneurs will have little choice but to reduce investment. However, reducing investment demand at period t+1 will reduce labor incomes and rent incomes in the capital goods sector, so wLk   and tTk fall. However, this implies that total consumption will fall further so that, at time period t+2, the difference will be the same or even more pronounced. Consumption can lag persistently behind investment. Thus we get secular stagnation. One way out of this would be to increase consumption exogenously. Malthus argued for q to be jacked up at time t+1 so that landlords consume more. This would lower investment immediately since landlord savings would be depleted. This would, admittedly, lower worker consumption in the capital goods sector - but it would be replaced by higher landlord consumption. Thus, consumption could be brought up to meet output, mopping up dXc, while, at the same, the growth of capacity is reduced by lower savings. The conclusion Malthus' reached, then, is that as a policy, q should be increased concurrently to increases in output capacity so that the possibility of a glut be preempted. With landlords increasing their consumption autonomously as output increases, then everything will be reigned in. Hence Malthus's benevolence towards the landlord class. By pandering to landlords, he argued, they might just be induced to provide the extra consumption to avert secular stagnation. Ricardo (1820) translated this argument in long-run comparative statics terms - and showed, indeed, that the argument is incorrect as a long run argument. If the above inequality is true in the long run, then payments to factors in the consumer goods sector exceeds demand for consumer goods: wLc + rpMc + tTc  > w(Lc + Lk)   + qt(Tc + Tk) so: rpMc + tTc  > wLk  + qtTc + qtTk But since, by definition S = I, so  rpMc = wLk  + tTk   - (1-q)t(Tc + Tk), then this inequality must be rewritten: wLk  + tTk  - (1-q)t(Tc + Tk) + tTc > wLk  + qtTc + qtTk or simply: qt(Tc + Tk) > qt(Tc + Tk) which is a contradiction. Now, Malthus (1820: p.38) believed savings equals investment at all times, then was he wrong? Not really. After all, as we know, in the short run, the term on the left is determined at time t+1 whereas that on the right is determined at time t. Since output is higher at t+1 (from higher capacity) then this is perfectly sensible. But in the long run, the equality will have to emerge. The economic reasoning for this, as explained by Ricardo, Mill and others, was that any overproduction in the consumer goods sector necessarily implies that profits of entrepreneurs will have to fall (since they are not capable of selling). This will itself reduce saving and thus lead to a fall in investment - reducing capacity accordingly. Alternatively, the price of consumer goods would fall, therefore raising p (recall that p = pk/pc) so that pXk rises and so too does wage and rent incomes from payments in the capital goods sector. This will raise consumption accordingly. As we see, then, the Malthus-Sismondi story is only really applicable to short-run disequilibria. In the long run, it simply cannot be true. Now, to defend his position, Malthus might have well picked up one of Keynes's famous sayings about the short-run lasting a generation or that ""in the long run we are all dead"" - and Malthus did indeed come up with something similar: ""The question of a glut is exclusively whether it may be general, as well as particular, and not whether it may be permanent as well as temporary...[The] tendency, in the natural course of things, to cure a glut or scarcity, is no more a proof that such evils have never existed, than the tendency of the healing processes of nature to cure some disorders without assistace from man, is a proof that such disorders never existed."" (T.R. Malthus, 1827: p.62-3) Such indicates, then, that the protagonists were really speaking at cross purposes. Ricardo was concerned almost exclusively with long run possibilities of ""secular stagnation"" whereas Malthus seems to be more concerned with the mere possibility of general gluts existing in the short-run and, of course, that being a specific, practical problem that had to be dealt with. Note that this implies that Malthus succeeded in breaking what Becker and Baumol (1952) call ""Say's Identity"" (that there can be no general gluts at any time) albeit not ""Say's Equality"" (that in the long run there can be no general gluts). That this is true has been accepted by most economists. However, what has not been decided was whether Malthus's argument was really about short run frictions (as argued by Sowell (1972)) or rather that he was actually trying to prove, but failed to prove, the existence of long-run secular stagnation (as argued by Patinkin (1956) and Blaug (1962)). Nevertheless, Malthus (1820) had some clear policy propositions to cure the short-run problem. His most famous was that landlords' consumption be increased to ""fill"" the glut in demand. Since they do not produce anything, nothing is added to output but their very unproductiveness is actually welcome since it maintains demand for all goods while, at the same time, reduces investment. But should landlords hold back consumption, then we have a general glut. Malthus's identification of the landlord class as beneficial stands in stark contrast to Ricardo's (1817) view of them as parasitical. Karl Marx's(1910) critique of Malthus started from a position of agreement. Marx's idea of capitalist production, however, is characterized by his concentration on the division of labor and his notion that goods are produced for sale and not for consumption or exchange. In other words, goods are produced simply for the intention of transforming output into money to purchase other commodities. The possibility of a lack of effective demand, therefore, is held only in the possibility that there might be a time lag between the sale of a commodity (the acquisition of money) and the purchase of another (its disbursement). This possibility, also originally crafted by Sismondi (1819), endorsed the idea that the circularity of transactions was not always complete and immediate. If money is held, Marx contended, even if for a little while, there is a breakdown in the exchange process and a general glut can occur. Marx, like Malthus, also accepted the savings-investment identity but reached a different conclusion. Since investment is part of aggregate demand, circulation does continue in time even if money is held. The drive for accumulation, Marx concluded, will continue unhindered and thus a crisis of the sort Malthus described can never happen and if it did, would be practically inconsequential. What can happen, as Ricardo originally claimed, is that a single good may be oversupplied causing a very temporary and small adjustment of proportions which might seem as a general glut but in fact is not. Thus, all the Classical economists, except for poor Malthus and Sismondi, therefore were generally in agreement over the validity of Say's Law, at least in the long run. They all also agree on the identity of savings and investment as well as the separability of output and price theory.

(B) The Macromodel
(C) The Microfoundations
(D) Some Difficulties (A) The Fisherian Vision The ""Fisherian"" approach is so named because of the fundamental contributions of Irving Fisher (1907, 1911, 1930), but it might as well be called the ""Lausanne"" system as it exhibits the same properties and structure of the general equilibrium systems of Léon Walras and Vilfredo Pareto. We must not forget that, as Morishima (1977) reminds us, that perhaps uniquely among all pre-1920 economists, Walras (1874) did attempt to incorporate money, capital and growth into his story in a ""wholly Neoclassical"" manner. But Walras's efforts were tentative and subsequently ignored. What Fisher  did, particularly in his 1930   work, was to return to Walras's task in the context of a simplified general equilibrium model. Fisher treated ""macro"" as merely ""aggregated micro"", a jazzed-up ""G.E."" system (we must recall that when Frisch (1933) invented the term ""macroeconomics"", he was including the Walrasian economy-wide system of markets into his definition). Consequently, the Fisherian macromodel is a ""real"" system, i.e. money remains neutral, Say's Law is held to be true, thus there is no possibility of aggregate demand exceeding or falling below aggregate supply. Yet what was the purpose of building a ""macromodel"" if all it turns out to be is the old Walrasian G.E. model with all the trappings of being ""static"" and ""equilibrium""-based? How is this supposed to explain movements in output as a whole? Well, it will explain these in a very simple way: namely, it asserts that macrofluctuations must arise from elswhere. This may seem like a anti-climatic conclusion, but it is not ducking the issue completely. What the Fisherian approach asserts is that macrofluctuations will never arise from within a perfectly working system. If we see movements in macro variables like aggregate output, the price level, or interest rates, then one of the following must be the cause: (1) there is a real change, i.e. people's preferences, technology and/or endowments have changed, and all that we are observing is merely a change in equilibrium. The fluctuation is not a ""crisis"" at all, but actually an efficient response. (2) money has changed and price levels fluctuate, but the ""real"" economy has not changed at all. The fluctuation is only nominal or ""illusory"". This is not a ""crisis"", merely an inconvenience. (3) there has been a monetary change as in (2) but, because of sluggish or uncoordinated price adjustments, it has thrown all real prices into confusion and led to wrong signals and misallocations. This is a ""crisis"", but it is only temporary. (4) there has been a real change as in (1), but for some reason or another (e.g. labor unions, etc.), there are institutional rigidities that prevent real prices from adjusting to the new equilibrium. This is a serious ""crisis"" that may last for a long time unless (or until) the institutional rigidities are removed. The Fisherian macromodel will be discussed in more detail in this next section, but we already see its essential contours. There is a ""real"" economy, governed by ""real supply and demand"" which will determine the aggregate output level, the aggregate (full) employment level and the real (i.e. relative) prices of goods and factors. This is an equilibrium system which, bar any ""real"" changes in the primitives, remains comfortably stable. Changes in money will not change anything but the absolute price level.  Thus, the actual cause of fluctuations in output and employment must arise because of factors which are effectively outside of this system. They arise from money illusions, badly-placed expectations, miscoordination and institutional rigidities, etc. that come into play during what would otherwise be a smooth and natural adjustment process, whether this adjustment is in response to nominal changes (as in (3)) or real changes (as in (4)). The economy will not ""generate"" these fluctuations by itself. Naturally, the Fisherian model is not wholly or only Irving Fisher's. The contributions of Gustav Cassel (1918), Alfred Marshall (1923), Arthur Pigou (1927, 1933), Ralph G. Hawtrey (1913, 1926), Dennis Robertson (1926) and John Maynard Keynes (1923, 1930), are all really in this Fisherian tradition. They all looked for their explanations for fluctuations in real output in exogenous frictions, rigidities and imperfections in real variables or else confined their explanations of the cycle to fluctuations in the absolute price level. What we (and almost everybody else) calls the Neoclassical macromodel refers inevitably to the Fisherian version of it. It may not seem like a very interesting story, but by staying close to general equilibrium theory, its Neoclassical credentials cannot be doubted. The question is whether this is too high a price to pay. Cannot one create a thoroughly Neoclassical macromodel which says a little bit more about fluctuations than that?  One famous but ill-fated attempt to do so was that of Friedrich A. von Hayek (1929, 1931), which we treat elsewhere. (B) The Macromodel The (Fisherian) Neoclassical model of the macroeconomy has what may be regarded as a ""supply-determined"" equilibrium. Indeed, the first step of Neoclassical theory is to recognize that there are scarce factors that need to be efficiently allocated to satisfy as many wants as possible. Thus, the crux of Neoclassical theory is to take a given endowment of factors and, by a process of successive substitution, determine the most efficient allocation possible. The operator is the price system - or, in a single market, using price-sensitive demand and supply functions to determine the equilibrium price that will clear it. To understand the major relationships, let us the following ""catena"" or quick summary of the essence of the Neoclassical macromodel: (1) Factor supplies and factor demands determine factor returns and factor employment. (2) Factor employment and technological possibilities determine aggregate supply. (3) Aggregate supply and aggregate demand determine the equilibrium rate of interest. (4) Money demand and money supply determine the price level.  The essential features of the Neoclassical macromodel are shown diagramatically in Figure 1, with causality running from Quadrant I (upper right) to Quadrant III (bottom left).   Figure 1 - The Neoclassical Macromodel In order to work through this diagram, let us then begin with the first line of the catena, the factor markets. Let w/p be the real wage (where w is nominal wage and p is the price level). Let N be labor. Then we are allowed to write out the labor demand function as: Nd = Nd(w/p) where dNd/d(w/p) < 0 so that labor demand is a negative function of the real wage. This relationship arises from the substitution by profit-maximizing firms between labor and other factors. At high real wages, firms will opt for less labor-intensive techniques and at low wages, they will opt for more labor-intensive techniques. So, if labor is relatively more expensive, the demand for labor declines and thus, the labor demand curve is downward sloping, as shown in Quadrant I of Figure 1. Let us now turn to labor supply. Here we have: Ns = Ns(w/p) where dNd/d(w/p) > 0 so that labor supply is a positive function of the real wage. The upward-sloping labor supply function in Quadrant I of Figure 1 also arises from substitution - this time between work and leisure on the part of the household. The greater the real wage, the more labor is supplied. The equilibrium in the labor market and is given by: Nd(w/p) = Ns(w/p) which gives us the equilibrium real wage (w/p)* and the equilibrium level of employment (N*), a shown in Quadrant I of Figure 1. Given these conditions, then by total differentiation we know that: dw/w = dp/p i.e. nominal wages (w) are fully flexible and will accompany changes in the price level (p) by the same proportion in order to maintain (w/p)* and, by extension, N*. This flexibility need not be necessarily instantaneous - adjustment can take time - but it is certainly the ""long-run"" tendency. In sum, in the long run, employment does not change with a different price level since nominal wages will change proportionately. Thus, we have obtained the first line of the catena and the first quadrant of Figure 1. We have also, by extension, obtained the second one as well. Proposing a short-run production function Y = ¦ (N), then given N* from the labor-market clearing we just derived, we obtain, immediately, the level of aggregate supply, Y*. This is shown in Quadrant II of Figure 1. Now, turning to the goods market in Quadrant III of Figure 1, we notice that the aggregate supply curve is horizontal (or vertical, in normal perspective). In other words, aggregate supply, Y*, is derived entirely from factor-market clearing - thus the output of goods in an economy is wholly ""supply-determined"". The greater the level of employment, N*, the greater the level of output, Y*. Thus, the supply of goods enters the goods market already determined and is invariant to anything that happens within the goods market alone. Now we turn to the third line in the catena. The given output Y* will be factor income which is, in turn, consumed, saved or taxed away, thus: Y = C + S + T Aggregate demand, Yd, however, is composed of consumption, investment and government expenditures, thus: Yd = C + I + G Thus, for there to be an equilibrium in the goods market, for aggregate demand to be equal to aggregate supply of goods (Yd = Y), then it must be that C + I + G = C + S + T or, cancelling out C and flipping G over: I = S + (T - G) Thus the condition for equilibrium in the goods market is that investment be equal to savings -- where savings here is defined as private sector saving, S , and public sector saving, (the excess of government revenue over expenditures, or T-G). This is equivalent to the loanable funds theory which says that the supply of loanable funds (public plus private savings) be equal to the demand for loanable funds (investment) in equilibrium. What brings this equilibrium about? Movements in the rate of interest. The interest rate adjustes to bring Yd in equality with Y (or, equivalently, I into equality with S). This is in stark contrast to the Keynesian multiplier where it is output itself that adjusts to equate investment and savings. Thus, we shall argue that interest in the Neoclassical model does not affect aggregate supply, but rather affects only aggregate demand. Given that the rate of interest affects aggregate demand, how does it do so? The most straightforward channel is through investment. This is essentially the flow relationship proposed by Irving Fisher (1930) in his ""second approximation"". The reasoning for the negative relationship between investment and interest rate is given in more detail elsewhere. Thus, investment demand is negatively related to the rate of interest, I = I(r) where I(.) < 0. However, there is a second relationship between r and aggregate demand - namely through consumption and savings. Via  Fisher's (1930) ""first approximation"", we obtain the result that C = C(Y, r), i.e. consumption is a function of income and interest and that CY > 0 and Cr < 0, i.e. increases in income raise consumption whereas increases in interest reduce it. In other words, as interest rate rises, the desirability of saving is higher. Thus, in our general consumption function, C = C(Y, r), we have it that Cr < 0. Thus, we have the main relationships needed for aggregate demand, i.e. Yd = C(Y, r) + I(r) + G As noted, Cr < 0 and Ir < 0, thus the aggregate demand function is downward sloping with respect to interest. Aggregate supply is invariant with interest. Thus, the third line of the catena is fulfilled by recognizing that Yd = Y will be equated by movements in the rate of interest. All this is shown in Quadrant III of Figure 1. But everybody knows that the interest rate is determined in the market financial assets. How is this related? The adjustment mechanism of the goods market should be expanded upon as it relates to  Fisher's (1930) theory of loanable funds. This can be verified by considering the firm's investment decision and the household's consumption-savings decision simultaneously. ""Loanable funds"" are demanded by firms who need it for investment and loanable funds are supplied by households who need some place to put their savings. If a firm demands loanable funds, it will issue (i.e. supply) bonds; if a household supplies loanable funds, it will seek to buy (i.e. demand) bonds. Thus, I = Bs and S = Bd (note: Bd and Bs must be flow terms, thus they are not the demand and supply of the stock of bonds, but rather the demand and supply of new bonds). The relationship between the three markets is depicted intuitively in Figure 2. If interest clears the loanable funds (e.g. is at r* in Figure 2) market, Bd = Bs, then obviously it is equivalent to saying that I = S and therefore Yd = Y. If interest is too low (e.g. at r1 in Figure 2), so that there is excess demand for goods Yd > Ys or, equivalently, excess investment demand, I > S, which implies in turn that there must be excess bond supply, Bs > Bd. The reverse applies if interest rates are too high (e.g. at r2). Figure 2 - Interest Rates Applying standard market-clearing arguments for the loanable funds market, we can say that if r is too high (e.g. at r2), then the interest will have to fall to equilibriate the loanable funds market (Bd=Bs) and so, by extension, the goods market (Yd=Ys). Step-by-step, the fall in interest leads to an increase in investment demand and an decrease in savings via the effect on intertemporal allocation of consumption. These effects are equivalent, in Neoclassical theory, to a reduction in the demand for loanable funds and an increase in their supply. Note that in this simple model, the change in the rate of interest, r does not affect aggregate supply. We could posit that it does - by some argument that labor supply or labor demand varied with r. But that would complicate our story somewhat -- and our original equations for Nd and Ns do not have r as arguments. Thus, in this simplified model, aggregate demand does all the adjusting. Aggregate supply is ""predetermined"" in the factor markets. Finally, we should note that we have assumed that household savings are equivalent to the demand for loanable funds without considering that they may desire to place their savings in other assets (such as money or goods themselves). As Keynes (1936) demonstrated, when these other assets are taken into account, there will some quite important modifications to our conclusions. But where is money anyway? The Neoclassicals appended this on top of their existing construction. In the Cambridge cash-balance theory developed by Marshall (1923), Pigou (1917) and Keynes (1923), the interest rate and output will themselves feed into the money market by influencing the demand for real money (Md). i.e. Md = L(r, Y) where Lr < 0 and LY > 0 (the why of the first relationship is hard to reconcile with the loanable funds theory given earlier, but the Neoclassicals thought it logical, although Keynes, who developed this theory, saw it as the first approximation to his liquidity preference theory). If real money demand, Md, is determined by r and Y and r and Y are determined in the real markets for goods and factors, then if these are unchanged, then Ld will be unchanged. We are also given and (exogenous) real supply of money: Ms = M/p where M is the nominal money stock. For there to be money market equilibrium, Md = Ms, or: L(r, Y) = M/p However, as money demand is fixed externally and M is controlled by the central bank (an assumption), then all that remains to adjust this market into equilibrium is the general price level, p. The money market is illustrated in Figure 3, which is drawn in nominal terms, thus we have nominal money demand curve pMd = pL(r, Y) and nominal money supply schedule pMs = M where nominal money stock M* is given exogenously and thus only p* is left to be determined by equilibrium condition pL(r, Y) = M. Figure 3 - The Money Market Having determined the price level, p*, in the money market, do we need to go back and change anything we had before? No. The determination of money market has no impact on the determination of the real variables w/p, N, Y, r and B. Now, we could speculate that a change in the price level might affect real wages (w/p) - the only point p enters anywhere else in the system - but in fact, as we have seen, nominal wages (w) are assumed to be entirely flexible and so will adjust proportionately in the factor markets to maintain the market-clearing real wage (w/p)*, i.e. dw/w = dp/p. This implies that money is neutral, i.e. changes in the supply of money do not affect real variables. Notice that the real money demand function Md = L(r, Y) can be represented via two famous alternative ways. For instance, in the Cambridge cash-balance approach, we can posit the shape Md = kY (where the Cambridge constant, k, varies negatively with r). Alternatively, we can use Irving  Fisher's (1911) form and represent money demand function as Md = (1/V)Y (where velocity, V, varies positively with r). Thus, money market equilibrium condition in Figure 3, that Ms = Md or M/p = L(r, Y) can be rewritten as: M/p = kY which is the ""Cambridge equation"" or: M/p = (1/V)Y which is the Fisherian ""equation of exchange"". The money market equibrium depicted in Figure 3 is compatible with either of these. Because of the manner in which w/p is completely flexible and given the other relationships we have outlined here, there are three primary features of the Neoclassical model which are preserved here. Firstly, there is a strict dichotomy between the money market and the real market - what happens in the former does not affect the latter. Secondly, and by extension, money remains neutral, i.e. a rise in the supply of nominal money (M) will not affect any other variables other than the price level. A third, related characteristic is that we obtain the conclusion of the Quantity Theory of Money strictly: a change in the money supply will change price level proportionately but not anything else. The summary of the main points of this simplified version of the Neoclassical model are then the following. (1) factor market equilibrium determine the real wage (w/p)* and the level of employment N*. There is no involuntary unemployment as Nd = Ns = N*. (2) Output level Y* is supply-determined, i.e. determined, via the production function Y = ¦ (N), from the level of employment determined in the factor markets, N*. (3) Goods markets are brought into equilibrium by interest rates, i.e. at the equilibrium interest rate r*, aggregate demand equals aggregate supply and investment equal saving and demand for loanable funds equals the supply of loanable funds. (4) The Quantity Theory of Money holds, i.e. money is neutral, so that changes in the supply of money only affect the absolute price level and do not affect any real variables. (C) The Microfoundations We ought to emphasize a fifth feature of this model, namely that the foundations of the model are firmly set in Neoclassical micro-theory: (1) output, factor employment and investment are derived from firms' profit-maximizing decision (2) labor supply, consumption and savings are derived from household utility-maximization and (3) market-clearing conditions are imposed on all markets. Let us assume there are H households and F firms. We will focus on the representative household (the ""hth"" household) and the representative firm (the ""fth"" firm), before aggregating. Looking at the micro-level derivation is useful as it forces us to be a little clearer about what is being assumed in the model. Let us turn to the firm's decision, as this brings out the first problem: namely, whither capital? The only factor we referred to in our model was labor. Yet, as we know from typical Neoclassical theory, there must be other factors around which the firm must handle. One of these is capital. Now, since most macroeconomics operates largely in the short period, we usually sweep capital under the rug. However, whatever result we get for equilibrium labor employment and wages, there must be some corresponding equilibrium level of capital and employment and rate of return on capital. However, if the rate of return on capital is equal to the rate of interest (a common assumption in equilibrium, otherwise Wicksellian demons are unleashed), then the rate of interest is determined as the dual in the first line of our earlier catena. Then how does it turn up again in the third line to be determined by aggregate demand and supply? Is the interest rate determined in the first line the same as the interest rate determined in the third line? This is not evident. However, having said that, we must remember that capital and investment are two different things (as emphasized by  Fisher (1906)): the first is a stock term, the second is a flow term. Reconciling these has been a perennial headache in economic theory. This difficulty can be disposed of by one of the following three means. The first is by invoking the principle of marginal adjustment costs to capital employment. This is alright, but runs up against a little problem. In particular, if a firm cannot reach its ""optimal"" amount of capital, then, conversely, it ought not to hire the ""optimal"" amount of labor corresponding to that capital level but rather a different amount that corresponds to the investment level. We are not guaranteed full employment in this case. The second resolution is to invoke labor supply growth, so that we can choose optimal capital-labor ratios, and all investment is merely what is necessary to accompany labor supply growth. In this case, investment flow is eliminated as a decision separate from the capital stock decision, and so the problem disappears. This may work better, but then this is an issue of growth theory, not ""macro"" theory in the strictest sense. The third, and simplest, resolution, is to just follow Irving  Fisher (1930) and assume all capital is circulating, i.e. there is no K. The firm's decision is solely based on I and N. Does this make sense? Indeed, it can, but then we lose the independence of aggregate supply from the rate of interest (i.e.the aggregate supply curve becomes ""upward sloping"", rather than vertical). Specifically, following Fisher (1930), let us propose that the representative firm faces a ""short-run"" production function of the form: Y = ¦ (N, I) where the output of the fth firm is some function of N, the labor inputs employed by that firm and investment inputs. It is assumed that the¦ N > 0 and ¦ NN < 0, i.e. the marginal product of labor is positive but diminishing. Similarly, it is assumed that ¦ I > 0 and ¦ II < 0, so that we have diminishing marginal product of investment. The profit-maximizing firm will attempt to increase the difference between total revenue (pY, the sale of output) and total costs (i.e. total factor payments, wL + (1+r)I where w is the nominal wage and r is the rate of interest). So, letting p denote the profits of the firm, then its problem is: max p = p¦ (N, I) - wN - (1+r)I This yields us a pair of first order conditions: p¦ N = w p¦ I = (1+r) Now, let us take each in turn. Consider the first one. The term on the left, p¦ N is merely the marginal value product of labor, so this says that the firm will hire labor until its marginal value product is equal to the nominal wage. There are two other ways of writing this. A simple one is to divide by p, so that: ¦ N = w/p so now the firm hires labor until the marginal productof labor is equal to the real wage, w/p. Alternatively, we can write it as: p = w/¦ N where the curious term on the right is the marginal cost of output, i.e. the cost of hiring labor in order to increase output by a unit. To see this clearly, recall that ¦ N = dY/dN, so we can write w/¦ N = dwN/dY, i.e. the marginal cost of output is the increase in the wage bill (assuming w is constant, so wdN = dwN) from a unit increase in output. Thus, the equality above merely says that a firm hires labor (and thus produces output) until the output price (or marginal revenue) is equal to marginal cost. Whatever way we look at it, we see that given (w/p), we can determine the amount of labor demanded by the firm (Nd) via the condition ¦ N = w/p, i.e. assuming this is invertible, we can write the labor demand function as: Nd = ¦ N-1(w/p) The fact that ¦ N > 0 and ¦ NN < 0 implies that d¦ N-1/d(w/p) = d Nd/d(w/p) < 0, i.e.that the firm's labor demand curve is downward-sloping. The aggregate or economy-wide-level labor demand function is obtained by aggregate firm-level labor demand functions. We must assume (it is not evident), that these are sufficiently well-behaved so that these properties are also true for the economy-wide labor demand function. Let us now turn to investment decision of the firm. We can define p¦ I - 1 in Fisher's language as the ""marginal rate of return over cost"", or in more Keynesian language, the ""marginal efficiency of investment"", so MEI = p¦ I - 1. Thus, first order condition p¦ I = 1 + r implies that the firm will employ I (i.e. ""invest"") until MEI = r, i.e. marginal efficiency of investment is equated with rate of interest. Notice that as ¦ II < 0, then as the rate of interest rises, then, to equate r and MEI, it must be that investment declines - thus the negative relationship between investment and interest rate, succinctly, I = I(r) where Ir = dI/dr < 0. Yet we have been a bit fast and loose with this, as is it makes its seem that the investment decision is independent of wages and the labor demand decision is independent of the interest rate. Formally speaking, this will not be the case in this model (and here we enter into more ""Hayekian"" ground). To see why, notice what our argument has said: if the wage rises, then demand for labor falls. But why? When wages rose, the profits of the firm declined. There are two possible responses a firm can have in order to restore profits: firstly, by the law the ""law of increasing costs"", it may have decided to cut output as a whole, and higher output as a whole implies less labor hired, thus the demand for labor declines; secondly, by the ""law of technical substitution"", a firm may not necessarily change output as a whole, but merely restore profits by changing production methods to a more capital-intensive technique, i.e. moving away from labor and towards investment -- what Hayek (1931) called a ""lengthening of the production process"". In general, both these effects will probably come into play in order to explain the decline in labor demand when wages rise (details on these effects are discussed in our survey of production theory). In either case, note, the demand for investment goods is affected, so we cannot say that a rise in wages ""only"" affects labor demand. It will also affect investment demand and thus both the aggregate demand and aggregate supply side of the economy. Similarly, a rise in the rate of interest rate may lead to a reduction in investment demand and a rise in labor demand, and thus employment. So interest rate also affects both the aggregate demand and aggregate supply of the economy. The simplistic macromodel we described earlier does not capture this -- and it is not certain that we are better off now. In principle, then, when we have a Fisherian investment-labor economy, the first order conditions for a maximum imply that at the optimum: ¦ N/¦ I = w/(1+r) the ratio of marginal products is equal to the ratio of real factor prices (w/(1+r)). The factor price ratio is shown in Figure 4 as the slope of the isocost line. Once (w/(1+r)) is given, the firm automatically knows the amount of labor and investment it will undertake (N* and I*) as the tangency of the highest isoquant and the isocost curve (there is a bit of indeterminacy here, however; see our discussion of the production decision; we would need to use a Paretian general equilibrium model to do this properly). Figure 4 - the Production Decision At any rate, the main lesson is that labor demand Nd is no longer merely a function of the wage, but also of the rate of interest, (1+r). Similarly, investment demand I is not only a function of interest but also a function of the wage rate. The main relationships remain, however: an increase in w/(1+r), which can be due either to a rise in w or a fall in (1+r), will usually lead to a decline in labor demand and/or a rise in investment demand (we qualify this with the term ""usually"", because there are output effects in this story which may change our conclusions; see our section on production). At any rate, this implies that we still obtain a downward-sloping demand function for labor (as a function of the real wage) and a downward sloping investment function (as a function of the rate of interest). It is just that now we cannot really isolate them from each other. Finally, we should note that the microfoundations of production in the Neoclassical macromodel would get even more complicated if we decided to allow for fixed capital, K, as well. It is for this reason that we are sticking with the Fisherian circulating capital assumption. Let us now turn to the household's utility maximization problem. There are three things we want to obtain here: labor supply, consumption demand and savings. For simplicity, we will do this in separate steps, but in principle, these decisions are all made together at once. The labor supply function is derived from an exercise in utility-maximization on the part of the household. The representative household is assumed to be a rational hedonist - it attempts to maximize what it can consume and minimize the amount of work it has to do. Thus, we can posit a utility function for the household, U = U(C, N), where UY > 0 and UN < 0. UY and UN are the marginal utilities of consuming more goods and supplying more labor, thus our assumption about signs means that consuming goods, C, is utility-increasing while supplying labor, N, is utility-decreasing. The assumption of diminishing marginal utility for nice things implies that the utility function posses the following second derivatives UYY < 0 and UNN > 0. An agent buys goods with income obtained from selling his labor on the factor market (a household can also have endowments of goods or other factors, but we shall ignore that here), thus it faces two parameters in its constraint: the prices of goods and factors (p, w) and the factor it is endowed with (the maximum labor supply). Thus, he faces a budget constraint pC £ wN. In order to recognize that there is a maximum amount of labor supply (call it T - a person cannot work more than twenty-four hours a day), we shall change this constraint by adding the value of maximum labor supply (wT) to both sides so the constraint can be rewritten: pC + w(T - N) £ wT so the agent sells his total labor supply, T, to buy goods, C and ""leisure"" (T-N). The budget constraint is depicted in consumption-leisure space in Figure 5 by the straight line that emanates from the consumer's endowment, which is at (0, T), with slope -w/p. The agent maximizes his utility subject to this constraint: max U = U(C, N) s.t. pC + w(T - N) £ wT So, setting up a Lagrangian, and solving for the first order conditions for a maximum: dL/dC = UC - l p = 0 dL/dN = UN + l w = 0 where l is the Langrangian multiplier. This solution can be rewritten: (-UN)/UC = w/p i.e. the household will choose between desirable consumption of goods and irksome supply of labor (or, equivalently, desirable leisure) until the ratio of marginal utilities of each is equal to the real wage. This is shown in Figure 5 at point E. Notice, that at the utility-maximizing position E, the household will choose to supply N* amount of labor (and thus consume (T-N)* amount of leisure) and enjoy C* amount of consumption. He achieves utility level U(C*, N*) which is higher than the utility level he would obtain if he was forced to stick to his endowment (U(0, T)). Figure 5 - Consumption-Leisure Choice What will raising the real wage, w/p, imply for the supply of labor, N? The substitution effect argues that the greater the real wage, the more costly leisure becomes relative to consumption foregone and thus the agent will supply more labor. The income effect argues that the greater the wage, the agent can buy the same goods with less work and thus the more appealing leisure becomes (thus the agents supplies less labor). Thus, it is ambiguous. Nonetheless, the common reconciliation is to assume a backward-bending labor supply curve so that at low wages, the substitution effect dominates and at high wages, the income effect dominates. For simplicity, we shall argue here that the substitution effect dominates everywhere so that labor supply increases with the real wage. Let us now turn to the consumption-savings decision,  Fisher's (1930) ""first approximation"". We wish to obtain the result that C = C(Y, r), i.e. consumption is a function of income and interest and that CY > 0 and Cr < 0 or, equivalently, as S = Y - C, then we want a function S = S(Y, r) where SY > 0 and Sr > 0, so savings is a positive function of interest. This relationship is derived via intertemporal optimization of consumption on the part of the household. A two-period illustration of the concept is straightforward. Suppose a household has a lifespan of two periods, receives income in two periods (Y1, Y2) and must make a decision on how much to consume in each period (C1, C2). We can thus posit that it obtains utility from consumption in the form U = U(C1, C2). Although we will not specify a particular functional form is given, we should note that we normally assume that there is positive time preference so that a particular amount of future consumption is worth less in terms of utility than that same consumption amount in the present. If we have perfectly working financial markets, then the household can lend some of its present income to increase future consumption or borrow from its future income to increase present consumption. In the first case, it can curtail present consumption C1 and save an amount S = Y1 - C1 in the first period and receive it back with interest in the second so that second-period income is augmented by (1+r)S, i.e. second period income is Y2 + (1+r)S. If it borrows from the future to the present, all we have to do is consider it ""negative"" S. Thus, the household faces the following constraints in each period: C1 + S £ Y1 C2 £ Y2 + (1+r)S so, solving both for savings and equating them, we can collapse this into one ""intertemporal"" constraint: C1 + C2/(1+r) £ Y1 + Y2/(1+r) which can be interpreted as saying that the present value of the stream of consumption cannot exceed the present value of the stream of income (where, by present value, we see that future consumption and income is discounted by the rate of interest). This is depicted in Figure 6 by the straight line emanating from the intertemporal endowment (Y1, Y2) with slope -(1+r). The household faces the following intertemporal optimization problem: max U(C1, C2) s.t. C1 + C2/(1+r) £ Y1 + Y2/(1+r) where, setting up a Lagrangian, we get the following first order conditions: dL/dC1 = U1 - m = 0 dL/dC1 = U2 - m /(1+r) = 0 where U1 and U2 are the marginal utilities of present and future consumption respectively. The solution implies: U1/U2 = 1+r i.e. the household will allocate consumption in both periods until the ratio of marginal utilities is equal to the interest rate (or, in other words, until the desirability of present consumption relative to the future is equal to the foregone interest). The extrapolation of Fisher's two-period story to more than two periods is accomplished in the ""Life Cycle Hypothesis"" (LCH) of Modigliani and Brumberg (1954). Figure 6 illustrates the intertemporal optimization problem. Notice that C* is the chosen intertemporal allocation and Y is intertemporal endowment - thus this individual is a net saver with savings equal to S = Y1 - C1 > 0. Notice that the utility it attains U(C1*, C2*) is greater than U(Y1, Y2), the utility it would receive if it had stuck to its original intertemporal endowment and not saved or borrowed anything at all. Figure 6 - Consumption-Savings Decision It is not difficult to see that present consumption falls when the rate of interest rises. In other words, as interest rate rises, there is an incentive to save more (i.e. reduce consumption today further in favor of consumption tomorrow). Naturally, there are income effects that need to be accounted for, but we shall presume that this substitution effect dominates. Thus present consumption, C1 is negatively related to the rate of interest, r. Thus, in our general consumption function, C = C(Y, r), we have it that Cr < 0 or equivalently, S = S(Y, r) and Sr > 0, which is exactly what we wanted. (D) Some Difficulties It seems that the Neoclassical macromodel stands firm on its own foundations - or does it? We have already hinted at a few problems, let us pursue these for the moment. To see the first difficulty, let us ""close"" the model by placing all the markets together in one gigantic Walras's Law constraint (we are suppressing prices): (Md - Ms) + (Bd - Bs) + (Yd - Ys) + (Nd - Ns) = 0 where we have represented four market: money, bonds, goods and labor respectively. They must add up to zero by Walras's Law. We could represent (Yd - Ys) as (I - S) as they are equivalent (assuming government's budget is balanced). The Neoclassical story is then as follows: w/p clears the labor market (so (Nd - Ns) = 0), the price level clears the money market (so (Md - Ms) = 0), leaving the interest rate to clear the goods market (so (Yd - Ys) = 0) and hence, residually by Walras's Law, the interest rate clears the bond market as well (so (Bd - Bs) = 0). All is fine in the Neoclassical kingdom. But this statement allows all markets to affect each other: if there is excess demand in the goods market (Yd > Ys), then somewhere something must be in excess supply. This is simple Neoclassical logic: if something more is demanded and nothing else is supplied, then that demand must come from some deficiency in demand somewhere else. Thus market disequilibria spill over into each other. However, by assumption of dichotomy between money and real sides, we cannot have it that money market disequilibrium affects anything. Thus, we need it that (Md - Ms) = 0 at all times. Thus, the Walras's Law constraint is reduced to: (Bd - Bs) + (Yd - Ys) + (Nd - Ns) = 0 which is what Oskar Lange (1942) and Don Patinkin (1956) defined as ""Say's Law"", i.e. the demand for ""real"" things must equal the supply of ""real"" things, with no spillovers into the nominal things such as money. Is this a problem? Yes. We have eliminated the manner in which we get the determination of the price level from the money market. Fisher, Pigou, Cassel and company assumed that the price level would adjust by standard Neoclassical market-adjustment arguments and thought no further about it. But the ""standard arguments"" in Neoclassical theory rely on the concept of substitution between items - i.e. spillovers into other markets. Yet there is no substitution here because the money market is completely isolated from all other markets: money demand is ""fixed"" from outside and nominal money supply is also fixed. If money demand, for some reason, is different from money supply, there is no straightforward process of ""substitution"" that leads to the change in price level. The equilibrium condition, L(r, Y) = M/p or Md = Ms is, by the dichotomy assumption, a permanent condition that applies at all times. The problem with this is not only do we not know how the price level is supposed to adjust, but then the price level is actually indeterminate. If money demand always equals money supply, then the price level can be anything -- the money market will still clear. Furthermore, as Patinkin (1956) argues, the mechanisms of the Quantity Theory are violated. How? The Quantity Theory argued that if money supply rises, then prices would rise and the original Fisher (1911) argument was that the excess supply of money led to an excess demand for goods and that would raise prices which would in turn reduce the real supply of money. As excess real money supply fell, excess demand for goods would also fall. The new equilibrium would arise with output unchanged, but price level higher. But if money market is prevented from spilling over into the goods market - as the imposed dichotomy implies - how is this process supposed to happen? This failure was pointed out by Patinkin   (1948, 1956) who made the necessary corrections in the Neoclassical model to account for it. His correction was done by violating the dichotomy argument directly. We need nominal variables to somehow affect aggregate demand. He proposed this via a ""real balance"" or ""wealth"" effect on consumption. Patinkin's argument was that real money balances, M/p, enter the consumption demand equation so C = C(Y, r, M/p). An increase in the money supply increases real wealth (M/p), which thereby increases C and consequently Yd -- that gives us the necessary excess demand for goods to make the Quantity Theory work: with excess goods demand unmet, the prices for all goods rise, M/p falls back down and so does C and Yd back to Y. Neutrality still holds, but dichotomy is broken. Nevertheless, let us presume now that the money market does clear nicely. A second difficulty nonetheless arises. Consider the possibility of goods demand being so low that it intersects aggregate supply at a negative interest rate. In principle, negative prices are difficult to fathom in general so, in principle, the argument is usually made that the good in question becomes ""free"". In other words, if the demand and supply for peanuts intersect at a negative price, then we impose the ""complementary slackness"" condition that price of peanuts is zero, and thus we have, in ""equilibrium"", an excess supply of peanuts, i.e. peanuts are free. That is alright for a single good, but in the case of goods market, a negative interest rate cannot be rescued by assuming that interest rates are zero and thus ""all goods are free"". The implication is that if aggregate demand is low enough, the entire economy would be ""free"". Patinkin (1948) also envisaged that the real balance effect would save Neoclassical macroeconomics from this possibility: the excess supply of goods at zero interest would spillover into an excess demand for money. This would lower the price level and thus lead to an increase in real money supply. By the real balance effect, aggregate demand would rise again - bringing us back into positive interest (and thus an appropriately ""non-free"" economy). A third problem arises when examining our Walras' Law constraint. Suppose the interest rate clears the goods market, but, concurrently, that we still have an excess demand for bonds. This is possible - but it would imply we had an excess supply of labor. Thus, we can have unemployment even when the goods market clears if we allow spillovers from bond to labor markets. Thus, we can have ""too high"" interest rates (for the bond market) and ""too high"" wages simultaneously. Does this make sense? This is not very intuitive - as it implies that firms are somehow substituting labor for bonds. This is not insensible if we think of a firm somehow deciding to use their wage payments to purchase bonds instead (because they offer a ""higher return"" or something), but the intuition disappears once we ask why firms are reducing their demand for labor when the rate of return on bonds is already ""too high""? What does this mean for capital-labor substitution? The intuition is not clear, but it is mathematically allowable in the Walras's Law constraint. Furthermore, if the goods market is in equilibrium but the bond market is not (spilling over into labor), what is the rate of interest which equilibrates both bonds and goods? What are the mechanics implied here? An excess supply of bonds can only be moved back to equilibrium if the interest rate falls, but the interest rate will not fall if the goods market is in equlibrium. What now? If alternatively, we had such a large excess supply of labor so that both bonds and goods markets were in excess demand, then we would be simultaneously saying that the interest rate is expected to rise (from the goods market disequilibrium) and it is expected to fall (from the band market disequlibrium). Is this contradictory? One can suspect that these peculiar predicaments might lie in the fact that the Neoclassical model places together, in the same constraint flows (goods and labor demands) and stocks (bond demands). This could be corrected by simply realizing that they cannot be together as they have different time references. However, many economists - notably John Hicks (1939) and Don Patinkin (1956, 1958) - are adamant about ""everything depending on everything else"" and permitting stocks and flows to be in the same constraint by just adjusting a little bit. Hicks does make a point to speak of loanable funds entering the constraint in the form of flows (i.e. ""lending and borrowing"", thus ""credit"" instead of ""bonds"") but this does not remove the difficulty of contradictory interest rate movements in the case of an excess supply of labor. Lawrence Klein (1950) however, enters the fray here and surprisingly concludes that actually the bond/credit market has absolutely nothing to do with the rate of interest. The rate of interest, he claims, is determined by investment and savings, period. All the credit market does is determine the price level.   This is a bold statement, but if we accept it, then what role remains for the money market? There are two resolutions. The simplest is to claim that we were wrong to differentiate between the credit/bond market and the goods market to begin with. In other words, we placed them separately in the Walras's Law constraint, but that this was illegitimate. Goods demand is bond supply by definition and goods supply is bond demand by definition. There is no ""mutual mechanism"" between them. The interest rate is determined in one place alone: the goods market. The bond or credit market (stock or flow) is merely another term for ""goods market"" - they are one and the same thing. Thus, we either include the goods market or the bond market in the constraint, but not both simultaneously. This resolution is not particularly troublesome since we introduced bond demand and supply in precisely this manner. But while it is not counterintuitive, it is not that obvious either: the demand and supply of credit can indeed be reconciled with investment and savings, but are they really the same thing exactly? If so, then we would be arguing in the ""real funds"" framework of Fisher's (1930) theory, but have precluded the plausible Wicksellian modifications brought in by Robertson (1937, 1940) and Ohlin (1937). A second resolution is to follow Sargent (1979) and remove the simulteneity implied in our Walras's Law constraint and deal with the model in a block recursive form. In short, we impose two Walras's Law constraints, namely: (Nd - Ns) = 0 (Bd - Bs) + (Yd - Ys) = 0 so that the bond/goods market determines the interest rate and the labor market determines the real wage rate alone. The interest rate, then, is argued to be absolutely determined by the bond market - and so, as the previous analysis insinuates, bond and goods markets are both equilibrated by a single, common interest rate. However, the problem arises that now the labor market must clear at all times (no disequilibrium being implied by the constraint) and thus, analagously with the problem we faced in the money market, the real wage becomes indeterminate! The way out of this would be to include capital - which is what labor substituted for in the first place, was it not? That long-forgotten, out-of-the-system variable must now be included again. In this case, we must rewrite the system as follows: (Nd - Ns) + (Kd - Ks) = 0 (Bd - Bs) + (Yd - Ys) = 0 so the equilibrating mechanism between the factors is (w/p)/r, the ratio of factor returns. In this case, the real wage is still indeterminate, only relative factor returns are determined in equilibrium. But we can now pin down the real wage by recognizing that r falls out of the second bond/goods constraint. Thus, second constraint can be used to pin down a value for r which will, in turn, pin down a value for (w/p). The first equation gives us (w/p)/r, the second r, so using all this, we can determine (w/p) exactly. If, in addition, we can also pin down p in the money market (somehow), then we would have the additional benefit that the nominal wage (w) would also be determinate. The system, then, would become entirely solvable. Or is it? Now we have capital stocks again - and again we must be careful of its relationship with investment. Recall that investment is positive only if capital is not at its optimal level, K* (otherwise there would be no point in investing). Imposing the adjustment cost story does not solve things entirely: in a period where investment is positive, capital would be below optimal capital stock. By the microeconomic theory of the firm, the cost-minimizing choice with capital constrained below K* would be that labor demand would be above optimal labor, L* at the given real wage rate. In fact, a simple isoquant exercise could demonstrate that with constrained capital stock, labor is hired where ¦ L/¦ K < (w/p)/r so that the real wage is actually too high! So much for factor-side equilibrium. As long as investment is positive, things go awry in the factor markets. Attempts at resolutions have been made in investment theory, but they have not been solved to everyone's satisfaction. However, the incorporation of growth theory of the Solowian brand in Neoclassical macromodels has enabled modern macroeconomists to largely circumvent this problem. Note that if labor is growing at some ""natural rate"", then this ""disequilibrium"" arising from stock-flow confusion is eliminated almost completely as movements in capital will be accompanied by movements in labor. Thus, we can speak of steady market clearing factor prices and an optimal capital-labor ratio which can be largely reconciled with investment flows. It is a simple maneouvre, but one the old Neoclassicals did not really come up with. The cost of incorporating growth is that the idea of ""investment"" as an independent behavioral phenomena becomes gradually eclipsed by complete determination by household savings and growth - making rich financial markets and independent firm investment decisions an almost superfluous consideration. In sum, there are particular problems in the formulation of the static Neoclassical model as we have presented it. Of course, one may argue, together with John Hicks (1939: p.154), that these are not real issues: in a general equilibrium system, real wages, interest rates, prices and quantities will be determined somehow, it does not particularly matter where. While this may be true, it does not lend us any insight into the workings of the macroeconomy. What is specifically of interest here is whether interest rates or real wages or whatever equilibrate particular markets. Furthermore, we must note that we are describing a rather simplistic Neoclassical system rather a fully-fledged Walrasian general equilibrium system. Both share the most important features of Neoclassical economics, but there are important points of departure between these as well. Top Selected References Back   All rights reserved, Gonçalo L.

(Roy F. Harrod, 1939, Oxford EP) ________________________________________________________ Contents (A) The Old Marginalism Debate
(B) The New Institutionalist Theories
(C) The Evolutionary Theory of the Firm Back (A) The Old Marginalism Debate The ""Marginalism"" debate emerged in the late 1930s after several studies - one by the Oxford Research Group (see Hall and Hitch, 1939) and another by R.A. Lester (1946) had argued that, empirically, it was not apparent that entrepreneurs followed the marginalist principles of profit- maximization/cost-minimizations in running their firms. In particular, they found that many firms conducting ""full cost"" pricing rules and routines and that predicted falls in employment as a result of higher wages were not evident. They consequently questioned the relevance of the profit-maximization assumption in Neoclassical theories of the firm. The Oxford results were accompanied by a paper from Harrod (1939) which argued that perhaps profit- maximization was not observed in many firms partly because the necessary information - marginal revenue and costs - for such calculations was hard to obtain. Yet, he added, decisions would nonetheless be made and that there may be a ""natural selection"" process at work whereby, because of its superior results, the profit-maximizing decision would be selected for and other decisions selected against. Thus, Harrod argued, entrepreneurs may not get profit-maximization exactly, but they would in actuality ""grope"" for it. The studies provoked an immediate response on the part of Fritz Machlup (1946, 1947) and George J. Stigler (1946, 1947). They defended the marginalist principle assiduously, but on different lines than Harrod. In particular, Machlup argued that the Oxford Group's find that firms often follow established ""routines"" rather than make deliberate, careful decisions could mean that, in earlier times when the routines were established, they were the profit-maximizing procedure and had simply not been updated in light of new circumstances. Furthermore, even if they did not have their roots in conscious decisions, one must be careful about the meaning of marginalist analysis: as Machlup notes, there are many factors which may affect profits and thus, as many traditional relations implied by profit maximization (e.g. rise in wages leading to less employment) are often considered in theoretical isolation, they are rarely isolated in fact. As such, some of these individual relations may not be observed in empirical studies, but it does not mean they do not exist. Using his famous analogy of the decision of a driver to overtake another car on a road, Machlup (1946: p.534) argued that particular considerations such as the speed of the other car, the speed of one's own, distance, etc. certainly have individual impact on the decision, but all these factors operate at once and the car-driver is often forced to ""size-up"" the situation as a whole and make a decision. Similarly, entrepreneurs are forced to ""size up"" a total situation and thus empirical researchers might not be able to differentiate and trace the impact of different, isolated components on business decisions. But the theory of profit-maximization - like the ""theory of overtaking"" - must write down all the components separately. Armen Alchian (1950, 1953) took issue with both Machlup and the anti-Marginalists. His argument was that, quite simply, the Neoclassical theory of the firm is not about firms as such but industries. Individual firms, Alchian argued, essentially followed the routines claimed by the researchers, but it would be the industry which adheres to the marginalist principles. Thus, if wages rise, we should see the average industry labor employment fall, but this is not because firms change their techniques of production (i.e. they don't hire more labor), but rather because those firms which happen to have the routine which corresponds to the new optimal labor employment will be more profitable than those that do not. In what is considered today a classical paper on evolutionary theory, Alchian (1950) proceeded to make a ""natural selection"" argument (although substantially different from that of Harrod (1939)): the profitable firms (those which, by luck(?), had the optimal routine) would last longer while those which were less profitable (did not have the optimal routine) would soon go out of business. Thus, the industry as a whole would move towards the ""optimal"" decision, not because firms change their behavior, but rather because those firms lucky enough to have the optimal routine will be selected for by this process and those which do not will be selected against. Thus, profit-maximization, Alchian argued, is not a result of firm decisions but rather a result of an evolutionary process being conducted at an industry wide-level. The Marginalist principle, thus, is fully applicable to the industry, albeit not the firm. Penrose (1952, 1953) took issue with Alchian. If ""market forces"", as Alchian argued, were the natural selectors, then there is a presupposition that competition exists. What she goes on to ask is what generates competition if not the very profit-seeking motives of entrepreneurs? Alchian (1953) responds quite clearly that Penrose confused intended profits and realized profits: the selection procedure is simply on the basis of realized profits that permit a firm to continue operating; it is not necesary that they actually search for them. Alchian's argument that profit-maximization behavior on the part of entrepreneurs is irrelevant for the result that industry will attain the profit-maximizing solution was taken by Milton Friedman to a ridiculous extreme in his 1953 paper on ""positivist"" methodology. He, however, seems to forget Alchian's argument half-way and proceeds to make his famous ""billiards"" analogy which attempted to argue that agents who do not profit-maximize will be selected against. This is again a confusion of intended profits and realized profits that is necessary for Alchian's arguments. Gary Becker (1962) follows up on Alchian and refines his argument somewhat: the selection procedure Becker envisions is that of collapsing budgetary constraints for non- profit-maximizing behavior. Firms, Becker argued, cannot survive for long with the wrong routine regardless of what their motives are. If firms are resource-constrained (!), they will shrink and then go out of business if they do not have the optimal routine wheras those who do and are reaping profits will grow. Thus, Becker demolishes Friedman while restoring the original meaning of Alchian's theory. Israel Kirzner (1962), however, takes issue with Alchian and Becker and asks the simple question: are not prices the outcomes of behavior in equilibrium? Alchian and Becker argued on the basis that if, say, prices change, the budget constraints of firms with the optimal routine would expand wheras those without it would contract. But are not these changes in price, indeed the very phenomenon of price, a result of interacting agents (and thus firms)? Why should they act as price- takers? Would not irrational decisions implicate the resulting prices and thus the degree and the manner by which budgets contract? Prices, Kirzner argues, are outcomes and not data of economic processes. It is possible, Kirzner's view, for the ""wrong"" firms to continue making profits and survive. (B) New Institutionalist Theories The Marginalist debate changed tone in the 1970s with the emergence of the theories of agency costs, property rights, transactions costs theories of the firm. The new theories of the firm attempted to prove a variant of Friedman's (1953) conjecture that firms which had profit-maximizing behavior would be selected for. More precisely, they argued that firms with ""efficient"" organization would be selected for whereas those which were run inefficiently would be selected against. Here the object of study changed from how to reconcile firm behavior with marginalist principles to how to reconcile firm structure with marginalist principles. This concern was first taken up by R.H. Coase (1937) when he noted the apparent disparity between the marginalist notion that markets were efficient organizers of resources with the existence of highly hierarchical, control structures within firms. If the Neoclassicals were at all right in the Socialist Calculation debate, it would seem at least somewhat peculiar to find ""command economies"" operating internally within capitalist firms. Why not use the price mechanism within firms as well? Coase's (1937) conclusion was that transactions costs were high, or rather that within firms, command structures had lower transactions costs than using price mechanisms. (it does not take much imagination to perceive the similarity between Coase's (1937) arguments for the firm and Oskar Lange's (1936, 1938) for the economy in the Socialist Calculation debates!) The challenge to Coase was set up by Alchian and Demsetz (1972). What they essentially argued was that it was not that command structures minimized transactions costs, but rather that they minimized ""monitoring costs"". As many of the firm's processes involve team production, then there will necessarily be monitoring costs to assess individual efforts within a team. In order to overcome shirking in team production, firms assign a central agent the monitoring role - and that this central agent is himself discouraged to shirk by making him the ""residual claimant"" of the earnings of the team. As a result, the residual claimant must be given ""property rights"" over the output. In short, Alchian and Demsetz (1972) justify the role of the profit-earning entrepreneur and a command structure - i.e. the capitalist firm - as a result of what can be argued to be a series of market-based contracts. Alchian and Demsetz's idea that the behavior of the firm is in fact not too different from the behavior of the market was also famously proposed by Jensen and Meckling (1976) who purse the idea of ""agency costs"" as the source of firm structure. Even in modern firms, where management is divorced from residual claims, external equity and bond markets in effect play the role of the monitoring agency on managers. Fama (1980) has gone on to claim that even if management truly does not care about financial markets, they still care about the market for managerial labor which can induce management to perform their monitor role more seriously. Fama and Jensen (1983), indeed, pursue factor market arguments in general in this regard. Of course, if all fails in the end to overcome agency costs, there is always that ultimate market disciplining device: the hostile takeover. Thus, at least since Alchian and Demsetz (1972), the internal organization of firms has been argued, contra Coase, to be dominated and explained by market relationships in the presence of agency costs. Firms are not independent of market disciplinary devices. A form of the Coase position was famously resurrected by Oliver E. Wiliamson (1985, 1987, 1991). invoking the Herbert Simon's theory of bounded rationality and opportunism. ""Opportunism"" is simply self- interested behavior, ""bounded rationality"" implies however that full agency contracts cannot be written up because not all contingencies can be forseen. Furthermore, when there is ""asset specificity"" (i.e. factors particular to the firm), then factor market disciplinary devices simply will not be available. Thus, Williamson informs us, while there will be high ex ante market-influenced competitive bidding before contracts between firm and outside agents are signed, this contract does not fully account for all problems that may arise in the future. The ""opportunistic"" character of the agents imply that they will diverge from their contract-assigned purpose if they can and find it profitable to do so; bounded rationality implies that the original contracts could not account for all the possible ways agents could diverge. They could bring the contracts back to market every time they find divergence, but this would be costly. Thus, in sum, Williamson argues that ex ante bidding is competitive, but ex post firms face ""sunk costs"" in this respect and thus to modify contracts in response to new behavioral incentives would involve heavy transactions costs (i.e. opening up bidding in factor markets again to replace the shirking or irresponsible manager or worker). Thus, firms do exhibit a hierarchical non-market structure internally which is independent of market disciplining devices largely because of transactions costs. This has been the heart of the New Institutional economics. (C) The Evolutionary Theory of the Firm The old marginalist debate re-emerged in the 1980s with the evolutionary theory of Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter (1982) which combined the earlier Alchian-Becker arguments with the theories of the firm of the New Institionalists.

Economics Journals: A chronology,"Much of what follows is a highly speculative sketch on the historical development of economic journals;  we are looking for any good resource or authority on the history of these journals to correct our brief account. Key:     * - ""Light"", ""political"" or ""news-oriented"" economics journal/magazine
             # - not principally dedicated to economics; only occasionally publishes economics essays.  Dates specify date of first issue (and, if applicable, last issue).  Journals are ordered chronologically from date of first issue.  Acronyms and nicknames we use in this website are given under journal titles.  (Click here for alphabetical list of journal acronyms) Pre-Enlightenment (pre-1750) The means of communication of economic ideas have, of course, varied over the centuries.  Medieval scholastic writers expressed their economic theories mostly in religious treatises on law and justice (De justitie et jure).  In the 17th and 18th Centuries, Mercantilists and other economic writers published their work (usually anonymously) as pamphlets of persuastion, usually addressed to rulers and parliaments, in the hope of influencing policy.  Some (e.g. Cameralists) were already state officials, and publishing handbooks for their successors.  Throughout this time, only a handful of regularly-published journals existed.  These were set up largely to review scientific literature that was published elsewhere rather than as a repository for new essay-length treatises.  The two leading serious journals in Europe were the French Journal des Savants and the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.  In the 1690s we begin seeing the first commercial newspapers, put out as reading materials for the merchant customers of London coffee houses.  In the early 1700s starts the great explosion of Augustan literary reviews, - DeFoe's Review, Swift's Examiner, and Steele & Addison's Spectator, usually written singlehandedly. While dedicated to politics, satire and scandal, they could occasionally turn to economic and financial matters.  Journal des Savants (France, 1665-)# Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (Britain, 1665-)#  Nouvelles de la république des lettres (France, 1685-1710)# Lloyd's List and Shipping Gazette, (Britain, 1696-) The Course of the Exchange, and Other Things (1698-) A Review of the Affairs of France: and of all Europe, as influence'd by that nation (1704-1712)#* The Tatler (Britain, 1709-1711)#* The Examiner (Britain, 1710-1714)#* The Spectator (Britain, 1711-1714)#* Enlightenment Journals (c. 1750-1800) Around the mid-18th Century, gripped by the Enlightenment spirit, a new means of communication emerged, the learned journal or review.  The demand during this period was clear: the middle classes were looking for ""self-improvement"", the educated classes looking for exciting debates and new ideas, and for the nobility looking for topics for social conversation (perfect for poseurs!).   The success of  Denis Diderot's Encyclopèdie, published between 1751 and 1765, was the great spur for the development of journals.  True, the public had always demanded magazines -- weekly or monthly publications dedicated to witty, political position papers, current news or contemporary dramatic and literary criticism, like the early 18th century light magazines Mercure de France or the Tatler and Spectator.  But what the Encyclopèdie specifically taught was that the public was willing to digest high-level theoretical essays -- bound together, published regularly over time and distributed as fascicules to subscribers. In short, journals.   It seems as if encyclopedias, and not magazines, are the true antecedents of the modern scholarly journal. There was an explosion of high-quality learned journals in the 1750s and 1760s, particularly in France.  Several of them were exclusively dedicated to serious treatises on political economy.   The following were the leading journals of the period where economic writers were welcome:  Scots Magazine (Britain, 1739-1826)# Encyclopèdie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des métiers et des arts. (France, 1751-1765)# Journal oeconomique (France, 1751-1772) Novelliste Oeconomique et Littéraire (France, 1754-1761) Edinburgh Review (Britain, 1755-1756)# Journal du Commerce (Belgium, 1759-1762) Gazette du Commerce (France, 1763-1783)* Journal d'agriculture, du commerce et des finances (France, 1765-1783) Ephémérides du Citoyen (France, 1765-1772) Nouvelles Ephémérides Economiques (France, 1774-1766, 1788?). Ephemeriden der Menschheit (Germany, 1776-1782) Treatises and Reviews  (c.1800-1850) Then something happened.  We are not quite sure what,  but it seems as if, by at least the early 1790s, many of the learned journals  disappeared.  Doubtlessly, some were closed down by the nervousness of kings and clergy.  Perhaps this was reinforced by the passing of the Enlightenment's penchant for self-improvement and the subsequent exigencies of revolution and war.  What seems certain is that the means of economic communication entered a new phase.  Economic essays continued to be written, but without specialized journals, distribution was a problem.  For the most part, essay-length treatises were turned either into policy pamphlets, or entries into encyclopedias (and numerous ones were intermittently cobbled together) or were snuck into the (few) existing journals of other scientific fields (statistical journals were a particular favorite).  Alternatively, they could write a book.  It was around this time that the first book-length (and, more interestingly, signed) treatises in economics began to appear.  The first were probably those of Sir James Steuart (1767) and Adam Smith (1776).   Virtually every economist of the time -- such as Say, Ricardo and Malthus --  eventually attempted their hand at a comprehensive, book-length  ""treatise"".  While excellent in offering the author free reign in abstract theorizing, the book-length treatise was not always a good means of transmitting new ideas and generating scholarly debate.  Often written as textbooks (to convince publishers of sales value), readers would have to dig through two hundred or so pages of elementary, well-known basic principles and mountains of definitions and illustrative examples, before finally reaching the theoretical ""meat"".   This was also the time of the great British ""reviews"" - the Whiggish Edinburgh Review (f.1802), the staunchly Tory Quarterly Review (1809), Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine (1817), the Benthamite Westminster Review (1824), etc.  But these reviews were a throwback to the pre-Enlightenment formula - that is, geared to reviewing existing pamphlets and treatises, rather than a medium for original essays.  To be sure, the reviewers inserted their own perspectives in the reviews, but there wasn't space for the kind of abstract, focused theoretical treatment you would have found in the Enlightenment journals.  Of the four, the Edinburgh Review probably commands pride of place of retaining a high equality focus on economics from its inception until at least the 1840s.  The others were more news-oriented, general-topic magazines. Finally, we should make mention of the production of small volumes for popular consumption - like  Jane Marcet (1816) and Harriet Martineau (1834).  These outlined economic principles for general ""low-brow"" consumption.  One should also take note of  the emergence of magazines such as the weekly The Economist and the monthly Journal des économistes. Lighter and more journalistic than the reviews, these magazines were at least a bit more focused on issues related to political economy.  Naturally, there was even less room for abstract theoretical essays in these magazines, but they were important channels by which economists could influence the general public opinion on economic policies and issues of the day.   The following is a selection of the the major periodicals of this era: La Décade philosophique (France, 1794-?) Journal des débats (1789-1842)*# Journal d'économie publique, de morale et de politique (France, 1796-?)* Annales de statistique, ou Journal d'économie politique, industrielle et commerciale, de géographie, d'histoire naturelle, d'agriculture, de physique, d'hygiène et de littérature (France, 1801-?)# Edinburgh Review (Britain, 1802-1929)#   Quarterly Review (Britain 1809-1967)# Le Censeur, (France 1814-15)#   Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine (Britain, 1817-1980)*# Le Censeur Européen ou Examen de diverses questions de droit public et de divers, (France 1818)#   Revue Encyclopédique (France, 1819-1835)# Westminster Review (Britain, 1824-1914)# The Spectator (Britain, 1828-)*# Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country (Britain, 1830-)*# Proceedings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (Britain, 1833-) Journal of the (Royal) Statistical Society of London  (Britain, 1838-)# Bulletin of Manchester Statistical Society (Britain, 1833-)# Journal des économistes (France, 1841-1940)* New York Daily Tribune (U.S., 1841-1924) Punch Magazine (Britain, 1841-)*# Rheinische Zeitung für Politik, Handel und Gewerbe (Germany, 1842-1843) The Economist (Britain, 1843-)* New Englander and Yale Review (U.S., 1843-1892)*# Libre-Échange (France, 1846-?)* Neue Rheinische Zeitung: Organ für demokratie (Germany, 1848-1849) Emergence of Academic Economics Journals (c.1850-c.1915) The specialized, scholarly journals we are familiar with today emerged around mid-century in Central Europe.  The serious research traditions and early academic professionalization in Continental European universities required a serious outlet -- and this generated the resurrection of the scholarly journal.   The Anglo-American universities, which still seemed like  ""young gentlemen finishing schools"" during much of this period , caught up much more slowly.  However, nearing the turn of the century, there emerged a series of ""new"" research universities along Continental lines, such as Johns Hopkins, Chicago, M.I.T. and the  L.S.E..  The research needs and the competitive spirit of these fledgling institutions encouraged the exploration of various avenues by which to make their institutional mark on the academic landscape.  At every step, their efforts were copied by the older universities such as Cambridge, Harvard and Yale who were eager not to be left behind and, in the process, reinvented themselves as research schools.  Creating professional associations and launching journals was a quick way of raising the profile of a university and stamping it as a ""serious"" research institution.  Hosting a journal is always good way to attract attention, but what is even better is that by controlling the editorship of the house journal, the universities simultaneously ensured that their own faculty's publication lists will climb a lot faster than those of others.   The incentive to establish journals in economics was even greater than for other fields: recall that the status of economics as a serious, ""scientific"" subject was in grave doubt in the 1860s and 1870s, thus anything that could be done to ""legitimize"" it professionally was encouraged.  Thus, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, the American Economic Association, the Royal Economic Society, the Journal of Political Economy, etc. were all clear attempts by  professional academic economists to not only raise the profiles of their universities on a national scale, but also that of their departments within the university. Also worth mentioning was the rise of the left-wing economics magazine during this period.  As labor movements, cooperatives and more radical socialist movements emerged, they found themselves uniformly opposed by the conventional reviews and magazines.  They thus created their own -- not only to influence wider public opinion, but also to raise the political and economic consciousness of the working classes they claimed to represent.  Most of these did not last long -- usually for lack of funds and/or political suppression. But a handful of ones -- particular those associated with established parties (e.g.  Labour in Britain) -- managed to survive into the next era. The following economics periodicals were begun in this period: Zeitschrift für die gesamte staatswissenschaft (Germany, 1844-) Bulletin de la Société d'économie politique (France,1846-) De Economist ((Netherlands, 1852-)  The Atlantic Monthly (U.S., 1857-)*# Macmillan's Magazine (Britain, 1859-?)

After World War I, numerous ""new"" institutions hungry for attention absorbed the lesson and put out a journal.  Many of these institutions included attention-hungry universities like L.S.E, Manchester, Osaka, Oxford, Louvain, the New School, etc.  New research institutes, like Kiel Institute and the Institut de Sciences Economiques Appliqueés, did the same.  In a peculiar twist, entire countries (e.g. Australia, South Africa, Canada,  Scotland, etc.) brought out journals as flag-carriers, symbols of national research prestige.  Even commercial banks and companies, such as Lloyds and Banca Nazionale de Lavoro introduced house journals. A second kind of journal emerged in this period -- namely, those created in response to the restrictive editorial policies of the older journals.  Particularly important were Econometrica and the Review of Economic Studies created by economists frustrated at the anti-mathematical bent of the existing journals.  Similarly, Metroeconomica and the Journal of Economic Issues, were created in response to the refusal of older journals to consider articles which were not written in accordance with the dominant Anglo-American economic orthodoxy of the day.   The following journals were created during this period (many institutionally-backed journals are generalist, so we don't give details for all).

Although they relieved a good amount of backlog that had been accumulating, they were not specialist journals.  But academic economists are specialized people.  That means that the average subscriber to, say, the Bohemian Journal of Economics would have to consider himself extraordinarily lucky to find one or two articles of interest in every journal issue he received.  A specialized journal would be nice, they thought, but which institution is to provide it?  The easiest way was to form haphazard ""societies"" in a specialized academic subject and then hire a commercial publishing house to publish the ""society's"" journal.  Sometimes, one can dispense with the society altogether.  It was in some version of this that specialized journals -- such as the Journal of Economic Theory, the Journal of Public Economics, the Journal of Monetary Economics, etc. -- emerged.   Many of these were highly successful, climbing quickly in prestige over the older institution-backed journals. The need was certainly there for many of them.  But by the late 1980s, and certainly the mid-1990s, many people argue that things have gone perhaps a bit overboard (not only in economics, but in many other fields as well).   The big commercial publishing houses (you know who they are!) caught on to the game quickly enough.  Whatever journal they put out, there is always a demand (i.e. at worst, there are the university libraries who are generally ""forced"" to buy them).  Similarly, there is always a supply (economists, pressed by ""publish-or-perish"", always have articles).  And finding an editor is always easy (editorship of a journal brings professional prestige to an individual in the academic rat race -- a slight variation on the institutional prestige theme we talked about earlier).  So, in recent years, the publishing houses have been pushing journals like there was no tomorrow:  every topic and sub-topic and sub-sub-topic has its own journal today.   It is easy to see why this has gone too far: most are unaffordable to individuals (exorbitant prices are set to gouge libraries), quality per issue has declined (the few good articles in a field end up being spread too thin among the many competing journals) and, some claim, the situation has degenerated to the point where the publishing houses will gleefully put out ""personal boutique"" journals -- where little beyond the editor's own vanity or bid for self-promotion justifies its existence.  Currently, economics is the discipline with the largest number of new journals every year. Specialization, of course, breeds blinders -- so demand for a second type of journal -- the ""survey"" journal -- emerged in this period.  These journals collect and publish comprehensive and easy-to-understand surveys of the state of the art in various topics and fields.  Such surveys used to be occasionally published by the conventional journals such as Econometrica, as a way for specialists in other fields to have an idea what was going on somewhere else.   However, the degree of specialization in economics is such that more surveys are necessary, and ever more often, and ever simpler. There are now a handful of journals, such as the Journal of Economic Literature and the Journal of Economic Perspectives, dedicated exclusively to surveys.  [It has been speculated that the old general-purpose conventional journals might eventually be done in by this trend: economists today are happy enough to concentrate all their journal-reading on their own specialized sub-sub-field journal plus one or two general survey journals.] A third type of journal emerged in this period: the heterodox journal, such as the Review of Radical Political Economy, the Journal of Post Keynesian Economics, the Cambridge Journal of Economics, etc. These were established as non-mainstream economists were increasingly finding themselves blocked out of the existing journals.   Consequently, they organized themselves and formed journals dedicated to their own school-of-thought -- not unlike the mathematical economists did with Econometrica and RES in the early 1930s.  However, we should emphasize that the heterodox journal arose not out of a bid by a school of thought for institutional legitimacy. Indeed, some claim that quite the reverse happened: the worst thing for a heterodox school of thought to do is to ""ghettoize"" itself out of the mainstream with a journal (there is an exception to this rule: the early prestige of the JPE ensured that the Chicago School could ghettoize itself without appearing to actually do so).  Rather,  the emergence of the heterodox journal was an indicator of how bad things really got in terms of editorial decisions of the conventional journals. The following journals were established in this period.  We cannot hope to list all the publishing house journals here so the list just captures a few of the (more legitimate) earlier ones.

The Walrasiad,"------------- ------------- ABDUL THE GOATHERD Oracle of the Gods and Humble Storyteller (translated from the ancient mathuscript by Gonçalo L. Fonseca) ""Hear then, o Economidae, nymphs of the streams
Of infinitely discussed yet discounted prophets,
Of the story which I sing: the epic of men
And women locked in the battle of egos and coherence,
Precision and relevance, the song for all ages
And peoples to hear and revere the great and poor
Deeds of this tribe of malcontents and heroes... In the beginning there was mercantilism. Then God created Adam Smith. Some would argue that the first being was in fact French - a Cantillon or a Quesnay to be precise - and your humble storyteller would certainly lean towards such an interpretation. But the consensus of our elders (those rotten English dogs) tells us that, instead, economics began with Adam's creation. But to begin our story like this is already to court trouble. You see, dear reader, Adam Smith contained in him elements of both the Hebrew and the Greek deities. The Hebraic aspect of Adam spoke of judgement and ""moral sentiments"". But the Hellenic side told stories of the magical ""invisible hand"" of the gods, with virtue self-defined and judgement suspended. The parables Adam subsequently bequeathed upon his progeny only left them bewildered in this respect. Paradoxically, it was a Jew that settled this dispute by putting the car firmly on Greek rather than Hebraic rails: the magnificent David Ricardo of London. But be warned, gracious reader, that once again this account is gathered from the stories of the elders (the same rotten English dogs) - a more Gallic interpretation would have bestowed these laurels on the brow of Jean-Baptiste Say. Nonetheless, your meek storyteller must proceed with the song. Concordant with his Apollonic demeanor, David Ricardo was entirely Hellenic in his economic vision: his individuals were mostly passive, the puny playthings of the objective gods of history and structure. Yet, as Euripides of Hellas, Ricardo of London did have his Orestreian heroes: the persecuted entrepreneurs, fighting against the furies of diminishing marginal returns to land - only to be saved occasionally by the graceful hands of the enlightened priestesses of free trade and technological change. But the petty and vengeful gods looked upon these humans as haughty and verily regarded their haughtiness with disdain. Disguised as landlords, the gods stealthily walked among the heroes and cast plagues and misery upon them. Inexorably, sang Ricardo, no matter how brave or bold the capitalist heroes might be, the gods were destined to win in the end. Thus was born the Classical Tragedy. Ricardo's more Hebraic but even more somber friend, Thomas Malthus, tried to paint something of a moral story in it, but the dismal Ricardian canon won out - particularly when enshrined in the McCullochian Elegies and the even more famous Tales from the Millian Nights. But all was soon not well in the Classical realm. Behind them, a flock of avenging Eumenides, such horribly named as Lauderdale, Longfield and Senior, cast their disequilibrating curses upon the Ricardian poets. Whereas, across the wide channel, under the volcanoes of barbarous lands, the cyclops Cournot, Gossen and von Thünen forged in silent sweat the marginal weapons which were to be given to the murderers of the gods. Yet even before the Hellenic Ricardians had grasped but the breadth of this challenge, a lonely Roman, an usurping Caesar arose in their midst. The Classical system was Latinized by Karlus Marxius. Informed by Hegelius' chronicles of Teutonic mythology, he wrote a new theogony - reinterpreting the history of the gods and how they were born and lived and died and were replaced by new races of gods - for, indeed, in Marxius' theory, everything in this world was so full of contradictions that even the immortal gods were mortal. Marxius's theogony seemed more fit for the more violent and militant times of the advanced iron age. In Marxius's hands, the genteel Hellenic Classicism of Ricardo and Mill was replaced with more visceral Latin elements: the biting language and rhetoric reminiscent of a Juvenal or Horace - combined with the political oratory and visions of a Cato or Cicero, the idealism of a Varro and the analytical power and historical sweep of a Tacitus. This Marxius, so your humble storyteller must testify, was certainly no Hellene: if Ricardo had appeared as a gentlemanly Apollo, Marxius came forth as a virulent, bearded Mars. Marxius's contributions to the Classical Canon were themselves found in a long ruminating summation of the logic of capital, in short, a ""Summa Capitalogica"". There, he provided a very detailed and comprehensive analysis in the Classical vein. His use of Ricardian metres was obvious but his conclusions were astoundingly different. For instance, in Marxius' theogony, the gods were even more merciless to the cursed House of Capital: a special place was reserved for them in Tartarus where, like Tantalus of old, they were endowed with a raging thirst for profit and then placed in the middle of the ever-receding Lake of the Profit Rate. But, perhaps following the steps of Paracelsus, Marxius's search for the Elixir of the Transformation Problem proved to be a vexing difficulty - and far from being life-giving, this search only served to drive him and his works to their grave. Although the image of Marxius has served to embellish many a town square and eastern temple over the years, in more recent times, the ""Summa Capitalogica"" has been kept only in the carefully-watched vaults of a few secret monasteries - where only a handful of men, the scholastic monks of the Holy Marxian Order, have access to it and serve as curators of Marxius's flame. Nonetheless, dear reader, by the time of Marxius' ""Summa"", the Classical Canon was in its death throes. The agents of Ricardian economics, many had concluded, were too passive to be deemed a suitable construct; the determination of prices and outputs, which is ostensibly a human affair, and the fate of economic activity was still in the hands of the gods of objective structures. Throughout the land of the Econ, many Olympian demi-gods, haunted by the cursing shrieks of so many Eumenides, were themselves growing increasingly restless. In the year 1871 (or was it 1874?), three young Prometheans, the romantic bohemian Léon Walras of Lausanne, the rebellious and revolted William Stanley Jevons of Manchester and the tortured daydreamer Carl Menger of Vienna were secretly armed by the cyclops. Leaping on their marginally winged mechanical steeds, the three riders stormed up from earth, broke through the gates of Olympus, dethroned the gods and proclaimed the ascendancy of a new age: the rule of subjective value theory - where humans, not history nor gods, would determine the course of events. Yes, dear reader, it was to be the rule of man over the world - for with an almost existentialist flavor (occasionally laced with mathematics), the element of individual ""choices"" interacting with each other became the prime and sole determinant of the system rather than the inexorable fancies of the objective gods. Economically speaking, then, Heidegger overthrew Hegel in 1871. Then the big brothers emerged. With the same practical, cold- blooded assiduousness that characterized Robespierre after Desmoullins, the brutally pragmatic Alfred Marshall and his minions laid their hands on the revolution and proceeded to thwart its entire meaning. Elements of the Ancien Regime began to reappear in the new textbooks - where the old objective supply curves were imposed on the new subjective demand curves regardless of ideological purity. Under their rule, the revolution was institutionalized, professionalized, sanitized and, in many ways, defanged. Indeed, to confuse the populace as to its origin and essence, it was called by the blasphemous and meaningless term ""Neoclassical"". Some rebels such as the sardonic Vilfredo Pareto, the deranged, wild-eyed Knut Wicksell and the brilliant youngster and scholar, Philip Wicksteed, maintained something of the original flavor of the Promethean revolution in their oratories - but they were exiled to the ends of the economic world, chained and gagged by unhelpful editors and hostile university committees. The usurper, Alfred Marshall, founded a new dynasty that was to rule economics for a very, very long time. Paradoxically, the Marshallian Hussars set out to silence the dissidents were sometimes accompanied by something of a devil: a mouse-looking sort of reluctant captain with an even stranger name, Francis Ysidro Edgeworth. With his eccentric passion for long words, statistical equations and recontracting, he was verily a true son of Albion. Yet his apparent treachery was a function of his modesty: for such a humble man, who had once crafted mathematical and conceptual thunderbolts to lend to the revolutionaries, had later decided to step back into the shades so as to not be part of the coalition that might block the light away from the Cantabrigian monarch. A less troubling case was that of another promising young Promethean, named Irving Fisher of New Haven. Every once in a while, he added his Promethean fire to the Walrasian flame, but he oftentimes extinguished himself with excess supplies of paper money. Although often invoked, we must note that he did not serve in the Marshallian regiments (indeed, he was a pacifist) and quietly went on to invent new indexing systems for merchants, new diets for the rich and new genes for the poor. Yet, dear reader, around the Alpine mountains where no rotten English dogs bark and the air is pristine and filled with utility, where water is more scarce than diamonds, where time is so subjective it seems to fly by in an instant, an Epicurean group had gathered around the aged Menger to chant the magical words of yet another Dutch Jew of Portuguese descent: ""The primary and sole foundation of virtue or of the proper conduct of life is to seek our own profit"". These words of Baruch Spinoza, from many suitably discounted centuries before, entranced the young Tyroleans. Little Eugen, Friedrich, Ludwig, Josef, Fritz, the young mad baron von Hayek and other irreducibly uncertain boys locked themselves in the ministries and seminar rooms of the Austrian capital and dreamed of following the style of the eternal Spinoza and so build an axiomatic-deductive edifice to explain the ways of markets to men. The Anglo-Saxon fingers also slipped from the throats of tree- cutters in the frozen forests of Sweden. This was, after all, the home of that Promethean demon, Knut Wicksell - who would bow to no king (not even the Swedish one) and taught his students well in the art of economics and poorly in the art of professional advancement. He brought unto the heathen Vikings not the tepid tomes of England but rather the prayerbooks of the Austrians and the bibles of Lausanne. Bravely, upon these texts, Wicksell built even greater and more insightful edifices. Long after Wicksell had gone before the Lords of Valhalla to argue his innovative ideas about money circulation, capital-structure and..um..turning convents into profit-maximizing ventures, his visionary legacy proceeded in the hands of his remarkably able students - Myrdal, Lindahl, Ohlin, Lundberg and more. Sadly, these youngsters were nonetheless ignored by most rotten English dogs and indeed, the whole country suddenly disappeared from the economist's atlas - until, years later, some of these students and their friends in high places decided to create a memorial prize to remind the world that Sweden was still there. If only, dear reader, they could remind us of how exciting and innovative it once was as well! The Olympians too were not eliminated altogether by the inquisitional bands of Marshallian Hussars. Some Olympians - such as Sraffa, Kalecki and Leontief - lived on secretly, ocassionally interacting with the new regime, at other times just living as hermits, safely hidden from the mortal professional scythe of Neoclassicism. There, they continued to clandestinely measure things in quarters of corn, bales of wheat and tons of iron, and would deliberately forget to add utility-based demand functions to their big systems of equations. Around their hermitage, they told us, diamonds were not scarcer than water - they were simply costlier to produce. Another group of Olympians disguised themselves as their old enemies (the Titan ""Historicists"") and called themselves Institutionalists. But these also lived a famished existence in small communities scattered over the barbarian wastelands of America and Germany. Some concluded that as long as they were allowed to work in peace on their tasks (hammering mountains of figures into solidly-crafted business cycles, for instance), they would not seek to provoke the wrath of the new regime. But others, drunk with lustful rebelliousness, as the one named Veblen, heeded not the danger. Disregarding their precarious position, they laughed at and spat upon the boots of the Royal Hussars and their ""revolution"". But the latter branded these brave souls as insane heretics and mercilessly burnt them and their works in a radiant but terrible ""Auto da Fé"". For many years did the land of the Econ, where rarely even a derivative was to be found, thus remain. Your storyteller must sadly report, gentle reader, that this was a time of great silence and boredom indeed - and little but pestilence and inanity is bred in the bosom of boredom. Neoclassical banality followed absurdity, to be exposed only by the occasional symposiums provoked by troublemakers such as the god-in-exile, Sraffa, and a particular woman of imperfect repute. But despite their apparent absolute power, the Bourbon kings of Cambridge should not have thought themselves so comfortable. A great migration was soon to upset the partial equilibrium they had set up. For lo, upon the horizon, scores of de-laureled mathematicians and economists that had been locked in isolation in Vienna and other areas of Europe fled from brutally real Prussian oppression during the 1930s and made their way to London and the United States - making these lands havens of stirring dissident activity. And what a change, oh dear reader of this strange tale, was to be wrought upon the land of Econ! This human wave of unfortunates yielded forth a shining and formidable tidal wave reminiscent of the earlier revolutionary fervor of 1871. In America, the foreign anarchists and their young American allies braved royalist bullets at the barricades in the streets of Chicago, set up the Cowles Commune - and the coals of the Revolution, long smoldering, were once again inflamed. Across the Atlantic, over the previously impervious shores of Albion, a similar group of infiltrators with funny-sounding names and rather suspicious habits emerged and took over the L.S.E. and began to infect the English journals with their unquarantined continental theories. The few red-blooded Anglo-Saxons that remained in these places, such as the young John Hicks, had nonetheless read so much German, Italian, Mathematics and Swedish that they no longer spoke English and had probably also lost some of their native virtues (such as Marshallian ""common sense""). So too, it is has been correspondingly revealed, of the even younger American squire, Paul Samuelson. Oh, Economidae, restrain the language of this humble storyteller who does not merit the favor of your reasoned truth. He wishes to sing with tongue inflamed of the grand concepts and dreams of General Equilibrium Theory, of the fires ignited by the Hungarian princes, John von Neumann and Abraham Wald, and fuelled by the beautiful constructions of the grand master sculptors - Kenneth Arrow, Gerard Debreu, Lionel McKenzie and so many others - that raged through London and America. But this unworthy storyteller shall restrain himself for he is drunk on the aesthetic beauty of axiomatic precision. Still, noble reader, he must go on and report the times and verily he will attempt it. The times indeed were revolutionary. Subversive portraits of Walras, Pareto and Wicksteed were hung in lecture halls while the royalist objective supply-siders were strung up by the neck on the boulevards of incoherence. Pamphlets and monographs full of linear homogenous functions were printed by the Cowles Commune and spread about the world. The mathematical tricolor, after almost seventy years of neglect, was once again hung from the windows of universities and institutions everywhere. Exiles came from as far as France, Japan and Israel to the new Walrasian heaven, placed the fixpointed liberty cap on top of a separating hyperplane and danced the kakutani around it. Rolling up their sleeves and whistling the Lausannaise, they set themselves to work building the new utopia, the saddlepoint of harmony, the land of General Equilibrium. But the peculiar success of the Cowles Communists and their friends at the L.S.E. was overshadowed by a highly important palace coup in the royal capital. The charismatic Marshallian general, John Maynard Keynes, organized a tight-knit circus of renegade young officers from the elite Cambridge barracks. Urged on by an entire population impoverished by so many years of the royalist-induced depression, General Keynes and his circus were overcome by a sudden propensity to act: letting their animal spirits take over, their coup was quickly carried through under the shadows of night. General Keynes overthrew and beheaded King Marshall's weak son and heir, Prince Pigou. The royal ministers were quickly converted into their service, acknowledging indeed the truth that was contained in the General's Theory. The monarchy was abolished and replaced with a republic - with citizen Keynes himself as Lord Protector of the Commonwealth. Oh, honorable reader, let this unworthy goatherder and storyteller remind you that the republic was challenged from the first day - but vainly! Sir Dennis, forced to save the old regime, came galloping out to face the Lord Protector - but Keynes pilloried him straight back to his wonderland. A lonely Viking drakkar stormed the shores - claiming the land was owned by them ex ante. But, after a financial arrangement, they soon set sail back to Sweden (it is still unknown whether they survived the return journey). All over the country, speedily but with some difficulty, the pockets of defiance that still remained were held in check or overwhelmed altogether. The Keynesian republic was in place. Hounded by the Walrasians out of Micro and expunged from Macro by the Keynesians, the royalists lived on a meager existence in the slums of Chicago and Manchester. Many years passed and the strange victorious duomvir of Keynesians and Walrasians persisted unabated. A tense modus vivendi had apparently been arranged between these two groups and a rapproachment was even spoken of by some young idealists. Still, the world prospered and continued steadily, and so no clash seemed imminent. Yet there were always the exceptions. The mad baron Friedrich von Hayek, indisposed towards all rulers, whether Olympian, royalist or republican, fled to the Alpine lands, where perched atop Mount Pelerin, he would sing sad dirges to the moon and delirious elegies to the dawn. He was but a specimen of that singular group of ungrouped men that would emerge in this period - such Frank the Black Knight, Schumpeter the Sage, the sorceror Maurice Allais, the noble Sir Kenneth of Boulder, the heathen warriors Al-Schackle, Ibn-Scitovsky and El-Schelling and, lest we forget, the ever-suffering Saint Georgescu of Roegen. Like the mad baron Hayek, each of their caps, it seemed, wore a folly of a different color. During these times, the solitary haunting wails of these lonely souls would also be heard - but faintly, for the stability of the duomvir was being assiduously maintained and protected. Yet, many years later, on a murky morning - and oh, dear reader, it was to be a dark day indeed - two footloose barbarian knights made their way down from the frosty North with savagery in their eyes and plagues in their scabbards. These pagan knights, Clower the Constrained and Axel the Lionheaded, proceeded to the duomvir and brazenly accused the Walrasians of irrelevance and their Keynesian brides of faithlessness. The entire land held its breath: surely, this dishonorable insult could not stand unanswered! Finally, the Frankish Emperor Edmond, whom had been trained in the visionary arts by the passionate sorcerer Maurice and apprenticed at the Cowles Commune, took up the barbarians' gauntlet. Brave Edmond set forth with his Paladins to meet the challengers. The brave Paladins, which included Benassy of Gaul, Drèze of the Belgians and the nimble Jean-Michel of the Grand Mountain, were only partly effective and returned with all manners of temporary treaties and constrained boons. However, your storyteller must note that among the brave Paladins was a knight as wily as Ganelon of old - who, later seduced by net wealth, was to become known as Barro the Traitor. Still, the barbarians had provoked the Keynesians and Walrasians to finally confront one another and settle their differences through some rationing process. Alas, there was an ensuing failure in coordination and the stability of the duomvir system was endangered. In the meantime, there were other troubles outside the gates. From the royalist nest of counter-revolutionaries in Chicago, occasional monetarist cocktails were cast at the institutions of the new Keynesian republic. These caused tremors in public opinion but failed to restore the fallen Marshallian monarchy. Nonetheless, the tumult sealed the name of one royalist firebrand, Bonnie Prince Friedman, in the popular lore and newspapers of the hinterlands. Still, mounted regiments of the New England Cuirassiers swept about the land to engage and contain these royalist terrorists. The Cuirassiers, among whom we count the famous Colonels Tobin, Samuelson, Solow and Modigliani, fancied themselves defenders of the Keynesian republic, and thus were often compared to the ""Roundheads"" of yore. But they were also called ""Bastards"" by others - therefore we shall take the convex combination of these two terms and henceforth label them ""Blockheads"". Despite their successes against rebellious royalist pockets, the Blockheads suffered substantial losses in two isolated but bloody encounters: the Battle of Causality and the Battle of Phillips' Curve. There, Bonnie Prince Friedman had mastered the ancient art of the Midwestern Charge - whereby the monarchist ranks, abandoning all sense of battlefield decorum, rigor, coherence and empirical evidence, with spine-chilling cries and taunts (the reputed oral tradition), waving natural battleaxes and fully employing their steady quantity of broad swords of gold, would rain down frenzied and wild upon the carefully-knit and rigorously built New England ranks. However impressively and coherently the defensive lines were arrayed by the brave Colonel Tobin and his lieutenants, the ferocity of the Midwestern Charge left many of the defenders reeling. But new things were astir elsewhere. Some of the veterans in the Keynesian army grumbled at the leniency of the rulers - arguing that the government the Lord Protector Keynes had installed was allowing for too much royalist influence. Why, they claimed, even the Blockheads seemed to be fraternizing with the very enemy they were supposed to pursue! The veterans, Rosa Robinson, Karl Kaldor and a small group of other radicals, inspired by the subversive pamphlets of some old Olympian god-in-exile, attempted a Sraffacist putsch in the heart of the Keynesian Capital. The revolt was directed at the mercenary regiments of the Keynesian republic - royalists who had put on Keynesian colors and were now serving in Blockhead ranks. As the first shots were fired across the streets of Cambridge, the battle was enjoined. The elite of the Blockhead cavalry raced forth to engage the Sraffacists. But cannonballs of heterogeneous capital from behind the Sraffacist barricades scattered the Cuirassiers. Upon Colonel Samuelson's arrival, they regrouped and charged once more, but the blazing cannons manned by a Sraffacist corps of Italian mercenaries foiled the Blockheads once again. The Blockheads then tried a Trojan Horse approach - sending forth surrogate production functions against the barricade walls, but the Sraffacists were not fooled and sent it back covered in explosive jelly. For a while the War of the Cambridges seemed almost set to reverse the tide of history. The wearied Blockheads offered a truce, but prodded by their initial successes, the Sraffacists pushed on. In the meantime, from behind the Blockhead cavalry lines, a renegade regiment of the Pennsylvania Rifles led by Lieutenant Weintraub, split away from the main force and started firing from sniper posts on their old comrades. These sniper post Keynesians quickly signed a non-aggression pact with the Sraffacists and formed the ""Trieste Alliance"", dedicated to cleansing the republic of royalist infiltrators and preserve the ideals and memory of their beloved Lord Protector Keynes. But the Sraffacist revolt misfired for several reasons. For one, there was constant bickering among different groups within the camp - especially among the two largest factions at the heart of the Trieste Alliance: the American Post Keynesians and the Cambridge Sraffacists. Two other related sects which had joined the fray - the armed monks of the Holy Order of Marxius and zealous pastors of the Church of Commons and Latter-Day Institutionalists - also had agendas of their own. Secondly, or so they argued, politics and numbers were against them: the Blockheads apparently used their influence in the republican parliament to bar the members of the Trieste Alliance from preaching on street-corners and lecture halls. Thirdly, in the heat of the battle, the Sraffacists took hold of some peaceful Walrasian civilians (whom they mistook as royalists) and tried to set fire to their humble communal homes. Alas, with the assistance of the renegade Cantabrigian, Frank Hahn, the Walrasians stood not idly by while their edifices burned unjustly: they struck back by charging the Cambridge stronghold waving torches burning with intertemporal fires and vectors of heterogeneous bullets. Perhaps the major cause of the failure of the Sraffacist revolt was that it was quickly overshadowed by another - an Eighteenth de Brumaire by the royalists. The Keynesian regime had became tired and heavy with old tenured mandarins - and thus the inevitable corruption and inefficiency which always accompanies this spread like a pestilence. The Paladin challenges, the unceasing monarchist terrorism, and the Cambridge Wars had begun to stretch the resources and resilience of its defenders. To crown their ill- fortunes, Saracen buccaneers, aboard petrol tankers, had taken to raiding the treasuries of the local princes, leaving inflation and unemployment in their wake. The populace, which was already distrustful of the reliability of the Blockheads, grew impatient. In the royalist ghetto of Chicago, perceiving the strains and weaknesses in Blockhead ranks, the young Marquis de Lucas came up with a brilliant plot which would put an end to the Keynesian regime. Surreptitiously disguised as Walrasians (whom, it must be recalled, the Blockheads tolerated), a royalist band led by the Marquis made its way into the republican parliament and blew up a ton of RE gunpowder. The old Keynesian delegates were not all instantly killed, but they lay there wounded and dying. Quickly enough, the Marquis de Lucas suspended the Keynesian Constitution and crowned himself Emperor of the Macro. He handwrote another constitution and proclaimed the dawn of a new classical age to the confused populace. They nonetheless elected their representative agents to a new parliament and all generations, old and young, were sworn to obedience. Even those of the loyal opposition who presumably would seek to maintain the policies of the old regime, the so-called ""New Keynesian Party"", swore to theorize according to the new Lucasian Code. With the old Keynesians killed, the Trieste Alliance scattered, the Northern barbarians and the Paladins safely exiled in the duchies of Ucla, Belgium and France, the Imperial Lucasian regime seemed almost unchallengeable. It reigned for many years, buttressed by the commissioning of numerous new public engineering projects (under the Royal Business Cycle agency set up in the early 1980s) which employed many idle and bright youngsters eager to demonstrate their quantitative skills. It is true that the old Walrasian commune was quick to take arms against the usurpers. But the Walrasians did not have the heart or energy to pursue this more effectively. In the early 1970s, after the Stability Scandal and the embarrassing Sonnenschein Affair, the commune began dissipating as its members realized that their utopian ideals could not be fulfilled. The early successful days of their Existential Proof and the Core Project were now over and few among them could foresee any more promising avenues. Some Walrasian fire was still generated during the Great Leap to Finiteness in the middle of the decade - not to be confused with the earlier Great Leap to Infiniteness or the later Great Leap to Incompleteness (it can be noticed, noble reader, that Cowles Communists, loyal to their revolutionary temperaments, tend to do things in discrete leaps). But the halcyon days were over. The slogans embroidered on the mathematical tricolor, ""Objective, Constraint, Equilibrium"", had proved to be an illusion and, purists as they were, the commune was gradually disbanded. What the new Imperial regime did not notice (and certainly did not anticipate), however, was the slow gathering of the impending clouds of doom. After the disbanding of the Walrasian communes, some of its more puritanical members had gone underground and formed a secret society, the Nash Liberation Front. These, in turn, were joined underground by old dissidents and disaffected members of the new parliament who had grown tired of the edicts of the Emperor's junta. Several of these secret societies were given cover by foreign powers, such as Biology, Mathematics and Psychology, and some of the rebel groups had even set up guerilla camps in their lands. Under the very nose of the Imperial Guards, a Grand Armee of dissidents was being assembled and preparations for an invasion of the Lucasian Empire were being made. Oh, virtuous reader, your humble storyteller has indeed seen the Grand Armee! Once, when wandering lost through the dark, strange Land of Journals, his faithful goats beside him grazing along those rocky pastures, his Walrasian heart sad, his Keynesian bones exhausted and his Olympian eyes much diminished, he decided to rest upon a hill and await the lifting of the evening mist. And when it arose, what a spectacle unfolded! Your storyteller swears upon all the gods and more that all that is to follow, bar some demon's interference, is what he verily saw. He spotted a valley wherein were arrayed hundreds of armed men, encamped, sharpening their swords and pikes and cleaning their muskets. Like the great army assembled by Gustavus Adolphus of old in the plains of Saxony, many different flags flew everywhere over the camp of the Grand Armee - and, to the immense joy of this old spirit, they were all tinged with mathematical colors. And institutions and structures - realistic structures - were imprinted on their sabres. And from their eyes blazed forth the fire of determination, a determination to save their discipline from the cold grip of Imperial rot. Their demeanour was brave, as if to announce unto the world ""no more unforgivable assumptions, no more shoddy reasoning, no more ambiguity and ideological quibbling!"" But, ah, patient reader of this story, it may seem that your weak storyteller has let his imagination take his senses prisoner. Let him then merely make his report truthfully and soberly of what he saw in the valley. There were men and women of all lands, speaking many different tongues, arranged by banner colors into separate corners of the camp. This reserve army of the disaffected seems to have been gathered and arranged into battalions and regiments - of which your storyteller read some of the names emblazoned on their banners: Non-linearists, Bounded Rationalists, Evolutionarists, Complexians, Sunspotistes, Post Keynesians, New and Old Institutionalists and a rascally group of eclectic adventurers calling themselves the Post-Walrasians. Then there were the massive Game Theory battalions and their elite regiment of dragoons, the Evolutionary Game Theorists. And there were many others, whose banners were undecipherable but are sure to emerge forth in time. What a beautiful sight to behold! A hundred flowers blooming forth in this hidden Bohemian valley! More importantly, gracious reader, when the excitement engendered by the impact of the initial vision wore down, your storyteller noticed there was a strange fragrance that lurked in the camp, a sweetness that danced above the pungent air filled with cannon smoke and gun ash: it was the scent of a purpose, a new revolution, a smell which reminded your old storyteller of the one of 1871 - to rebuild economics from the ground up, but with newer concepts, axioms and more realistic assumptions and structures. There stood the Grand Armee of tomorrow! Armed with biological weapons, psychological weapons and ('tis rumored) even nuclear weapons given to them by foreign powers, they have been practicing for the invasion of the mainland in conference camps everywhere from Stockholm to Santa Fe. Indeed, some have already mobilized and made deep inroads. The Game Theory battalions, for instance, have reportedly acquired a beachhead and swept some areas (such as Industrial Organization) clean of imperial troops. Massive technological improvements in the legionnaire's weaponry, notably in computational power, has only accelerated their advance. The nimble cavalries of Evolutionary Game Theorists and Bounded Rationalists have moved far ahead and are already holding the citadels of agent-based, rationality and uncertainty theories under siege. Others, such as the Non-Linearists have concentrated on a terrorist campaign - infiltrating highly-populated areas such as the ostentatious palaces which house the Royal Business Cycle agency and detonating high-explosive non-linear devices in the middle of their hallways, causing immense damage and confusion (this is particularly troubling since the time-consuming and grant-gobbling calibration efforts of the Imperial Engineers of the RBC are extremely delicate and sensitive to such sabotage). Still, your intoxicated storyteller felt a slight twinge in his heart from whence emerged a dark realization: the main thing lacking in this Grand Armee is the philosopher and general, Gustavus Adolphus himself - the fire-breathing visionary who can identify the single uniting concept and set up the research program accordingly. The straightforward aim of ""overthrowing the rot"" is simply not enough. As the sad experience of the Trieste Alliance testifies, the objective has to be couched in positive terms of a conceptual revolution - as opposed to the negative one of irreducible ""anti-Imperialism"". Nor is this anti-Imperialist sentiment necessarily uniform across this band of armed men and women: indeed 'tis known that, like Wallenstein of old, some of the elite of the Court, such as the Sargent of the Imperial Guards, are fraternizing with the rebel army and may even lead their own troops into the ranks of the Grand Armee. Why, it is even whispered that Emperor Lucas himself desires to approach them to negotiate terms of surrender! In the end, then gentle reader, there may be no outright revolution of the caliber or depth of that of 1871 - although there is the hint of one certainly in the air. And the possibility lies there too: dissatisfaction runs deep and the invading forces already in place are not going to retreat any time soon. Yet it is not inconceivable that perhaps the non-linearists will run out of bombs, or the complexists might blow themselves up while tinkering with their stockpile of biological weaponry, and perhaps the slivers of Keynesians left will perish in the eternal exile of anchorite puritanism. And, of course, above all, there is still that great possibility that the intermittent clashes within the ranks of the Grand Armee ascend to take on the form of permanent fissures. No Gustavus Adolphus has emerged yet, so the field is open to all aspiring lieutenants. But a Gustavus Adolphus might never arise. Or, worse yet, he might come as an usurper, as Marshall did in 1890, to drag the discipline into the dungeons of incoherence and irrelevance for yet another century. So your tired storyteller must end this saga with a word of caution. Perhaps at this point we should lay down our aspirations for a grand system and allow each of the battalions to roam independently for a while, proceeding on their own, examining each other in passing, learning from each other, each taking what is useful to their particular research program and leaving behind what is not. In time, if the gods are kind, there might be some convergence on some principles and possibly even a few conclusions, so that thereupon the discipline may be a bit more honest and maybe even helpful to humanity at large. But if there is not such a convergence, let us not take arms and violently charge each other in the name of ideological purity - for then we might slaughter and bury much of what is insightful and useful. Let us then listen, reflect critically, and proceed with caution. Nonetheless, we need not rashly dismiss the dream outright. It is not unthinkable that a new conceptual revolution with the ferocity and thoroughness of the 1871 one could yet happen...and perhaps even sooner than we might expect. Thus ends the Walrasiad. Farewell, dear reader, this exhausted storyteller must bid his leave. May the Economidae then continue to inspire our travels and investigations in this peculiar discipline and grant us the necessary wisdom to distinguish when our ideas are heading in the right direction and when they are in the wrong. In short, may ye be at least as wise as the goats I tend.  __________________________     All rights reserved, Gonçalo L. Fonseca",https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/essays/walrasiad.htm
