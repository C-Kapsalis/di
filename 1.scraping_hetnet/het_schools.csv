The Ancients,"    The ""Ancients"", in a European context, refers to the philosophers and scientists of the civilizations of Ancient Greece and (to a lesser extent) Rome. .The earliest civilizations in Greece - the so-called ""Minoan"" in Crete and Mycenean"" on the Greek mainland - emerged around 2200 and 1600 BCE respectively, but fell by 1200, part of the general Bronze Age collapse of the ancient world.  Greece remained enveloped in a ""dark age"" period for the next four centuries, roughly from 1200 to 800 BCE.  The civilization of ancient Greece proper refers to the numerous city-states (polis) that emerged in the course of the 8th Century BCE.   The early period (roughly 8th-6th C.) is normally referred to as the ""Archaic period"", to be followed by the ""Classical period"" (5th-4th C.) of Greek civilization. The accoutrements of Greek civilization started not on mainland Greece, but in the Greek colonies on the Ionian coast of Asia Minor in the late 6th C., then a crossroads of multiple civilizations.  Ionian merchants traveled from the Black Sea to the Levant to Egypt, their craftsmen helped build Persepolis in the heart of Persia, and their soldiers served as mercenaries served as far afield as Tartessos in Spain.   And they would return home, with very expanded mental horizons and bubbling with new ideas. All these streams breached the old walls of archaic thinking.  The artistic accoutrements of Greek civilization - epic and lyric poetry, statuary, columned temples - began on the Ionian coast, in imitation of what they had seen abroad.  But it was in philosophy and science where the Ionians truly excelled, and pioneered the break from past modes of thinking at every level. They introduced logos to replace mythos,  explaining things by reason rather than myth, looking for causes behind things, rather than gods behind things.  Their philosophers introduced the distinction between knowledge and belief, and moved away from mythical concepts of space and time into something more extensive. In history, instead of a simplistic reduction of human history to two periods - ""the time of gods and heroes"" and then ""the present"" - there is instead a rather steady sequence of pasts, steadily feeding into the next. Similarly their geographies and peripluses showed it was not simply ""us and the gods"", but ""us, them, some others, some further away, and those still further away, etc.""  Their trade begat the first coins, initially minted in the inland entrepot city of Sardis (Lydia), which would soon be copied by other Greek cities.  With coinage came borrowing and lending, debt slavery and inequality and some of the earliest attempts at addressing economic problems with government policy. The beginning of the ""Classical Age"" proper is commonly dated roughly around 509, with the institutionalization of hoplite democracy in Athens, the establishment of the Peloponnesian League by Sparta and, coincidentally, the foundation of the Roman Republic. The ensuing century saw the rise of the city-state of Athens as a commercial and maritime superpower, establishing a hegemonic empire over the Aegean Sea, reaching its height under Pericles in the 450s, and ending in the defeat of the Athenians in 404, at the end of the Peloponnesian Wars.   The collapse of Athenian power was followed by a few decades of hegemony by Sparta, ending in 371 with the ascension of Thebes (Boeotia).  This lasted only briefly until the kings of Macedonia, initially Philip II, then his son Alexander the Great, effectively annexed the old city-sates of Greece into their massive empire.  The Macedonian empire spread the influence of Hellenic civilization, including coinage and economics, through the Mediterranean and Middle East. The trial and death of Socrates, a peripatetic Athenian philosopher, in 399, opened a new chapter in classical Greek philosophy.  His students, Xenophon and Plato, set down his ideas in writing. and Plato's student Aristotle, pushed the envelope further.  Aristotle would go on to serve as tutor of Alexander.  The study of the economic ideas is found mostly in Aristotle and Xenophon, with minor contributions by other writers.   The fragmentation of the Macedonian empire coincided with the rise of the Rome, which by 280s was master of Italy, and after a long series of Punic Wars against its rival Carthage, was in control of of an empire over the western Mediterranean by 146. A near-simultaneous series of eastern wars had led to the Roman annexation of Macedonia in 148.  They would go on to conquer the rest of Greece, Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine and Egypt in the next century.   In 27 BCE, the Roman Republic gave way to a dictatorial empire under Augustus, and would remain in imperial format for the next four to five centuries.  Culturally, Romans adopted the Hellenic civilization wholesale and although they had great writers of their own, they often preferred to recycle the great thinkers of classical Greece.  The greatest change was the spread and adoption of Christianity in the 4th Century, coming about a century before the western (Latin) empire finally collapsed in 476.  While western (Latin) Europe descended into the Dark Ages in the 5th-6th C., the doctrines of the classical philosophy were resurrected by Islamic scholars.  It was through them that the 13th and 14th Century Scholastic theologians recovered classical Greek works, and brought their thinking (notably Aristotle) back into the mainstream of European intellectual life.

Islamic Economics," In the centuries between the fall of Rome to the European renaissance, one of the leading political, cultural and economic powers in the region was arguably the Islamic Caliphate and its successor states.  As such, the scholars of the Islamic world had much to say about economics -- primarily from a juristic standpoint, but also from an analytical one. What is commonly termed ""Islamic economics"" today refers effectively to this.   The Birth of the Islamic Caliphate (632-661) The calendar of the Islamic world marks the foundation of Islam in 622 CE, the year of the migration (hijrah) from Mecca to Medina of the fledgling community of Muslims led by the Prophet Muhammad.  But for historians, a more significant date is probably 632, the year of Muhammad's death and the election of Abu Bakr as his successor (Caliph), formally ""Commander of the Faithful"" (amir al-mu'minin).  As Abu Bakr was not directly appointed by the Prophet, and possessed no religious authority of his own,  many Arab tribal leaders felt little reason to transfer their political loyalties to him.  As such, the disparate coalition of Arabs which had formed the early community of Muslims (the ummah, in Arab parlance) began fragmenting.  Tribe and after tribe seceded and went on their own way, many of them resuming to their pre-Islamic beliefs and traditions.  There was a great likelihood that Islam would not survive the death of its charismatic Prophet.  It is to the political and organizational genius of the early Caliphs, then, that Islam owes its preservation.   One of the first tasks was to organize the compilation of the Holy Qur'an, hitherto held orally, believed to be the word of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by the archangel Gabriel. This became the central document of the new religion.  The Caliph also deployed the remnant of the Muslim army and whatever political authority he had left to bring the Arab coalition back together ('wars of the ridda').  In the course of this, the recovering Muslims came up against the Arab tribes of the northern frontier, clients of the Byzantine and Persian empires.  The enthusiastic energy of the Muslim commanders quickly turned what should have been routine border incursions into an out-and-out invasion of the ageing empires.  By 641, in the space of a less than ten years,  the bulk of the Persian empire and the Byzantine provinces of Syria, Palestine and Egypt were in Muslim hands.   Abu Bakr had died before the end of the first campaigns, and it fell to his successor, the Caliph Omar, to begin integrating these massive territories into a single political unit -- often called the Islamic empire or Caliphate.  The first problem of any empire is to restore law and order, and Omar had to improvise quickly. As it happened, the ethics of Islam (e.g. protection of the weak, the prohibition of fraud, etc.) were compatible with the underlying principles of the various legal traditions found within their empire (Roman, Arab, Jewish, etc.)  This made the job of the early Islamic judges (qadi) easier: if a local law did not contradict the Qur'an, it could stand.  On the economic front, the Islamic empire was inaugurated with a massive (if somewhat inadvertent) land reform program.  The Bedouin Arabs who did the bulk of the early conquering were nomads.  They were not interested in land and so did not ""replace"" the local pre-Islamic lords that they had deposed or killed in battle, but went off in search of more tangible booty.  As such, local peasants were often left to their own devices, and had to organize production, harvesting and storage by themselves.  Town and village councils sprouted up spontaneously for the purpose. So, in many areas of the Caliphate,  the new subject populations were instantaneously liberated from age-old serfdom and acquired an unheard of degree of political autonomy and economic empowerment.  For their part, the Caliphs were happy to see this happen, as it not only secured the loyalty of the conquered peoples, but it also gave them a ready-made system of local administration.  The new ownership tenures were ratified by appealing to the Muslim principle that anybody who works on abandoned land, after a certain period of time, automatically takes private possession of it.  ""He who revives dead land, owns it"", the Caliph Omar declared, quoting the Prophet himself.  But this was by no means uniform.  Sedentary Muslims in the armies, were quite keen to appropriate and settle down on conquered land.  However, their material aspirations were put to an end early on by the remarkable decision by Caliph Omar prohibiting any further redistribution and/or purchase of conquered lands by the Muslim conquerors.  This decision to protect local peasant-proprietorship in conquered lands was partly guided by fiscal concerns.  By Islamic law, Muslims are tax-exempt.  More precisely, zakat, the only tax Muslims paid, was already earmarked for the care of the poor.  As a result, the revenues necessary for the running of the empire itself had to be drawn from the payment of jizyah (poll-taxes) and kharaj (land-taxes) by non-Muslims (Dhimmis).  It is for this reason that the Caliphs were keenly interested in protecting the property and maintaining the economic well-being of non-Muslims within the empire. But Omar's decision of outright prohibition was too controversial. After some conflict, a compromise was reached.  Outright seizures of conquered land were prohibited, but purchases were allowed.  The ushr, a tithe on Muslim ""seizures and acquisitions"" (i.e. all Muslim-owned property outside the Arabian peninsula), was introduced to partly replace the lost revenues.  But this fiscal regime had several unanticipated side-effects.  In the first place, it prompted a massive wave of conversions to Islam.  Every conversion meant lost tax revenue -- and so we find, time and again, the paradoxical scene of Caliphal authorities discouraging further conversions to Islam.  It is indicative of the significance of non-Muslim taxes that Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians -- admittedly second-class citizens within the empire -- were nonetheless treated better and given more protections than tax-exempt Muslims of heterodox sects (Kharijites, Shi'ites, etc.)  The Umayyad Caliphate (661-750) In 656, the fourth caliph, Othman, was assassinated.  A period of civil war followed as various parties vied for succession, ending in 661 with the deposition of the fifth Caliph Ali and the ascension of Caliph Mu'awiya, leader of the Umayyad clan.  Ali's partisans, the Shi'ites, staged a rebellion in 680 in an effort to restore Ali's line, but were defeated once again.  This was followed up in 683 by a second civil war that nearly broke the empire in pieces.. The Umayyad Caliphs -- particularly Caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685-705) -- reunited and centralized the Caliphate in the aftermath.  To prevent the empire unraveling again, they overhauled its central institutional features.  They transformed it from a quasi-democratic ""community of Muslims"", into an autocratic state, ruled from its new capital in Damascus (Syria) via a set of interlocking aristocratic assemblies, or Shura (council of tribal leaders and provincial governors).  The caliph's seat itself was declared hereditary in the Umayyad family -- thereby introducing the dynastic principle for the Islamic empire.   The Umayyads restarted the process of expansion in 670, quickly capturing Byzantine North Africa (Ifriqiya) and, with more difficulty, the Berber kingdoms of the western Maghreb.  The conquest and absorption of the Berbers was completed only in 710.  In 712, an Arab-Berber army invaded Spain, conquering the peninsula from the Christian Visigoths in a short seven years.  That same year, an Arab-Persian army went east, conquering western India.  But Muslim expansion petered out shortly after that. A renewed Muslim assault on Byzantium ended at the walls of Constantinople in 719. The Muslim thrust into western Europe was halted by the Franks at Tours in 733 and into Asia at Samarkand in 751.  The frontiers of the Islamic Empire were subsequently stabilized at the Pyrenees in the west and the Punjab in the east, with pockets elsewhere. In the subsequent century, itinerant traders and missionaries would spread the faith further into Central Asia, East Africa and Southeast Asia while sea-borne Muslim adventurers from Spain and Africa seized control of the western Mediterranean islands and established enclaves in France and Italy. If the first Muslim conquests had been more-or-less ""accidental"", driven by the almost-independent initiative of individual Arab generals, the later conquests had been a bit more deliberate.   The Islamic empire was a cash state, dependent on tax revenues rather than demesne lands to function. Its armies also operated on a cash basis, depending on private markets for their supplies, paid out of regimental treasuries.  As such, many military campaigns had little more than fiscal goals in mind - an opportunity to plunder, collect tribute and replenish the treasuries.   From around 696, under Caliph Abd al-Malik, the Umayyads began minting their own gold coins (dinars), silver coins (dirhams) and copper tokens (flus). But the second wave of campaigns had not paid for itself.  The string of Muslim reverses, particularly at  Constantinople, had been expensive.  And as the frontiers stabilized, revenues from captured loot evaporated.  As the treasuries thinned, the Umayyad lords of Damascus instructed their provincial governors to dynamize local fiscal revenues.  This meant sending out tax-collectors to lean on local populations, whether Muslim or non-Muslim, and exacting new taxes and dues, even if they contradicted Islamic strictures.  As early as 685, the Umayyads declared that non-Arab Muslims (Mawalis) would pay the same taxes (kharaj and jizyah) as non-Muslims. In some areas, forced labor was introduced (the Qur'an explicitly forbids the enslaving of Muslims).  As a result, Berber and Persian converts to Islam, who had fought in the campaigns, felt particularly aggrieved. Contravening Islamic practice, the division of booty, the assignment of duties, pay and benefits, were very different for Arab and non-Arab soldiers.  Predictably, the Mawalis resented their relegation to second-class citizenship. Tax revolts and mutinies broke out in various locations, stretching Umayyad finances further and prompting the introduction of even more oppressive measures.  These exactions had become particularly routine in the caliphates of al-Walid (705-715) and Sulayman (715-17), and had driven the Mawalis to exasperation.  But in 718, the Umayyad caliph Umar II finally forbade the levying of extraordinary taxation and dues from non-Arab Muslims, thereby defusing much of the tension. But the expensive military reverses in the 720s and 730s had forced caliphal authorities to look for innovative ways to replenish their treasuries. During the caliphate of Hisham from 724, the prohibitions were sidestepped with re-interpretations, e.g. tying the hkaraj  to the land itself, rather than to religion of their owners, so that lands that were at any point subject to the kharaj remained under kharaj even if currently owned by a Muslim.  . In practice, all they really intended to do was to raise the ushr tax to the higher kharaj level.  But the legal device they used to accomplish this was very controversial. What they did was prohibit any further transfers of land ownership from non-Muslims to Muslims; Muslims could only lease these lands in long or perpetual leases, and so, because their owners were nominally non-Muslim, the lands were still subject to the high kharaj tax (whose burden would fall on the tillers).  This was certainly the wrong way to go about it. The legal device explicitly interfered in religiously-sanctioned freedoms of private property ownership and transfer. As resentments mounted, non-Arab Muslims (Mawalis) grew receptive to heterodox religious activists.  Many flocked to the Shi'ites, hoping to replace the Umayyyad caliphs with a ""better"" bloodline. But the Shi'ites were under microscopic surveillance by the Umayyad authorities. Others rallied behind those numerous messianic figures (Mahdis), self-proclaimed divine justicers, that kept popping up everywhere -- but they were ineffectual and disappeared just as quickly.  But there was another group that seemed to offer a a more permanent solution: the Kharijites.  The Kharijites preached a puritan form of Islam, promising a new political order, where all Muslims would be equal, irrespective of ethnicity or tribal status, and Islamic law would be strictly adhered to. Unlike the Shi'ites or the Mahdis, who promised only to replace one ruler with another, the Kharijites promised a new constitution.  The preaching of Kharijite activists fell on the receptive ears of non-Arab Muslims. The original Kharijites had been a radical group of Ali's followers  who had emerged in the 650s and proclaimed that laws are to be decided by God, not man.  Initially, they simply meant that they wanted ""trial by ordeal"" instituted -- so the Caliph should be decided upon in battle  (""God gives victory to the chosen""), not by the political agreement of tribal chieftains.  When no ""battle test"" was available, the Kharijites insisted that, at the very least, the Caliph must be a pious and upright Muslim, strictly observing all Islamic commandments.  They used this argument to legitimize assassinations of rival claimants to the Caliphate (including the ill-fated Ali) during the early civil wars. Those pretenders,  the Kharijites claimed, were impious and motivated by human ambition and thus unfit to rule.  They got even more radical in the early Umayyad reign.  The true test of an upright Caliph, the Kharijites now claimed, was not merely his personal conduct but also the extent to which the laws he institutes are strictly according to Qur'anic recommendations.  ""Enjoining the Good, Forbidding the Bad"" became the Kharijites rallying cry. :The Kharijites introduced the novel political notion that the Islamic empire should be a nomocracy (rule of law) and not an autocracy (rule of a man) or even a democracy (rule of men). Ranged against them were the Murj'ites, the ""liberals"" of the era.  Why translate all Islamic ethics and commandments into the law of the land, they asked?  If religious principles are a matter of personal conscience and divine justice, than what business is it of  human legislators and judges?  Not that that gives them the right to ride roughshod over basic human sensibilities (which may be informed by Islamic ethics), but, at their root, laws are a secular human affair, the prerogative of Caliph.  If you want to ensure accountability and curb abuses of power, then fiddle with the composition and powers of the assemblies (Shura). This debate over the nature of law -- secular or religious -- was the central battle in the more urgent struggle over the political future of the Caliphate.   The Kharijites echoed the feelings of many in the Muslim community who feared that the Umayyad dynasty, with the connivance of the Shura, was preparing to transform the Islamic Caliphate into a secular autocracy under themselves. Certainly, that is what many of the mistreated Mawalis came to perceive.  The choice  seemed to be self-evident.  If law was secular, as the Murj'ites advocated, then the source of law would be the Caliphs themselves.  If law was sacred, as the Kharijites insisted, then by the Islamic legal principle of ijma (""consensus""), the source of law would be in the hands the entire Muslim community.  Thus, the Kharijites -- those wild-eyed, violent, intolerant radicals of yore -- can be regarded as the spearhead of a democratic impulse against incipient tyranny, while the liberal Murj'ites were the apologists of authoritarianism.. The original Kharijites had been destroyed and dispersed by Umayyad military campaigns in the 690s, but their message continued to resonate and new Kharijite-type sects, like the Sufrites and the Ibadites, emerged here and there.  It helped that the new Kharijites had largely abandoned the murderous tactics of their predecessors and that respectable scholar-jurists had taken up the nomocratic doctrines and made them more sophisticated.  Kharijite preachers penetrated population centers and garrisons in the various corners of the caliphate. For non-Arab Muslims in particular, the new Kharijite doctrines were especially appealing , promising to establish the rule of law, a law which granted all Muslims full and equal rights.   The Revolt of Islam (750) All this came to a head in 740s.  In the west, fired up Kharijite preachers, the Berbers revolted against the Arab aristocracy.  In the east, around 747, the Persian general, Abu Muslim, forged a disparate coalition of frustrated Muslim zealots (Kharijites, Shi'ites) and disaffected mawalis of various ethnicities (Persians, etc.) against the ruling Umayyads.  After a brief civil war, the coalition was victorious and the Umayyad clan massacred.  The rebels installed Abu al-Abbas (""as-Saffah"") as caliph, thereby inaugurating the Abbasid dynasty of the Caliphate.  The capital was immediately transferred to Kufa (Iraq), the old center of Muslim scholars and Kharijite activists. The Abbasid revolution was momentous.  The Caliphate was redesigned as a nomocracy, governed by Islamic law (Shari'a).  Theoretically, legislation was God-ordained.  But by the ""consensus"" principle (ijma) of exegesis, laws were now in the hands of the entire Muslim community (the ummah).  In practice, this was narrowed down to the community of scholar-jurists (the ulama).  They were to be the effective ""legislators"" of the Islamic Empire and, like any normal legislature, they were fragmented into ""parties"" or ""schools of thought"" (fiqh).   The formal head of the empire, the Caliph, was ""elected"" by the ulama and was regarded merely as the upholder of Shari'a.  He was the executor and ultimate judge, but never the source of law.  The Caliph may make one school of law ""official"", but that did not make adherents of other schools any less legitimate.   Through all sorts of ups and downs, this arrangement was to last well into the 19th Century.  The ulama never ""delivered"" the law back up to the Caliph.   Practically every ruler over the Muslims rested their power on their promise to uphold the sacred law.  Where the ruler did not comply, the ulama felt entitled to declare him ""illegitimate"" and lead the revolt against him (formally, a Caliph was ""deposed"" by having his name dropped from the Friday prayers).    The first task of statecraft in a new nomocracy is, obviously enough, the establishment of the legal code. The old practice of simply letting old laws stand except where they contradicted the Qur'an could no longer do. That expedient allowed immense differences in law and custom to persist across the Caliphate. A secular empire may be able to tolerate these differences; but a nomocracy cannot.   If the Caliphate is to rest entirely on the rule of law then, at the very least, that law has to be clear.      So the scholar-jurists set themselves to work constructing Shari'a.  Islamic judges (qadi) needed direction, but they had little to go upon.  Only a very small fraction of the recommendations in the Holy Qur'an gives anything amounting to specific legal guidance, the remainder being mostly general ethical principles.  So the initial phase of just reviewing current practices and checking them against the Qur'an only went so far.  The next step was to reconcile the differences between practices. The first attempts at reconciliation were more-or-less arbitrary and unsystematic -- drawing on his personal intuition (raya), the judge would just declare that this version was ""more correct"" than that one. But that was easy for other jurists to challenge, leading to endless quibbles.  So several prominent legal scholars attempted to lay down more systematic guidelines for legal construction where Qur'anic exegesis was not clear.  Two schools of thought on this had clearly emerged by the late 700s.  The Maliki (or Medina) School, founded by Malik ibn-Anas, emphasized recourse to ijmi or ""consensus"" of opinion among the Muslim community.  The Hanafi (or Kufa) School, founded by Abu-Hanifa, emphasized recourse to ijtihad or independent ""reasoning"".  Various forms of reasoning were recognized by the Hanafi school: qiyas (reasoning by analogy), istiham (juristic preference, i.e. accounting for specific circumstances, etc.), istislah (benefit to the community) and urf (custom).   To justify their decisions and methods of legal construction, the Hanafi and Maliki jurists often invoked the opinions and practices of early Caliphs, the close companions of the Prophet (the ashrab) and even the Prophet himself, to reinforce their own interpretations.  The opinions of the second caliph, Omar, were particularly useful for the Maliki school, while the Hanafi school found much inspiration in Ibn Masud (one of the Prophet's most respected companions).  But how reliable were these old opinions?  Nearly a century had intervened since the death of the last companion of the Prophet. A vast number of stories and anecdotes about the lives and opinions of the early Muslims had circulated orally since. Like a game of Chinese whispers, lots of inaccuracies were conveyed as well..   These stories often contradicted each other in different renderings.  Many were likely to be wholly false -- because the person who recorded them had a bad memory, or misheard them, or simply fabricated them outright.    As they searched for these early opinions, the scholar-jurists began writing them down, carefully recording the chain of oral transmission -- ""I heard x say that y said that z said ... "", always ending in a witness who was actually there physically.  The compiled records of the stated opinions and observed practices of the Prophet and his close companions became known as the ""Traditions"" (Sunna).  Strictly speaking, a hadith is merely an extract from the Sunna.  However, perhaps confusingly, these terms are also commonly used to distinguish words and actions, i.e. hadith are the stated opinions of the Prophet, sunna are the observed practices of the Prophet and his companions. .The Golden Age (750-850) Unlike the Arab-supremacist Umayyads before them, the Abbasid Caliphs were deliberately cosmopolitan -- indeed, perhaps too cosmopolitan.  Although they remained committed to the Shari'a project, they were quick to rid themselves of their old puritanical allies. Astonishingly, leaders of the radical sects which had brought them to power were shown the door and some (including the old champion, Abu Muslim) were executed. Seeking to get away from the eagle-eyed jurists of Kufa, the Caliph Abdullah (""al-Mansur"") erected a new capital in Baghdad and surrounded himself with ministers in a court which recalled more the splendor of the Sassanid kings of Persia than the puritan simplicity of Medina.  Baghdad quickly rose to become one of the largest and most splendorous cities in the world.  Al-Mansur's successors, particularly Caliph Haroun (""al-Rashid"") (r.786-809), Caliph Abdullah (""al-Ma'mun"") (r.819-33) and Caliph al-Mu'tasim (833-44), presided over what is widely-regarded as Islam's ""Golden Age"".  Keeping in mind the maxim attributed to the Prophet, ""Seek knowledge, even unto China"", the empire was scoured for every fragment of knowledge, useful or not, Muslim or heathen, that could be found.  Legions of scholars -- Muslim, Christian and Jewish -- were brought to Baghdad's ""House of Wisdom"" to sift through them.  Among many other things, the philosophical and scientific works of the Classical Greeks were dug out from obscurity and translated into Arabic.  It is needless to repeat here how medicine, astronomy, science, philosophy, mathematics, agriculture, crafts, engineering, etc. were revolutionized in the process and then re-transmitted to Europe.   But Islam itself was also revolutionized.  The most famous philosophers during the Golden Age were the Mu'tazilites, a school of theology founded by Wasil bin-Ata in Basra, which had drank deeply from the recently-translated classics.  The express purpose of the Mu'tazilite enterprise was to reinforce the pillars of the Muslim faith and Islamic Law with rationalist Greek logos.  This would not only ""strengthen"" faith itself, but it would also endow Islam with a respectable theology that would enable it to respond to Zoroastrian, Jewish and Christian critics who continued to doubt the solidity of the fledgling religion.  The Mu'tazilites stressed the primacy of reason over revelation.  God would not command of man that which would be absurd or unreasonable.  Consequently, good and evil could be known by all men through reason alone. However, because of human weakness, revelation was necessary to confirm to man what was truly good and to provide men with rules of behavior which unaided reason could not comprehend.   Nonetheless, the Mu'tazilites insisted, reason directs the understanding of revelation.  To reinforce their rationalist theology, the Mu'tazilites denounced the literal interpretations of the Qur'an.  They insisted that the Qur'an was a creation of God, and not the Word of God -- and like all of His creations, temporal and imperfect. As evidence, they pointed to the multiple attributes and anthropomorphic descriptions of God in the Qur'an -- which, interpreted literally, can lead down the slippery slope to polytheism.  The Mu'tazilites also stressed the the freedom of the human will, arguing that predestination was incompatible with Divine justice.  They made clever use of Aristotle's ""infinite regression"" paradox, developing a distinctly Platonic cosmology that argued that God ""created"" the world from an ""eternal matter"" with its own ""natural laws"".   The Mu'tazilites were celebrated during the Golden Age and showered with honors by the Abbasid Caliphs. The success of Mu'tazilites also helped the Hanafi legal school, which was perhaps closest to them in spirit.  The Mu'tazilites reached the apex of their influence with the ""inquisition"" (mihna) imposed by Caliph al-Ma'mun in 833, whereby all persons of rank -- including jurists -- were forced to make a public profession confirming the ""createdness"" of the Qur'an.  While often compared to the great Enlightenment figures of 18th C. Europe, the Mu'tazilites were seen in a much different light by their contemporaries.  The scholar-jurists, in particular, found their theories -- particularly the ""createdness"" of the Qur'an doctrine -- profoundly disturbing.  For if the Qur'an is ""imperfect"" and faith only understandable by ""reason"", then the implication is that the some men are better interpreters of the revelations than others.  Many immediately suspected the Mu'tazilites of attempting to establish an Islamic priesthood.  Was that their intention?  It is not unlikely..  Until the advent of Islam, a powerful priesthood had been central part of Persian society.  For the openly and unabashedly Persophile Abbasid court of Baghdad, the restoration of this privileged caste in some form or other would have been the ultimate act of nostalgia.   The Mu'tazilites, many of whom were of Persian origin themselves, rather enjoyed being fawned over by the Abbasid Caliphs and likely wouldn't have minded it.  But for the scholar-jurists of Kufa and elsewhere, the notion of an Islamic priesthood was anathema.  In 750, they had risked life and limb to overthrow the Umayyads and restore the law to the Muslim community.  Now the Mu'tazilites were trying to ""steal it back"" by denying the capacity -- and thus, implicitly, the right -- of the average man to interpret the Qur'an himself.  This could not be.  They did not throw out an autocracy merely to see it replaced by a theocracy (and not merely so, for a priesthood under the Caliph's thumb would indirectly deliver control of the law to him as well -- autocracy revisited).   The 833 mihna -- the Mu'tazilite inquisition about the ""createdness"" of the Qur'an -- was the last straw.  It is one thing to profess a philosophical doctrine, it is quite another to impose it, for then you are indeed acting in the capacity of a priest.  Legions of scholar-jurists, particularly of the Maliki school, refused to swear to it.  So did many government officials, particularly those of Arab extraction who resented the new Persian dominance.  Non-compliant jurists and officials were dismissed from their posts, barred from mosques, imprisoned and some even tortured and executed, by the Abbasid authorities.  The martyrdom of the few encouraged the opposition of the many.  As the tidal wave began to form, the Abbasids realized they had overstepped. The Sunni Revolution (850-900) The mihna was repealed soon after the ascension of the new Abbasid Caliph Mu'tawakkil in 847. The Mu'tazilites were scuttled out of court and a reaction against the excessive rationalism and Persophilia of the ""Golden Age"" was set in motion. It did not occur all of a sudden, but proceeded slowly over several decades.  What emerged from it is something known today as ""Sunni Islam"", the most widely practiced or orthodox version of Islam. The bards of the Sunni revolution was the Ash'arite school of theology, founded by the renegade philosopher, Ali al-Ash'ari, as a direct answer to the Mu'tazilities  Advocating the primacy of revelation over reason, the Ash'arites defended literal interpretation of the Qur'an.  They admitted that the Qur'an was material, given that it was revealed in a particular human language, at a particular time, in a particular location, etc.  However, they stopped short of admitting that it was a ""creation"" of God.  The Qur'an is still ""perfect"" and unequivocal, it is just the imperfection of human language that has caused the confusion and difficulties.  Reason can play a role in disentangling a truer understanding from the thickets of imperfect language, but literalness should never be abandoned, reason can never trump the Word.  The Ash'arites also reconciled predestination with Divine justice by distinguishing human will from human acts.  Invoking Neo-Platonist doctrines, they noted that the function of reason and language was to circumscribe and divide, thus God -- One and Absolute -- cannot be ""accessed"" by rational analysis and understanding, but rather only through extra-rational revelation and mystical experience - thus opening the way for Sufi practices.  But switching the Baghdad court's favorite philosophers does not a revolution make.  The main event occurred in the foundations of Islamic law.  This had nothing to do with the fancy logical acrobatics of theologians, but with a more gradual movement which was now gathering speed.  The movement stemmed from the groundbreaking 815 treatise of the jurist Muhammad al-Shafi'i, founder of the Shafi'ite School of legal thought.  Al-Shafi'i had grown increasingly uncomfortable with the great variations and inconsistencies in legal practice which the Malikite and Hanafite scholars had allowed to persist.  To fix this, al-Shafi'i insisted that there are only five sources of legal knowledge, and placed them in strict order of importance:    (1) the Holy Qur'an; 
(2) the Hadith (sayings attributed to the Prophet); 
(3) the Sunna (practices attributed to the Prophet and his close companions); 
(4) the ijma (consensus among religious authorities)
(5) qiyas (reasoning by analogy).   Notice that, contrary to the Hanafi, the Shafi'ites denied the legal validity of any form of reasoning other than reasoning by analogy.  And, against the Maliki, consensus is relegated to a lowly position on the list.  But that's not the important point.  The important point is that the Sunna are elevated to a position superior to either consensus or reasoning.   This would have tremendous consequences. At first glance, it may seem that all al-Shafi'i accomplished was the foundation of just another school of legal thought, barking in a cacophany of legal debate.  But in practice, Islamic law changed its nature completely.   Prior to al-Shafi'i, Islamic law had been a dynamic and progressive jurisprudence.  New decisions were made according to the most recent precedent and would, in turn, set the precedent for the next.  Al-Shafi'i's hierarchy of sources turned that around.  The most important precedent was not the latest, but the first, as found in the Sunna.  A single interpretation or decision by the Prophet himself or one of his companions automatically trumps all consensus and reasoning by the latest and brightest jurists.  This was core of the Sunni revolution.  Previously, Malikites and Hanafites might invoke the opinions of the Prophets and his companions to support their own opinion, but they were merely consulting them, not giving them authoritative primacy.  If the Prophet said one thing in the past, but consensus in the present says otherwise, than the latter is taken up.  The Prophet and his companions, however upright and wise, are just another group of men, after all, who lived in a different time and society anyway.  No longer. By al-Shafi'i's doctrine, the opinions of the Prophet and his companions, being closer to the divine origin, were consequently superior.  Their logic, their reasoning, their decisions and practices are more authoritative. Islamic law did not embrace the Shafi'ite school itself in any exclusive manner, but rather but rather al-Shafi'i's arguments about the primacy of the Sunna filtered to the other schools of jurisdprudence.  Their differences remained: the Maliki continued to emphasize consensus, the Hanafi the several types of reasoning.  But all schools, step-by-step, began to acknowledge the authoritative supremacy of the Sunna right after the Qur'an. This process was given a shot-in-the-arm by the labors of hadith scholars, such as al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud and others towards the late 800s.  They did not merely collect and record the hadith, but sifted through them, painstakingly reconciled and corrected the chains of transmission and evaluated and coded them by their degree of authenticity.  The Sunna, heretofore a disparate and incongruous collection, became systematic and readily-accessible to the jurists.  The availability of the Sunna, perhaps more than the arguments of al-Shafi'i, is what really persuaded the other schools to hop on board. Other schools of thought emerged during this time.   There were two further (and stricter) off-shoots of Shafi'itism: the Hanbali legal school (founded by Ahmad ibn-Hanbal) which further reduced the role of sources (4) and (5) and the Zahiri legal school (founded by Dawud ibn Khalaf) which insisted on strict literalism and eliminated (5) outright.   Another interesting outcome from the Shafi'ite revolution is that it gave the Shi'ites the impetus to embrace legalism.  The Shi'ites had been disappointed by the settlement of the 750 Abbasid revolution.  Their objective had been narrowly political: replacing the Umayyad caliph with the one from Ali's line. They were not particularly interested in Islamic law -- indeed, the Shari'a project seemed positively contrary to their cause: if legislation was God-ordained and in the hands of jurists, then it did not really matter who the Caliph was.  The Shafi'ite revolution changed all that, because it gave authoritative power to a few ""great men"" (i.e. the Prophet and his companions).  All the Shi'ites had to do was expand the list of great men to include their champions (they also struck out the first three Caliphs as usurpers).  So, the practices and opinions of the Shi'i Imams were compiled and a Shi'ite legal school was born.  The Shi'ites created a class of jurists of their own, talking in the same language and voicing similar principles as their Sunni counterparts, just drawing on a different set of traditions.  The fact that the Imam was still around, then there was a ""living"" source for the law, i.e. innovations could be introduced.  The ""occultation"" of the last Imam (which most Shi'ites believe happened in 872), didn't cramp their style.  The jurists just took on the oracular role of speaking on behalf of the ""hidden"" Imam.  The current legislative authority of Shi'ite jurists, an authority their Sunni counterparts never have had, was justified by the claim that they are still being inspired by the ""hidden"" Imam.  So, in a sense, the Shi'ite traditions are still a work-in-progress.    Philosophy vs. theology In the realm of theology, the scuttling of the Mu'tazalites in 849 did not put an end to rationalism or philosophy.  Hellenism was ingrained deep in the Islamic intellectual world, so there was a counter-reaction by several rationalist philosophers, like al-Kindi in the 9th Century, al-Farabi in the 10th, Ibn Sinna in the 11th and Ibn Rushd in the 12th.  Drawing upon Aristotle and with increasing sophistication, the rationalists sought to reconcile rationalist philosophy and revealed theology.  Their works were particularly influential on Scholastic Christian scholars like St. Thomas Aquinas, and Jewish theologians like Moses Maimonides. But the efforts of the Islamic rationalists were countered by Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali in the 11th Century.  Using Aristotelian arguments himself, al-Ghazali reiterated the Ash'arite position, stressing the primacy of revelation over reason, arguing that rationalist philosophy had nothing to say about matters of theology.   Al-Ghazali's sophisticated theology was embraced as the ""dogma"" of Sunni Islam.   The significance of al-Ghazali's doctrine on the intellectual development of the Muslim theology has been variously interpreted.  Some critics like to point out that by ""killing off"" the rationalists, al-Ghazali might have inadvertently stifled the continued development of science and philosophy in the Islamic academies.  But the actual effect of al-Ghazali's work was precisely the opposite, for by strictly separating science from religion, al-Ghazali liberated science from being a handmaiden to theology and allowed scientific inquiry to be pursued for its own sake.  Philosophical inquiry inside theology may have suffered, as the best minds in  Muslim theology no longer felt compelled to dig through classical philosophy or engage in rationalist calisthenics.  But scientific inquiry did not miss a beat - and the output of Muslim scientists continued unabated and even accelerated, their methods more comfortably rational and empirical than ever.  The scientific method could now take wing without worrying about stepping on theological toes. Much of the best scientific work of the Islamic world came after al-Ghazali, not before.  In that respect, to lament al-Ghazali's ""victory"" over theological rationalists like Ibn Rushd would be akin to regretting Sir Francis Bacon's ""victory"" over the equivalent Aristotlean Scholastics of his own time.       Fragmentation One of the vital legacies of the Sunni Revolution of the 850s was the dispensation of the caliph himself.  With the law now in the hands of the jurists, separated from temporal authorities, it did not matter much who the ruler was, or if Muslims were even under Muslim rulers at all.   From the 9th Century down to the modern era, Muslims have lived in a variety of states of all kinds of political stripes - many with rulers who reached the heights (or depths) of absolute despotism.  But the law was never delivered back into the hands of political rulers. There was nothing in Islamic philosophy that approached the idea of the ""divine right of kings"".  Jurists remained independent, and that independence was maintained even under the most ambitious of despots.  And it remained true in practice.  The outcome of legal cases involving private citizens versus government officials were not a foregone conclusion.  Nor cases involving men of different social rank, or even Muslims versus non-Muslims.  The rules of jurisprudence, the sources, were clearly set out and by and largely adhered to in the courts, regardless of political power or official favoritism. The irrelevance of rulers allowed for the fragmentation of the Islamic world into multiple political entities.  Already in the 750s, the Abbasids did not rule the entire Islamic world, but had to contend with break-away Muslim states on their peripheries - like the Umayyad emirate in Spain, Kharijite and Shi'ite states in the Maghreb, etc.  They were not only under independent rulers, many did not even acknowledge the Caliph in Baghdad as their notional caliph. The theory was tested perhaps most vigorously in the aftermath of the Mongol conquest of Baghdad in 1258.  This was not the first time Muslims had come under non-Muslim rule - it had happened before during the Spanish recoquista, the Crusader states of the Levant, etc. But the Mongols had put an end to the Abbasid caliphate.  The scholar-jurists of the Muslim world debated how to react.  Some, like Ibn Tamiya, preached the necessity of restoring the caliphate, and dusted off the doctrine of jihad or holy war, to expel the Mongol conquerors.  But the general consensus of the scholar-jurists was that the ruler was irrelevant, even non-Muslim ones, so long as they upheld or respected Islamic law in Muslim communities, it was the duty of Muslim subjects to remain loyal to the constituted political authorities, whatever their political, ethnic or religious characteristics may be. Islamic economics  The term ""Islamic economics"" has been given various meanings by different economists.  But by and large it refers to the legal aspects, specifically how Islamic law understands and implicates economic organization and practice. Commerce and Property In contrast to the Christian scholars, Islamic scholars were certainly less troubled by commerce and capitalism. The Prophet Mohammed, after all, had been a merchant and so were many of his early followers (Mecca was a major commercial center in the 7th Century). Thus, throughout the Sunna, we find continual references to private enterprise, profit and commerce.  The Holy Qur'an and the Hadith are peppered with statements in praise of merchants -- e.g. the Prophet is said to have said ""Merchants are the messengers of this world and God's faithful trustees on Earth"" and ""He who makes money pleases God"", etc.  Islam, unlike Christianity, did not have to grapple too much with the problems of church property, or square the contradictions between spiritual goals and material facts in religious institutions.   While some sects extolled the spiritual ideal of poverty, it never achieved the prominence that can be found in Christianity or Buddhism. Although poor preachers, holy men and Sufi ""saints"" were respected, and some even venerated, in local communities, Islam does not have a tradition of religious mendicants. Admittedly, there was a class of professional beggars, who justified themselves by scripture and were even incorporated into guilds in several Arab cities.  Although Islam stresses that God is the ultimate owner of all property (S. III.189), it recognizes the right of human ""trustees"" to dispose of it as if it were privately owned.  As detailed in the Sunna, private ownership was certainly the norm among the Prophet's followers.  The right to private ownership is not disputed among legal schools.  There were quibbles, however, about the details of transferring property (particularly inheritance).  Profit, too, was sanctioned.  Buying low and selling high was regarded as natural, not immoral.  Unlike their Christian counterparts, most Islamic scholars and jurists did not worry about ""just price"".  The ""just price"" is whatever price was deemed acceptable by traders.   There were restrictions, of course.  The merchant must conduct his trade honestly and he must not deal in impure goods (e.g. wine, pigs, etc.).  Common goods (e.g. water, grass) were given special protection.  Zakat, the duty of regular charity, was enforced and took a substantial bite out of profits.  Conspicuous consumption was discouraged (""Eat and drink: but waste not by excess for God loveth not the wasters"" (S.VII.31)) and periods of abstention (notably, the fasting month of Ramadan) were instituted as a reminder (""so that ye may learn self-restraint."" (S.II.183)).  The hoarding of wealth was deplored (""And there are those who bury gold and silver and spend it not in the way of God: announce unto them a most grievous penalty"" (S.IX.34)).  Speculation upon necessities, such as food, in times of great need, was frowned upon.  The prohibition of usury (riba) and dealing in uncertainty (gharar) -- which we shall return to momentarily -- naturally placed limits on the size and scope of commercial ventures.   Nonetheless, outside this relatively small set of reminders and restrictions, Islamic legal codes and authorities took a generally laissez-faire attitude on economic matters.   Crimes against property, such as theft, were subject to harrowing penalties.  Some scholars recognized the ""legitimacy"" of theft in cases of ""dire need"" (when, it must be assumed, zakat is not being properly collected and administered), but this was a minority opinion.   Theoretically, government appropriation was justified in the case of  ""misuse"" of private property (hijr).  An example of ""misuse"" is when property is hoarded or left unutilized.  The Prophet is said to have said that if land is left uncultivated or undeveloped for three years, the owner will cease to have any right to it, a principle enshrined by Caliph Omar's declaration (""he who revives dead land, owns it; but the demarcator has no right after three years"").  Also condemned are the use of property to harm others (e.g. building a dam on your land to deprive your neighbors of water) or to procure extra-economic benefits (e.g. political enfranchisement).  Profiteering is also considered ""misuse"".  The Prophet is said to have said: ""Whoever withholds cereals that they may become scarce and dear is a sinner.""   The ""misuse of property"" idea served as the basis of the Islamic condemnation of monopolistic practices.   This was particularly emphasized by the Hanbali jurists, Ibn Tamiya and Ibn al-Qayyim.  Although puritanical, they were also quite ""progressive"" in the sense of emphasizing that the State was responsible for social welfare.  They introduced the notion of the ""price of the equivalent"" -- which is the closest Islamic scholars dared come to the idea of ""just price"".   They discussed how how competition (and the lack of it) will draw actual market prices nearer to (or away) from it. Initially, the property of conquered peoples did not receive quite the same protection in the law, but once Omar, the second caliph, prohibited the distribution and purchase of conquered lands by Muslims, a new system was instituted whereby the property of non-Muslims were afforded full protection upon payment of jizyah and kharaj taxes.  The Prohibition of Usury The Islamic position on usury was no less complicated than the Christian one.  Scriptural exigency was clearer the Qur'an, e.g. ""Those who devour usury will not stand except as stands one whom the Evil One by his touch hath driven to madness.  That is because they say ""Trade is like usury,"" but God hath permitted trade and forbidden usury."" (S.II:275; see also S.II.278). So from the outset, it seems clear that Qur'an forbids usury.  But what is usury?  This is unclear and left unexplained.  The Arabic term, riba, means merely ""increase"" and early Islamic jurists had scant else to go on.  As a result, Islamic scholars have had to look to other legal sources for explanation, and an enormous body of scholarship has swirled around this.  Most of them focused on the following Hadith attributed to the Prophet: ""Exchange gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, similar to similar, hand to hand.  He who gives or takes more incurs riba, the giver and taker are equal (usurers)"".  In another narration, the following was added ""Should the kind of commodities differ, then exchange as you wish provided that the exchange is hand to hand.""   This Hadith has given the outline for the Islamic law on usury.  But the different schools of Islamic legal thought interpreted it differently. The Zahiri school, for instance, said that the ban on usury should only apply to the six commodities mentioned (the ribawi: gold, silver, wheat, barley, dates and salt); usury in all other commodities is permissible.  The Hanafi, Hanbali and Shi'a schools extended the ban on usury by analogy to all commodities which are measured by weight (like gold and silver) or volume (like wheat, salt, barley and dates).  So, items like beans and rice, measured by volume, would could under the usury ban, while cloth, measured by length, would be exempt.  The Shafi and Maliki schools extended the ban by analogy to all foodstuffs and excluded all non-foods (except the two mentioned metals) from the ban.  Curiously, all schools permitted usury in money that was made neither of gold nor silver (e.g. minor coins, like the copper flus, were exempt).   The ban on usury, may seem innocuous once we have limited the ban to a certain types of goods. But most financing occurred precisely in the form of these goods -- gold, silver, grain, etc. and so it put a large crimp on many things.   As long as the gold dinar and the silver dirham reigned over the Islamic world, this seemed a practicable resolution.  But when bills of exchange began circulating (as early as the 8th Century), the debate picked up once again.  Some said that dealing with bills was like dealing with interest-bearing debt and thus banned, while others insisted they dealt with the traded commodities, and thus whether interest was permissible was contingent on the commodity.  Some said that because they were ultimately backed by gold and silver, then the usury ban applied; others claimed that as they were made of paper, then they were like flus, a money of a different ""metal"", and thus exempt.   The issue of rent was a bit more complicated as it has features very similar to usury. In the strictest interpretation, a landlord cannot demand a ""fixed"" amount of crop or monetary payment as rent but only a share of the harvest or profits.  However, most jurists maintain that a fixed rent is acceptable if the landlord has contributed long-term improvements to the land, such as drainage, fencing, etc., in which case rent takes on the legal character of the landlord's ""wage"".  If a landlord makes no contributions to the land, however, scholars agree that he cannot demand a fixed rent. Of course, what is determined in theory has to be distinguished from what happens in practice.  Usury is prohibited in Shari'a outright, but, no matter how strict the school of thought, individual jurists are allowed to exercise discretion and thus, in practice, many exceptions slide by.  The penalties for riba (unlike other offenses, like drinking wine) are traditionally very light -- often a civil matter quickly and quietly resolved with a fine.  The disincentive was not very high.  Nonetheless, Muslim merchants and financiers developed a variety of financial arrangements to serve as an alternative to debt .  Acceptable forms of financing include the following: (1) musharaka (partnership): this is the simplest financing method.  Two (or more) people pool their resources in a joint venture, participate in its management and share the profits and losses on a pre-determined basis.  (2) mudarabah (silent partnership): also known as the Commenda in Europe, this form of financing operates as a kind of mutual fund.  One party puts up the capital, the other puts in the entrepreneurial skill.  The lender is entitled to a pre-determined share of the profits (and losses), but not a guaranteed return.  Some jurists argue for asymmetric distribution, i.e. the lender's share in case of profits is less than his share in case of losses.  The logic is that the entrepreneur's contribution of time and effort is already a sunk cost.  While musharka and mudarabah may be convenient financing methods for businesses, consumer loans cannot really be financed this way as there are no ""profits"" to be redistributed.  The following religiously-acceptable set of purchase/sale contracts are meant to replicate consumer loans: (3) murabaha (""cost-plus-profit"" financing): the financier acts as the purchasing agent for the borrower, and then sells the goods to the borrower with a fixed mark-up on the purchase price (e.g. a bank buys a house for ""itself"" and then sells it to the borrower with a 10% profit for its ""services"").  The borrower is allowed to defer payment.   (4) ijara wa iktina (hire-purchase, leasing) Instead of handing the home-buyer a mortgage, a bank ""enters"" into a partnership with a customer to jointly own a house.  For use of the portion of the house ""owned"" by the bank, the customer pays ""rent"" to the bank (i.e. pays interest) and, over time, ""buys out"" the bank's share (i.e. pays back principal).  Once again, this is virtually indistinguishable from an interest-bearing loan, except in the legal code. The banning of usury complicated, but did not end, debt finance.  There were always ways to ""create"" interest-bearing loan contracts.  The simplest is simply via ""delayment fees"".  For instance, in a murabaha contract, the financier could increase the mark-up the longer the deferment period (e.g. 1 month deferment means 11% mark-up, 2 months, 12% mark-up, etc.).  Alternatively, they could charge a high mark-up for a long period (e.g. 20% for one year) and then offer a discount for ""quick repayment"".   These delayment fees and speeding-up discounts effectively replicated interest, but their legal status is different.    The ""repurchase agreement"" (known both in the Christian and Muslim worlds as the mohatra contract) was the perhaps the most common dodge.  Agent A would sell agent B a worthless item (e.g. a candlestick) for 110 dinars payable in a year's time, and then immediately turn around and buy the candlestick back from agent B for 100 dinars in cash now.  In effect, agent A has just made a one-year loan to agent B at 10% interest -- but it looks like a pair of legitimate purchases and sales.  Of course, in the end, no good but gold exchanged hands and so a strict judge may be able to condemn it.  So a slight variation has agent A buy back something else (say, a matchbook) from agent B for 100 dinars and so there are two clearly separate transactions.  As the money has been exchanged for different goods, all we can detect is a price ratio between candlesticks a year hence and matchbooks now, no hint of usury is (legally) in sight.  The Hadith, recall, says that in trading one good for a different good, the price is whatever is decided upon by the traders.  No ""just price"" calculations come into play and if agent B wants to pay exorbitant amounts for candles and A overpay for matchbooks, so be it.    Another famous dodge is the contractum trinius, composed of three separate contracts: (1) agent A invests 100 dinars in agent B; (2) agent A sells agent B his right to any profit above, say 30 dinars, for a fee of 15 dinars; (3) For a fee of 5 dinars, B agrees to absorb all losses from the enterprise.  The net result is a 100 dinar loan from A to B with a fixed interest payment of 10 dinars.   Islamic jurists condemned these kinds of tricky practices and tried hard to provide workable definitions of usury to handle these dodges.  They carefully defined and condemned riba al-nasi'ah (interest on money lent), riba al-fadl (interest obtained via trading contracts) and riba al jahiliyyah (delayment fees).  However, not all schools or jurists agreed to their definitions.  Liberal judges, usually Hanafi, were often willing to let riba al-fadl to slip through. Some jurists went even further, arguing that the ban on interest should only apply to consumption loans, while productive loans were exempt.  The argument here was based on the historical ""fact"" that in the time of the Prophet, when usury was first banned, most loans were consumption loans.  Others argued that the prohibition only applies to excessive usury.   This argument is based on the Qur'anic verse  ""Oh ye who believe! Devour not usury, doubled and multiplied; But fear God; that ye may prosper."" (S.III.130).  However, the condemnation of usury is so vehement and unequivocal in the Hadith (the Prophet is said to have compared it to incest) that such a contention cannot stand. Gambling and Risk A few words must be given to the prohibition of gambling (gharar).  Medieval Islamic jurists expanded the definition of ""gambling"" beyond its scriptural confines to include trading wherever risk or uncertainty is involved.  This was done in response to Egyptian soldiers using their paychecks (drafts on local grain deposits) to speculate on the grain market at a time of great need.  Banning their speculative activity by calling it gharar, rather than on some other legal basis, was probably a mistake.  All things in life (especially commercial life) are uncertain. Nonetheless, the ban is technically in place, although many jurists (for good reason) have chosen to take its teeth out. The basis for the ban is the Prophet's disapproval, documented in the traditions, of certain types of transactions with uncertain outcomes.  These include the sale of unborn offspring of animals (existence is uncertain -- they may be stillborn), the advance sale of the fruit of a tree prior to ripening (the quantity of ripe fruit is uncertain), the sale where the outcome is based on the throw of a pebble (pure gambling) and the sale by a cloth vendor in which he does not give the buyer a proper opportunity to examine the cloth (trade is not transparent).   By analogy, waiters working for tips or salesmen working on commission are deemed to be engaged in gharar because one cannot predict  the volume of trade and thus the income that will be forthcoming.   The prohibition of gharar is more easily circumvented than that of usury since it only needs a more careful definition of the contract.  For instance, instead of hiring a hunter and pay him a fixed amount per rabbit caught (as yet unknown), hire him on the basis of the hours of labor he puts into catching rabbits (clear and well-defined).  Similarly, with waiters and salespeople who would otherwise rely on tips or commissions.  However, some jurists say that the ban only applies if the outcome of a particular enterprise is purely uncertain, in the sense that there is nothing systematic the entrepreneur can do to affect that outcome.  Because the number of rabbits caught, the satisfaction of customes or the number of sales is systematically dependent upon the efforts of the hunter, waiter and salesman respectively, then the outcome is not completely ""uncertain"" and thus not subject to the prohibition of gharar. Other jurists have stressed a stricter definition of gharar which is more in line with its ""gambling"" origins.  Ibn Taimiya for instance, noted that the main element of ""gambling"" is that who gains and who loses is purely dependent on chance.  When two people bet on a toss of a coin, one will win completely and the other lose completely.  If, however, the winner agrees to share his gains with the loser, then the bet is not, strictly speaking, gharar.   This stricter definition of gharar however still implicates many common activities, notably insurance.  Jurists claim that conventional insurance is gharar because when a claim is not made (as chance dictates), one party (the insurance company) acquires all the gains (the premium), while the other party (the insured) gets nothing.  In their view, conventional insurance contracts are pure gambles: the insurance company ""bets"" that I do not get sick while I bet that I get sick.  As an alternative vehicle, Islamic jurists recommend ""cooperative insurance"" (takaful), where the insurance company is, in effect, a ""community fund"".  Members of this ""community"" contribute premiums to indemnify any member of the community who experiences a specific loss.  The issue of forward contracts are trickier, since they inevitably involve uncertainty.  In the Hadith, the Prophet is said to have said ""Whoever buys cereals he shall not sell them until he obtains their possession"" and ""Bargain not about that which is not with you.""  This is obviously impracticable and the Sunna has numerous instances of forward contracts being undertaken by both merchants and farmers.  So, the prohibition has been given a narrower meaning.  Specifically, Islamic law allows salam contracts on commodities, where goods are paid for in advance, only their delivery is deferred.  The Hanafi school stresses that even though delivery is deferred in a salam contract, the goods must already be in existence somewhere; the other schools allow them to ""come into being"" in the interim period.  Commodity futures contracts where both payment and delivery of commodities are deferred to the future are expressly forbidden by all schools.  The exception to this is istisna, or a futures contract on manufactured goods.  Goods that need to be manufactured do not need to be paid in advance, nor is it necessary to determine a date of delivery. Public Finance Islamic law has imposed several constraints on the financing of government activity.  There are four sources of religiously-ordained revenues:  (1) Zakat, the duty of regular charity is one of the ""five pillars"" of Islam, as inseparable to the identity of a Muslim as regular prayer. In practice, it is a redistributive property tax.  Zakat is not optional.  Voluntary charity (sadaqah) is encouraged, but zakat is obligatory for all Muslims and backed, if need be, by the full force of the civil authorities.   Almost from its inception, zakat has been collected by the State on behalf of the poor.  It is a tax on property held for more than a year, assessed after deductions for living expenses.  The theological reasoning for zakat is not only to provide for the poor, but also to ""punish"" idle property and encourage it to be put into circulation. As with all such things, the legal schools were divided on what exactly is subject to zakat.  From the original sources, the consensus was that gold, silver and the profits of trade are taxed at 2.5% per annum.  Livestock is taxed at the same rate.  Agricultural and farming produce is taxed at 10%  p.a. if irrigated naturally by rain and by 20% p.a. if irrigated artificially.   The reasoning for this differential, based on a Hadith, is that artificial irrigation deprives others of a scarce resource (water in this case) and thus it is the responsibility of the depriver to compensate the community for it.  Mines and extracted natural resources are taxed at 20% for the same reason.  Zakat on modern property -- such as industrial machinery, dividends on stock, etc. -- is assessed by analogy. (2)  Jizyah is the poll tax paid by non-Muslim dhimmis (Jews and Christians) and commanded in the Qur'an (S.IX.29),.  Some have considered this a tax in order to ""punish"" dhimmis for failing to be steadfast in the true religion.  Others have taken it simply as the purchase of a ""right"" to live in a community of Muslims and have their persons, property and religious rituals protected by law, as well as to be exempt from military service.  In practice, the payment of jizyah, while higher than zakat, was not crushing.  Jizyah has the characteristics of a poll tax, in that the amount is owed is assessed per head, rather than per dinar of income. But it is not a uniform tax across all people.  For starters, there are classes of people - the very poor, women, the elderly, disabled, monks, etc. - that are entirely exempt from jizyah.  Moreover, even its assessment on free, able-bodied men was often qualified by income.   For instance, Amr ibn al-As, after conquering Egypt, set up a census to measure the population for the jizya, and thus the total expected jizya revenue for the whole province, but organized the actual collection by partitioning the population into wealth classes, so that the rich paid more and the poor less jizya of that total sum.   Elsewhere, it is reported customary to partition the population into three classes for jizyah collection, e.g. 48 dirhams for the rich, 24 for middle class and 12 for the poor. In many communities, the burden of jizyah often fell in practice on the wealthy alone, whom by solidarity or custom, assumed the payment of the jizyah for the poorer members of the community. Landlords paying the jizyah of his tenants was routine (often more expedient, and taken out of rents anyway). (3) Kharaj is the tax on the produce of lands conquered in the course of the expansion of Islam, but kept in the hands of non-Muslim tillers.  This was perhaps the major source of government revenue during the early Islamic Empire. (4) Ushr is a tithe on conquered lands held or bought by Muslims or previously uncultivated lands brought into cultivation by Muslims.  Today, ushr is charged for the use of State-owned lands.  (5) The Caliphal fifth. is a 20% tax on war spoils, that was instituted in the early days of the Islamic conquest, the rate mandated in the Qur'an  (S.8:41).  Initially earmarked for the maintenance of the Prophet's family, after the Prophet's death, it was re-directed by the early Caliphs for the central administration and armies of the Caliphate.  The Hanafi school argued the caliphal fifth extends to spoils discovered after the war is over, such as hidden treasure troves and (more significantly), it was extended by analogy to mining.  However, other schools (e.g. Shafi'ite, Hanabilite) regarded troves and mining as subject only to the conventional rates (e.g. zakat). Curiously, the prominence of Hanafi school in the west led to the institutionalization of the tax in Muslim states in Spain.  After the reconquista, the Christian states of Castile, Portugal, etc. adopted the tax themselves as the quinto real (""royal fifth"").  It became an important part of crown finance for the Iberian monarchies, and was extended to their overseas empires in the Americas, Africa and Asia. As zakat is earmarked for redistribution to the poor, the jizyah, kharaj and ushr were the only real sources of revenue for the government.  This led to the paradox that the greater the amount of conversions into Islam, the smaller the tax revenues (the ushr rate is lower than the kharaj rate).  For this reason, we find several instances in history when Caliphs tried to dissuade further conversions or forbid the transfer of property from non-Muslims to Muslims and even to just disregard the law and apply jizyah and kharaj taxes on certain segments of the Muslim population (see above for the historical account). To make up for this ""deficiency"" in tax base, some legal schools recognize that the state can ""sell"" its ""services"" and has the right to ""charge"" for them in the form of taxes, duties, etc.  However, whether it can compel such payments is a point of contention.  In principle, at least, ""trade"", even between State and citizen, must follow all the laws of commerce, e.g. it must be mutually agreed upon, transparent, no asymmetries in information, etc.  Monetary policy is implicated in this.  By outlawing gold-for-gold usury, seignorage was forbidden: as much gold must be given back as coins as is submitted in ingots (although scholars allow a fee to cover minting costs).  Many jurisst considered debasing currency is considered to be pure theft and fraud.  Government borrowing was also difficult, as interest could not be paid and, for most government activities, there is no clear ""profit"" to be shared. Of course, Muslim princes violated this repeatedly, or simply borrowed from non-Muslims.     Foreign Commerce The predisposition of Islam towards commerce extends, perhaps unsurprisingly, to foreign commerce as well.  While European princes were erecting all sorts of protective barriers to keep out long-distance trade and ""protect"" locals from the vicissitudes of the market, the princes of the Islamic kingdoms were bending over backwards to encourage foreign merchants to come trade and settle in their lands. As mentioned, the Prophet and many his early companions were merchants, and  7th C. Mecca was an important commercial entrepot for foreign trade, so there was from outset a decent respect, socially and in the law, for foreign trade, if not quite a theory of it. Even after trade routes changed, the Hajj, the obligatory pilgrimage to Mecca, brought Muslims together from the far-flung corners of the world, bringing with them information about different lands, resources and trading opportunities.  Foreign business deals and partnerships were often struck up between merchants on the pilgrimage. Arab merchants themselves extended trade (and their religion) well beyond the political boundaries, to India, Central Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia.  And that respect was extended to others - Armenians and Jews lived and traded virtually unhampered throughout the Muslim empires. The Arab historian and social philosopher, Ibn Khaldun (1377) was quick to point out the link between commercial enterprise, capital accumulation and the well-being of a kingdom. Khaldun warned princes of the ruinous long-term consequences of trying to interfere in the economic affairs and trade of private citizens.   By geographic happenstance, Muslim lands lay exactly on the trade routes between Europe, Africa and Asia and everybody knew that the fortunes of the state rose and fell with the volume of trade that passed through it.   As such, Muslim princes were not completely devoid of mercantilist instincts, and undertook various efforts to ensuring that trade routes passed through their territories rather than their rivals.  This sometimes meant wars to control ports and shipping lanes or making exclusive deals with specific groups of foreign traders, e.g. Mameluke sultanate of Egypt with the Venetian Republic, the Persian Il-Khanate with the Genoese, the Ottoman empire with the Levant Company, which often entailed freezing out other foreign competitors.

The Scholastics," The ""Scholastics"" refer to the 13th to 15th Century Christian scholars and theologians. Following the collapse of the western Roman Empire in 476, western Latin-speaking Europe had declined into the Dark Ages.  In 1086, the Christian conquerors of Toledo stumbled on a trove of lost books from the Ancient Greeks and their Arab commentators. The Corpus of Roman law was also recovered around this time. Universities soon began to pop up, as centers where scholars gathered to pore over these new old writings, and reconcile pagan wisdom with Christian teachings. Notable Scholastics like Thomas Aquinas revisited the dogma of the Catholic Church in light of the resurrection of the works of Greek philosophy, notably Aristotle, in the 13th C.

At the same time, Europe was beginning to crawl out of the Dark Ages. Trade was re-emerging, and with it came a new class of people - merchants, with fortunes - who seemed to have no assigned place in the traditional feudal order. The Medieval Scholastics deployed their new knowledge to try to make sense of this strange new world of markets and money.  Scholastics pored over questions of just price in exchange, usury, role of merchants, inequality, slavery,  etc.  Among the great scholastic economic questions was the issue of value - whether value is whatever society says it is  (Valor impositas), or whether things have intrinsic worth (Bonitas intrinsica).  Scholars like Aquinas opted for the former, but his great rival John Dun Scotus proposed value reflected cost of production. Later Scholastics, like Nicolas Oresme and Jean Buridan emphasized usefulness as the source of value. (See also our pages on the Ancients and Islamic Economics and Medieval universities.

The Salamanca School," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by University of Salamanca or any other organization. See the official University of Salamanca website] The University of Salamanca, one of the oldest universities in the world (founded c.1218, certainly before 1230 by the King of Leon), and the earliest extant in Spain. It was a prominent Dominican bastion in the late Scholastic period.  It was one of the homes of  Thomistic theology, even after the doctrines of St. Thomas Aquinas were disintegrating elsewhere in Europe first under the Scotist and Nominalist onslaughts, and then from the Reformation.   The ""School of Salamanca"" usually refers to the 16th C. legal, political and economic commentaries through a merging of Thomist theology and Humanist philosophy, to create a body of natural, international and economic law.  This approach was initiated by the leading figures of the university, notably Francisco de Vitoria in the 1530s.  The Salamanca school counted Domingo de Soto and  Navarrus as its most prominent theoreticians.  During the inflationary 16th century, theologians were appealed to repeatedly on economic affairs, particularly the status of contracts in those confusing economic times.  In an effort to lay down guidelines for commercial practice and focusing on practical notions of the public good, they moved away from past dogma and approached their questions in the spirit of natural law philosophy.  The result was reversal of centuries of Scholastic thinking on economic matters.  It was the Salamanca school that defined the just price as no more and no less than the naturally exchange-established price.  Their analysis led them to trace a scarcity theory of value and employed supply-and-demand with dexterity. They rejected Duns Scotus's ""cost of production"" conception of the just price, arguing that there was no objective way of determining price.    Before Bodin, but after Copernicus, Salamanca scholars independently uncovered the essential properties of the Quantity Theory of Money and used it to explain the general price inflation of the 1500s. They also providing a resounding defense of usury. It is common to associate early Jesuit philosophers like Leonard Lessius, Luis Molina, and Juan de Mariana, with the Salamanca school.  Although many Jesuit philosophers, notably Toledo, Suarez and de Lugo, passed through Salamanca and interacted with its scholars, their connection to that Dominican bastion was less tight and they can perhaps be set apart (some suggest calling them the 'Coimbra School', on account of Fonseca, Molina and Suarez, but that is also not quite right).  Nonetheless, the Jesuits reached many of the same conclusions on many economic doctrines and certainly both contributed to the transition between Scholastic and Natural Philosophy.  One may perhaps deduce a distinction between their approaches - the Dominicans of Salamanca, consulted so often by the government, had a practical eye on the smooth and proper functioning of the Spanish state and empire; the Jesuit commentators seemed to take a more theoretical approach, closer to social philosophy, an outcome of their underlying human-focused theology and a general urge to revise Catholic method away from traditional Dominican Scholasticism.  However, The Jesuit Order ('Society of Jesus'), founded in 1540 by St. Ignatius de Loyola, was erected to combat the appeal of Protestantism.  Against the Calvinist doctrine of predestination, the Jesuits had taken to emphasizing the importance of free human will (sometimes to the point where they were accused of resurrecting the 5th C. Pelagian heresy by their Dominican rivals, as happened to Lessius in 1588 and Molina in 1597).   The Jesuit emphasis on the human will translated into a more wide-ranging political and economic philosophy that stressed the human role (to the exclusion of divine providence) in all manner of things and thus brought it closer to a natural philosophy approach.  The Scholastic doctrine of 'just price' was rejected out of hand as all-too-divine, the Jesuits arguing that value is a human affair and was determined by natural human interaction on markets.  They followed much the same line on money and inflation. On moral defenses of usury and profit, the Jesuits were eager to reform Catholic doctrine to bring it more in line with current practice, to ease their efforts to overcome the resistance of Protestant towns to re-catholicization. Quite more controversial was the Jesuit view of the basis of civil government, something the Salamanca scholars had largely and judiciously avoided.  In line with their general approach,  Jesuits like Molina, de Mariana and Suarez proposed that government rested on human consent rather than divine right.  This landed them in hot water with royal authorities.  Already resented as an ultramontanist agents (as the 'footsoldiers of the Pope', the Jesuits were not beholden to bishops, inquisitors or the national churches), Jesuit musings on the human rather than divine sources of government made them downright subversive to the established order.  It did not help matters that, notoriously, the Jesuit philosopher Juan de Mariana (1598) openly contemplated that the murder of a monach might be justified, if he proved tyrannical to the people.  This was uttered at a tense time of notorious political assassinations - Henry IV of France (attempted in 1595, succeeded in1610), James I of England (Gunpowder Plot, 1605), Paolo Sarpi of Venice (attempted, 1606), etc. - in which Jesuit activists were suspected of having a role (and may indeed have had one).  In the popular mindset of the time, the Jesuits became synonymous with regicide and political destabilization.   The Jesuits were temporarily expelled from France in 1595-1603, and were kept under watchful eye elsewhere, their subversive treatises frequently proscribed and burnt at public trial.  It was really only after the 1650s, when the Jesuits defeated the Jansenists (a French crypto-Calvinist Catholic sect, popular with parliaments and considered a threat to royal absolutism) in theological dispute, that the Jesuits earned their ticket into the royal courts of Europe and went from being regarded as nearly extra-statal terrorists to the reactionary upholders of royal power and the ancien regime.  [Although the old subversive 'regicide' label was resurrected by Enlightenment philosophers in the 1750s in an effort to dislodge the Jesuits from power and influence in the royal courts, a campaign orchestrated by the Marquis de Pombal, that ended up with the expulsion of the Jesuits from Portugal, Naples, Spain and France and the eventual reluctant suppression of the order by the Pope in 1773.]  Both the Salamanca scholars and the Jesuits had instrumental roles in the the easing of Church restrictions on markets, profits and, notably, the ban on usury.  The growth of commerce and capitalism in the 16th C. had led to the development of financial instruments which seemed to mock the old restrictions, and the popes had been roused to issue bulls condemning them. Pope Pius V's 1569 Cum Onus condemned personal annuities (quite common in Germany) as usurious, his 1571 In Eam condemned interest replicated in many businesses partnerships by the famous 'triple contract' (contractum trinius), while Pope Sixtus V's 1586 Detestabilis Avaritia condemned the interest implied by bank bills of exchange, a growing practice in intra-European commerce.  Nonetheless Salamanca scholars like De Soto and Navarrus and Jesuits like Lessius and Toledo, rushed to issue clarifications and commentaries that reduced the force of these bulls, found interpretations, exceptions and opened up loopholes which effectively legitimated the practices (althought their positions would not be formally reconciled with papal decrees until the 18th C.) The theoretical accomplishments of the Salamanca theorists and the early Jesuits in defense of markets have led some economists such as Friedrich von Hayek to suggest that, contrary to Max Weber's thesis, it is perhaps the religion of the Catholics and not the Calvinists, that set the grounds for capitalism.

The First Economists," The 16th Century was a century of transition in Europe.  Although common to summarize it as a ""Renaissance"", that is perhaps too rosy a monicker, given the travails it went through.   It is more apt to describe it as the passageway between the Medieval and the Modern age, and belonging strictly to neither.   Humanism and Reformation For Europe, the 16th Century began audaciously.  The short decade of the 1490s was a bewildering one.  The discovery of America by Christopher Columbus in 1492 and the opening of the sea route to India by Vasco da Gama in 1498 suddenly enlarged the physical boundaries of the Europe -- and, with it, the political, mental and spiritual boundaries of Europeans themselves.   The Age of Discovery undermined the hitherto authoritative world views of the Ancient Greeks and Medieval Schoolmen.  Any child who had witnessed the marvels of America and Asia being unloaded on to the docks of Lisbon and Cadiz would find the classical pronouncements on geography, zoology, botany, etc. laughable.  And so the scholars wondered: if the Ancients and the Scholastics had been so completely wrong about the physical universe, what else might they have been wrong about?  And so, in the early 1500s, a spirit of intellectual liberty and iconoclasm swept through the schools of Europe.  It was initially driven by Humanist scholars.  The Humanists had emerged in late 15th C. Italy, and soon spread to northern Europe, notably the Low Countries.  The original impetus was the rediscovery of a new wave of lost works from classical antiquity that flooded the west after the fall of Constantinople in 1453.  This broke the Medieval dependence on Aristotle, allowing them to embrace a wider variety of sources of classical knowledge.  No longer bound to narrow Scholastic pedantry and dogmatic ""certainties"", the Humanists began to appeal to a merger of reason and religious morality, rather than depend on authority and tradition, as the guide to doctrine. With their exquisite Latin and sharp satire, they reduced old icons and doctrines into objects of derision.  The emergence of the printing press in southern Germany, which was set up in every major European city by the end of the 15th C., allowed them to communicate quickly and efficiently, and helped forge a pan-European intellectual elite.  The Humanists promoted classical education, particularly in philosophy, literature and history,  particularly among ruling elite, believing it would lead to a revival of public virtue and social harmony.   The early Humanists dreamt boldly and optimistically of a new European order for the new century. They naively believed that once the blinders of stifling dogma were lifted and reason allowed full reign, wars and strife would also come to an end.  The ascension of the young Hapsburg Emperor Charles V in 1519 seemed to offer a practical opportunity to their flights of fancy. The diligent work of his grandfathers had paid off handsomely and Charles V inherited an empire which included much of Europe - Spain, the Low Countries,  Italy, Germany as well as the known Americas. Many Humanists saw in Charles V the best chance yet for the political unification of Europe, the benign ""universal monarchy"" which would end war and disorderly strife and facilitate Europe's transition into a rational, virtuous utopia.   But already in the 1520s, the Humanist dream began to unravel before political realities.  France had only just escaped extinction and dismemberment in the ferocious feudal chaos of the previous century and was emerging as a new unified power.  The ambitious Valois monarch was not about to succumb quietly to the universalist aspirations of a bright-eyed Hapsburg teenager.  In 1521, war broke out between France and the Hapsburg Empire which would rage, on and off, for much of the remainder of the century. Just as political unity and peace was escaping from their grasp, hope for rational doctrinal reform was shocked by the arrival of the Reformation.  The Humanists' iconoclasm had paved the way for Martin Luther.  And while many Humanists were sympathetic to the 95 theses Luther nailed to the door at Wittenberg on that fateful day in 1517, Luther was not one of their own.   The Humanists aimed at doctrinal conciliation through reason, hoping for reform from above, by influencing the minds of the ruling classes and scholars of Europe in their witty, erudite Latin.  But the fiery Luther spoke of confrontation and certainty in his blunt, peasant German.  Luther's  stubborn stance -- ""Here I stand; I can do no other"" -- despaired the Humanists.  As the schism in western Christendom took shape,  the Humanist dream of a rational, universal church was turned to ashes by the torches of intolerance, sectarianism and dogmatic strife. By 1555, the Emperor was exhausted and Germany was divided and delivered to its princes.  The Valois-Hapsburg hostilities were suspended by Cateau-Cambresis (1559).  But now it was France's turn to be enveloped in religious chaos. Calvinism, a more radical form of Reformed Christianity, centered at Geneva since the 1540s, had been spreading deeply throughout France.  In the 1560s, a tripartite civil war ripped France apart - the Calvinist Huguenots demanded religious tolerance, the ultras of the Catholic League demanded nothing short of an inquisition while a middle faction of politiques attempted to navigate between them and desperately keep France stitched together.  As the religious militias took to each other's throats, the crown of France tumbled nearly into irrelevance. The resolution - the Edict of Nantes in 1598 - bought an uneasy peace.  The French crown was delivered to the House of Bourbon,  and the great citadels of the west and south of France were left in the hands of the Huguenots, a precarious state-within-a-state.  Now France too was divided. The Reformation had a substantial impact on European attitudes.    However, the two main protagonists of the Reformation, Luther and Calvin, had different ideas on economic matters.  Martin Luther, on the advice of the logician Philipp Melancthon, did not depart much from the old Scholastic positions.  For instance Luther agreed to the ban on usury and condemned monopolistic practices, financial speculation, importation of luxury goods, etc. with even more verve than the Scholastics had done.  Given the end of Ecclesiastical authorities, Luther insisted that secular authorities step in to enforce these rules, a call for intervention which was may have encouraged later Mercantilism.  His promotion of ""political communities"" may further explain its nationalistic flavor. In contrast, John Calvin's impact was less associated with Mercantilism and more with the capitalist age which followed it.  Calvin's theology had no room for nationalism or the State, both of which were seen as subordinate to religious authority.  Unlike Luther, Calvin was willing to drop the Scholastic economic doctrines entirely.  He was a critic of the traditional ban on usury, arguing that as long as it was not excessive, it was entirely acceptable.   Several commentators (notably, Max Weber and R.H. Tawney) have given great relevance to relationship between capitalism and the ""Protestant ethic"".   Their claim, in effect, is that Calvinist dogma ""excused"" and even ""encouraged"" (directly or indirectly) private acquisitiveness and accumulation.  Of course, the mercantile-minded Renaissance princes, many of them Catholics, did not need to subscribe to the doctrines of Luther or Calvin, to justify themselves.  Their Machiavellian outlook and demeanors sufficed. Rise of Antwerp The 16th century claimed two other significant casualties - the great commercial empires of the Venetian Republic in the Mediterranean and the Hanseatic League in the North and Baltic Seas. There is little doubt that the 1400s had belonged to Venice.  In the course of that century, her ancient and deadly rival, Genoa, fell on hard times, while Venice had gone from strength to strength.  Through the markets of Alexandria, Venice had exclusive access to African gold and Asian spices. While the rest of Europe was suffering a precious metal drought and debasing their currencies in a hurry, Venice alone could maintain the purity of her gold ducat.  Venice used these riches to go adventuring in Italy, nabbing great chunks of the Italian mainland, whether through hired mercenary armies, or as foreclosures on her loans.  But Venice's fortunes changed quickly by the turn of the century.  In 1498, the Portuguese captain Vasco da Gama swung around the Cape of Good Hope, opening up an alternative direct sea route to India.  In a few short years,  the Portuguese quickly seized control of the Indian Ocean lanes and severed Venice's old routes to Asian trade.  As if this was not enough, the Genoese came roaring back into the picture, placing their financing, trade networks  and expertise at Portugal's disposal.  The Genoese helped set up Antwerp as a keystone of a new, rival commercial complex.  Portuguese spice ships returning from Asia would forward their cargo to Antwerp, to be sold throughout northern Europe.  Silver from the new mines of Tyrol and Bohemia, in Venice's backyard, so necessary for the Asian spice trade, were redirected by Augsburg and Nuremberg merchants by river routes up to Antwerp, where it would be loaded onto Portuguese ships heading back to Asia.  In the opposite direction, African gold, carried by the Portuguese from the Akan goldfields of west Africa, poured into Antwerp in exchange for the German silver.    Just as the Venetian were attempting to come to grips with the new competition, they felt the weight of two military onslaughts. From the east, the rising Ottoman Turks, who had conquered Constantinople back in 1453, learned to sail and took to the sea.  Before the end of the century, the Ottomans had destroyed the Venetian navy and begun nabbing Venice's overseas possessions in the east Mediterranean.  This culminated in the Ottoman conquest of Mameluke Egypt and its all-important commercial port of Alexandria in 1516.  From the west, the crowned heads of Europe finally got their act together and began to fight back back against Venice's pretensions.  In the League of Cambrai, nearly all the major European powers combined to launch a joint offensive on the Most Serene Republic, seeking to dispossess the hated hyperpower of her mainland possessions.   Miraculously, Venice divided her enemies and survived another day. But she was never to be as powerful again. The new Portuguese-Genoese-Augsburg commercial complex, centered at Antwerp, dominated European commerce for much of the 16th century. But precious metal was a strain. The gold the Portuguese brought in from West Africa was never enough, and the Augsburg silver, however great, soon began running out.  To liberate precious metal for the Asian trade and finance the endless Hapsburg-Valois wars,  Italian and German merchants pioneered the use of correspondence trade and bills of exchange. By the mid-1550s, much of inter-European commerce was conducted by paper.  Parallel to this, the Hanseatic League, which had once enjoyed as dominant a monopoly in the north as Venice had had in the south, suffered a similar ignominious fate in the course of the 16th C.   The new Antwerp network side-stepped the old Hanseatic channels, and fostered the rise of non-Hanseatic merchants and fleets in the Low Countries.  The Hansa faced not only new competition, but a more technically advanced one as well.  The Hansa's old cogs were not as profitably designed as the new Dutch ships; unable to strike into open ocean, they missed out on the great Atlantic cod-fishing bonanza and overseas trade.  The Hansa were also slow to pick up on the credit  revolution pioneered on the continent.  As the Hansa struggled to compete, they were delivered a series of terrific political blows - their positions in the Baltics were upturned by an expansionary Muscovy,  the always-troublesome king of Denmark had grown more assertive,  and the monarchs of England, finding new sources of finance closer to home, began stripping the Hanseatic merchants of their privileges and, by 1597, had expelled them from England altogether. The age of Antwerp set in motion the transition of European commercial life from the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, and eventually from southern Europe to northern Europe, that would accelerate in the 17th Century The Golden Age of Spain The Hapsburg empire was divided in 1555 into Spanish and Austrian branches.  The Spanish branch got the lion's share, including the all-important Low Countries and wealthy Antwerp.  In 1580, the Spanish monarch stumbled on another piece of luck when the Portuguese dynasty expired and her Asian commercial empire fell into his lap.  With France crippled by civil war, the Spanish monarch Philip II, could concentrate on internal matters, hammering the once-disparate domains into a centrally-administered kingdom, and presiding over an age of Spanish imperial supremacy. For his centralizing efforts, Philip II of Spain relied on a growing state bureaucracy, the Holy Inquisition and a standing army in Flanders, three greatly expensive state institutions that, at any other time, would have been fiscally impossible to maintain.  The Spanish monarch needed gold, vast sums of it, to maintain them all.   The conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires in the 1520s and 1530s had given the Hapsburgs two great injections from the accumulated gold stocks of the American empires, topped off with a little gold panning in the West Indies, but that was all quickly spent.  The trickling from the Portuguese sources in west Africa were welcome, but insufficient for the needs of the Spanish crown. The real jackpot was the massive silver strikes in Zacatecas (Mexico) and above all, Potosi (Bolivia) in the mid-century.  Spanish treasure fleets were soon carrying mind-boggling volumes of silver into the ports of Cadiz and Seville.   The trick was now to turn that silver into the service of a state and army that insisted on being paid on gold.  The Augsburg bankers, the traditional financiers of the Hapsburgs, had been hobbled by the first Spanish state default of 1557.  But the Genoese had risen to replace them.  They erected an intricate money market network centered on three vertices - Antwerp, Besan√ßon (later Piacenza) and Medina del Campo.  There, they pioneered the development of asientos, Spanish state bonds, to be purchased by gold and redeemed in silver.  Silver shipments, touching Cadiz, would make their way to Genoa, where they were swapped for gold in the Italian markets, the silver shipped right back out to Asia, the gold carried overland along the ""Spanish Road"" to Antwerp. Once spent on Spanish garrisons in Flanders, the gold went back into circulation, so Genoese agents set about recovering it, deploying bills of exchange to clear any imbalance of payments and retain as much gold as possible within Hapsburg crown lands.   The Genoese-managed terpsichory kept Spanish state finances humming and enabled it to enjoy its ascendancy.  For their services, the Genoese financiers charged huge middlemen slices and exorbitant interest on bridging loans that pricked at the sensitivities of the Spanish Cortes.  It was this parliament that forced the Spanish crown into its second great default in 1575, in an effort to write out the Genoese.  But they soon learned their lesson - with Genoese financing suspended, the Spanish Army of Flanders went unpaid, and in 1576, went on a rampage, destroying nearly a third of the great city of Antwerp.  The sack of Antwerp drove people, merchants and business away from that great commercial city, north to the hitherto sleepy port of Amsterdam, opening a new chapter in the commercial and economic history of Europe. The Revolt of the Netherlands The centralizing tendencies of the Catholic monarchs of Spain put them at odds with local authorities.  So, it should be no surprise to find, already by the 1560s, the princes and statholders of the Low Countries trying to push back and reclaim their prerogatives. Mistakes were made, the argument soured, and soon the quarrel between the Spanish monarch and his renegade vassals in the Low Countries careened into all-out open revolt.   In 1579, led by Holland, seventeen provinces of the Calvinist-heavy north seceded from the Spanish-controlled and Catholic-heavy south and declared independence, forming the United Provinces of the Netherlands, a new country who's dizzying ascendancy and fortunes over the next century would be the envy of Europe. Queen Elizabeth of England's surreptitious support of the Dutch rebels brought the island-kingdom into conflict with the Spanish hyperpower.  In 1588, she narrowly escaped grievous punishment when the Great Spanish Armada met with disaster off the coast.  The individual heroics of England's fledgling pirate-captains, like Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh, zipping defiantly in-and-out of  her Atlantic ports and overseas colonies, mocked the might of the Spain.  Although little more than an irritation to Spain, the overseas adventures of English captains were more significant in changing English mentality. Traditionally, English policy had been focused on her lost dominions in continental France and her commerce had been abdicated into the hands of Italian and Hanseatic merchants.  Now England began entertaining the idea of looking westwards, and maybe going overseas herself.   Her adventurers had build her up a navy from scratch, her merchants had grown more confident. The Great Inflation Beyond the superstructure, there were two great underlying economic changes in western Europe: a population boom and the great inflation.  Since the Great Plague of the 1350s, the population of European countries had remained relatively flat - certainly in the countryside.  But this now began to change, and population growth began to pick up in the early 16th C. and would continue into the early decades of the next.   With greater population, came greater demand - for goods and land.  So it is unsurprising that, starting around the 1510s, the prices of commodities, notably consumer essentials like grain, also began a century-long secular rise.  Given that the flat or declining prices of the previous centuries, this is commonly called the ""price revolution"" or ""great inflation"" of the 16th C.  Parallel to this entered a new kind of farmer.  Wealthy urban merchants and manufacturers invested their accumulated  fortunes in land, hoping to capitalize on rising food prices and rents (and acquire the social status associated with landownership),   This  was particularly accentuated in northern Europe, where the Protestant Reformation brought a a lot of church-owned lands into the hands of the princes, who promptly sold them to the highest bidder to finance their wars.   But unlike the old gentry, with their paternalist noblesse oblige towards the peasantry, the nouveau riche brought their urban profit-seeking ethos along with them, treating their farms as just another business, ""factories of corn and beef"".  Ancient, tradition-bound rural relations between landlord and tenant, already strained by land scarcity, were upset as they were confronted with landlords prepared to enclose land and evict tenants to make way for sheep and other more profitable ventures.   As capitalist agriculture began to take root, small tenants were turned into wage laborers, adding to a labor supply already expanding with population growth, and kept wages flat despite rising prices.  Although poverty always existed,  the numbers and desperation of the poor increased greatly in scale in the 16th C.  Accentuating the problem, social institutions, like the rural commons and monasteries, which had long served as a safety net for the very poor, were beginning to disappear or had disappeared altogether, leaving many little option but to migrate, roaming the roads, looking desperately for work, begging as they went.  For many contemporaries, all this seemed to have appeared out of nowhere.   While the effects were visible --  the rising prices, the mass surge of beggars, etc., -- the causes were unknown.  Some dusted off old tried-and-true explanations that had occasionally served in the past,  but the sustained nature of  the new economic distress defied them.  And policy was nearly as lost - no matter how often they were whipped, the beggars simply did not disappear.    What we have called the ""first economists"" are the disparate collection of commentators of the 16th Century, who attempted to grapple with the new economic order, and come up with new explanations.  Most had little by way of guidance.  Unlike the Scholastics they were not bound by past writings or authority, but looked to facts as they could see them, and best explanations their wit could reckon. The first economists wracked their brains to discover its cause of the Great Inflation and how to bring it under control.    ""Commonwealth"" writers like John Hales, saw it in the new agrarian order.  Many blamed merchants who were ""deliberately"" withholding goods from the market (which many were, but usually after the inflation set in, in anticipation of higher future prices).  Others blamed foreign commerce, arguing that the export of commodities had created scarcities at home.  Others, observing rising land rents and interest rates, blamed capitalist landlords and unscrupulous bankers. Some looked to the monetary side of things.  The Sieur de Malestroict, for instance, suggested that if coins have less pure precious metal in them, their ""intrinsic value"" will decline relative to the prices of other goods. Hence, the recent inflation could be at least partly blamed on the debasement policies of European monarchs.  Where no debasement had occurred, then the falling precious metal content of coins must surely be due to a rise in illegal forgery and ""coin-clipping"" (the cutting off of the rough edges of minted coins).  Accordingly, the penalties meted out to anybody caught (or suspected) of these monetary crimes were among the most draconian on the books. However, from the 1550s onwards, a new idea began to take hold that it was not so much the intrinsic value of coins that had declined, but rather that the sheer quantity of coins had increased relative to the total supply of goods. This ""Quantity Theory of Money"" was first articulated by Nicholas Copernicus in 1526, but it only gained wider acceptance in the latter half of the century.  The Salamanca scholars such as Navarrus, the French jurist Jean Bodin and the Florentine banker Davanzati, were among the more ardent exponents of the Quantity Theory. For the Quantity Theorists, a rising supply of coins, regardless of the precise way by which it was increased, was the one cause behind all inflation.  They agreed that debasements and coin-clipping may cause inflation, not because they decrease the ""intrinsic value"" of coins, but rather because they cause more coins to be minted from a given stock of metal.  The Quantity Theorists, particularly Bodin, were keen to associate the surge in inflation in the 1550s and 1560s with the great flows of silver pouring into Spain from America after the discovery of the fabulous Potos√≠ silver mines of Peru.  However, we should note that the Great Inflation was already in place long before any large-scale mining began. For the ever-watchful Catholic church, inflation posed a second difficulty.  By reducing the value of debt, lenders were thereby forced to charge high levels of interest to compensate for the loss.  Although it seemed just that lenders should recover at least what they lent, it was still usury.  The debate over justum pretium (""just price"") was resurrected in Ecclesiastical ranks in an effort to clarify the appropriate commercial practice. The Spanish School of Salamanca led the way in the revision, arguing that the ""just price"" is exactly what the market decides it is and usury is no great sin. The 16th Century was a century of transition in Europe.  Although common to summarize it as a ""Renaissance"", that is perhaps too rosy a monicker, given the travails it went through.   It is more apt to describe it as the passageway between the Medieval and the Modern age, and belonging strictly to neither. It was a century that began with high hopes of universal peace, harmony, rationality and prosperity and ended with more war, more division, more intolerance and greater mass poverty than it began.  The modern world had indeed begun.  And so had economics.

The Mercantilists," 'Mercantilism' is an economic doctrine that prevailed in much of Europe during the 17th & 18th Centuries.  Mercantilism belongs to the 'prehistory' of economics, before it became a field of study. The doctrines of Mercantilism were articulated by a disparate collection of journalists, government officials, merchants and pamphleteers.  Their motivation to write on economic matters was motivated less by an effort to 'understand' how the economy works, and more to contribute to urgent policy discussions of the day.   Different countries, of course, face different challenges.  Given that they were addressing their national governments on national issues, mercantilist writing tends vary by country. Profession was also a factor. English Mercantilists were frequently private businessmen, who sought to influence government by public pamphleteering for or against some parliamentary act or other, in which they or their company had a vested interest.  As such, they operated and communicated somewhat differently from the courtiers and state officials of French Colbertisme or the comprehensive princely guidebooks of German Cameralism.  While there are some pan-European features which are common among Mercantilist writers, there was great variety and no two mercantilists really had the same theory.  There was no authoritative theoretical system or dogma.  Unlike Scholastics, who obsessed with authorities, mercantilist writers rarely cited each other.  Their argumentation came mostly from the intuition, observations and life experience of the writer, and the impressions of conversations that abounded in the popular press, coffee shops and palace foyers. In the 1600s, one of the urgent topics of political discussion, particularly in England and France, was the Dutch puzzle. The United Provinces of the Netherlands was a tiny country which had only come into existence in the 1580s after a revolt against its Spanish Hapsburg rulers.  But it had managed to spectacularly transform itself almost overnight from a collection of poor, sleepy fishing villages into probably the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world, with an empire that stretched across the globe, from Nagasaki to New Amsterdam, from the Artic Circle to South Africa, and whose citizens enjoyed probably the highest standard of living yet seen in history.    The sudden and spectacular Dutch prosperity provoked the envy and puzzlement of her neighbors. Common sense, carried over from the first economists, suggested that the prosperity of a nation depended on its natural resources. But the tiny Netherlands had hardly any resources - a small population, very little land, virtually no gold, silver, iron ore, timber or other gifts of nature. Yet the Dutch somehow seemed to end up richer than England, France or Spain, countries which were several times larger, with much vaster resources.  Nowhere did this disparity show itself clearly than in wartime.  The monarchs of France, Spain, England and elsewhere routinely bankrupted themselves and taxed their subjects to the bone to eke out just enough revenues to raise an army or fleet, whereas the Dutch government never seemed to run out of money, always capable of mobilizing large armies and fleets quickly and almost effortlessly. Foreign commentators discussed how to emulate (and challenge) the Dutch example. These commentators were precisely those whom we collectively refer to as Mercantilists.   Notable Mercantilists of this era include the English writers William Petty, John Locke, Sir Josiah Child and the French ministers Jean-Baptiste Colbert and Jacques Necker. The Mercantilists concluded that the Dutch achieved their prosperity by maintaining a 'favorable balance of trade' with foreign countries. They noticed that the Dutch exported expensive 'high-value' manufactured goods (notably finished cloth and iron goods like tools, guns, etc.) and only imported cheap 'low-value' primary commodities (raw wool and  iron ore, inputs needed for their industries). As a result, the Dutch exported more ""value"" than they imported. Since foreigners paid more for Dutch goods than what they sold them, that meant that foreign money (gold & silver) was constantly being 'sucked into' the Netherlands. This, the Mercantilists concluded, was why the Dutch were rich.  It also explained also why the English, French et al were always cash-strapped - the Dutch were ""stealing"" their money via the trade balance. The policy conclusion in the royal courts of England, France, Spain, etc. was that the only way to become prosperous is to 'beat the Dutch' at their own game.  The 'Mercantilist' policy formula was quickly devised: Export as much as possible and import as little as possible. Make sure your exports are high-value goods ‚Äì luxuries, manufactures ‚Äì which will bring in a lot of money. If you must import, import only essential low-value goods that are absolutely necessary for your industries ‚Äì that is, only raw materials and other basic necessities you simply cannot  find at home. The Mercantilists expected - or demanded - that the government take an active role in this, and make ""protectionism"" a central part of government policy.  The government was at various times by different authors called upon to  forbid or restrict anybody from taking money out of the country by all sorts of controls and laws,  impose tariffs and quotas to discourage imports and  hand out export subsidies ('bounties') to domestic exporters. Some Mercantilists went further.  The Dutch had a head-start in manufacturing high-value goods, so Mercantilists also recommended that the government actively help out domestic private businessmen set up high-value import-substitution and export-oriented industries. The crown was urged to subsidize these industries, whether directly or indirectly. Infrastructure investment, like roads and ports, to facilitate the export trade, was to be encouraged.  In order to minimize ""destructive competition"" at home, many Mercantilists believed that charter companies had a better chance of succeeding abroad if they were granted a charter with exclusive government-guaranteed monopolies over particular areas of industry and trade.  If, even after all this coddling,  domestic capitalists still could not afford to set these up profitably, then the Crown should set up and run these industries itself. Finally, and perhaps most ominously, the State was also called on to use its diplomatic and military muscle whenever it could - not only to promote domestic trade abroad, but, almost as importantly, to hamper the trade of foreign competitors.  In this connection, the government should  force foreign nations to open their markets for our exports and close their markets to the exports of our competitors.  It should force other nations to give us access to their raw materials and valuable resources for cheap, and prevent the sale of those commodities to our competitors.  If nations are recalcitrant to comply, or insist on open markets, then make war, conquer and/or colonize them yourself. In sum, Mercantilists did not believe there were mutual gains from trade, where both exporters and importers benefited. Rather they saw it as a zero-sum game - exporters always win, importers always lose, so export as much as possible, import as little as possible. Trade was to be conceived as a kind of war -- a war of every nation against every other nation -- to see who could export the most and import the least. And the role of the State was to actively help out in this endeavor - legally, financially and militarily. Mercantilist measures were not usually advocated as a means of promoting domestic trade, industry or employment for their own sake, but rather to ensure a favorable balance of trade.   The overriding objective remained to ensure an inflow of cash (gold, silver) from that favorable balance.  As such, Mercantilists have been accused (notably by Adam Smith) of a ""money fetish"", of confusing cash with wealth, of imagining that the prosperity. of a country is measured solely by the amount of gold and silver it had within its borders, and not its real goods or resources. This is only partially correct.  Mercantilists were obsessed with money, yes.  But the identification of money and prosperity was not always so simplistic.  For Mercantilists, the ""prosperity"" of a nation was not defined as the well-being of its population, but often just of a narrow elite class, or even, in some literature, as a euphemism for the solvency of the State treasury.   Others took a personal analogy, seeing cash as the a store of wealth, and believing wealth accumulation  would be hampered if there was insufficient precious metal to store it in. With the rise of the State,  the 17th Century marked the ascendancy of two classes of peoples needed by the State: bureaucrats to run it and merchants to finance it.   It was from the assorted pamphlets, studies and treatises of these groups of practitioners  that  Mercantilism developed.   In England and Holland, the bulk of the economic writing was done by  merchants drawn from their rising bourgeois communities -- thus the term ""Mercantilism"".  In France and Germany, where the bourgeoisie was smaller, economic arguments were articulated  largely by state officials -- thus French Mercantilism is better known as ""Colbertisme"" (named after Jean-Baptiste Colbert, French minister of finance) while German Mercantilism as ""Cameralism"" (after the German term for the royal chamber).  This difference in background between English-Dutch and French-German Mercantilists did not imply much difference in their economic doctrine.  Both groups recognized the intimate, symbiotic relationship between the wealth of merchants and the power of the State: the flourishing of business meant more revenue and thus power for the State; the power of the State could secure the profitable trading routes and grant the monopolies desired by the merchants.  English Mercantilism is often divided into three phases: the crude ""Bullionist"" stage lasting roughly from the 1580s  to 1620, the ""Traditional"" stage lasting from 1620 to about 1700, overlapping with the ""Liberal"" stage which stretched from the 1680s to the 1750s.  French Colbertisme is said to have lasted between 1660s and 1750s, while German Cameralism had perhaps the longest time span, stretching from 1560s to 1750s and, through the hands of Neo-Cameralists, stretching even beyond 1800. At the heart of the Mercantilist system is an obsession with the positive feedback between growth and wealth accumulation:  more economic activity meant more wealth (for merchants and the State), more wealth meant more activity.  They recognized two basic preconditions for increasing enterprise:  the existence of profit opportunities and flexible credit facilities.  The Mercantilists proposed that activity rose whenever prices rose (because they believed higher prices meant higher profits) and interest rates fell (thus easier credit).   Both of these things occur, they noted, when the quantity of money in a country is increased.   Money, in the those days, was gold and silver. Thus, in order to increase national output, the early  Mercantilists recommended, every effort, fair or foul, must be made by the State to ensure that, whether bullion or coins, as much gold and silver as possible enters that country and as little as possible leaves the country. Initially, this was thought to involve direct restrictions on the export of gold, a practice highly recommended by the Bullionist strain of Mercantilists, notably Thomas Milles and Gerald de Malynes.   This brought the protest of the charter companies, notably the Society of Merchant Adventurers and the British East India Company, which traded extensively overseas and needed the gold export restrictions relaxed (cf. Wheeler, 1601).  The influential ..\profiles\malynes.htm (1601, 1621) inveighed thunderously against the companies, blaming them and their allies for the ruin of England.   He protested to the English Court that the Charter companies, by setting an exchange ratio for English currency below its intrinsic worth (which had been so ""wisely"" decided upon the court) were not only undermining royal authority and Divine justice, but by encouraging the exportation of specie were thus a ""cancer"" on the Commonwealth.  He recommended even more draconian restrictions on export of specie as a way to fix the problem and ""reflate"" the economy.  No friend to financiers, Malynes resurrected the old Scholastic arguments against usury, arguing that interest created an unnatural cost of credit and held back enterprise. Against Malynes's recommendations were arrayed two formidable writers, Thomas Misselden and Thomas Mun -- the former more of a agitator, the latter more of a scholar, but both charter company men.  Misselden and Mun admitted the benefit of specie inflow, but did not blame outflows on ""evil financiers"" and charter companies maintaining a separate exchange ratio for currency, but rather on the external balance of trade.  Mun, in particular noted that outflows/inflows of gold are determined by the balance of payments, which includes the balance of trade, but also capital transfers.  Their recommendation was that the state can only stem the outflow of gold not by restrictions on gold movements, but rather by encouraging exports and discouraging imports.  This  trade-specie flow mechanism, they argued, could not be disabled by royal dictation but was a   mechanism forced upon the nations of the world by ""natural law"".  It cannot be stopped, but it can be encouraged in the right direction.  The optimal formula had already been laid out years earlier by Jean Bodin: impose high tariffs and duties on the export of raw materials and the import of finished goods, and low tariffs and duties on the import of raw materials and the export of finished goods. Another contribution of Mun was the recognition that perhaps rising prices were not all that desirable: they decrease the competitiveness of  exports, thus worsening the balance of trade and lead to gold outflow.  This had not been recognized by Malynes or Misselden, who had argued repeatedly for the benefits of price inflation.   The Mercantilists struggled with, but never actually resolved, the contradiction between the industry-stimulating but export-crippling price rises. Another concern was the possibility of rising prices and industry might also lead to rising wages that might cut into those profits and thus reduce output.  The Mercantilists did not mince words on this: they recommended that wages should be kept as low as possible. They believed that low real wages actually increased the productivity of laborers (an effect later disputed and reversed by Cantillon and the Ricardians).   To keep wages low, the  Mercantilists applauded policies aimed at increasing population and recommended the use of labor-saving machinery whenever possible. The watershed in Mercantilist thinking was the work of William Petty (1690).  He began focusing attention on income distribution and the relative values of the contributions of ""factors of production"", which, for him, was basically labor and land.  It was Petty that initiated the idea that rent on land was a surplus above wage payments.   Petty's exercise anticipated that of Ricardian rent -- indeed, he went so far as to talk about diminishing returns to land on the basis of their distance from the market.   Wages, for Petty, were determined by what was necessary for the laborer   ""Live, Labor and Generate"".   Petty used this to initate the ""labor theory of value"" whereby the relative values of goods were determined by the relative amounts of labor-time involved in producing them.  He justified this equality of relative labor time and relative prices on the basis of arbitrage.  He also used arbitrage reasoning to argue that the interest on capital would be equated with the rent on land (but Petty did not really have a good, independent theory of capital).    Thus, Petty anticipates many of the later Classical Ricardian doctrines. Mercantilism was given another twist in its ""liberal"" phase spearheaded by Nicholas Barbon (1690). and Sir Dudley North (1691) and followed up (if modestly) by Sir Josiah Child (1693) and Charles Davenant. They were perhaps the first to recognize that international trade, far from being a zero-sum game, could be mutually beneficial to both parties.  North was also one of the first to begin talking about ""profit"" and ""capital"" as a distinct factor of production,  and recognized that money was only of value when lent out for capital.    The theory of money was also given more careful consideration by John Locke (1692), who formulated the concept of ""velocity"" and effectively initiated the Quantity Theory of Money. Mercantilist doctrine maintained itself throughout much of the 18th Century.  The rise of the Enlightenment, however, changed things substantially.    The works of Richard Cantillon, Jacques Turgot and the Physiocrats in France and David Hume and his friend Adam Smith in Great Britain, were often designed to go directly against Mercantilist opinion.  Their new view that the wealth of a nation really arises from circulating income flows and their insistence on the neutrality of money, undermined the Mercantilists's ""stock-of-money"" concept of wealth.   The Enlightenment economists also introduced the idea of ""natural balance"" of those flows, which effectively replaced the ""growth obsession"" of the Mercantilists with the ""equilibrium obsession"" of the Enlightenment economists. These new ideas were not immediately successful.  The Physiocrats remained in the shadows of the French court, with the Colbertistes and anti-Physiocrats such as Forbonnais still maintaining their great influence on policy.  Great Britain, on the dawn of its industrial revolution, was somewhat more receptive to the new doctrines, although it could still produce remarkable Mercantilists such as Sir James Steuart (1767).   Germany, for the most part, remained immune from the new theories, and safely in the hands of the Neo-Cameralists well into the 19th Century.

French Colbertisme," The ""Colbertistes"" are the name commonly given to French Mercantilists.  They are named after their guiding spirit, Jean-Baptiste Colbert,  the powerful contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral of King Louis XIV of France, in the latter part of the 17th Century.  Colbertisme was born out of the peculiar political and fiscal situation of France.  Unlike England, which had achieved a internal political and economic unity and centralization quite early on, France had spent much of its existence broken up into pieces.  Although the largest and richest of European nations, the French state had been congenitally incapable of mobilizing those resources to its ends.  As a result, French monarchs were routinely bullied by their vassals and preyed upon by nimbler neighbors.  France stumbled into the 17th Century, devastated by a brutal religious civil war (1560-1598), but at least politically united under the new Bourbon king Henry IV.  The first matter of business taken up by the Maximilien de B√©thune (Duke of Sully), Henry IV's finance minister from 1598, was the reorganization of monarchical finances which were, at the time, in a mess.   The Duke of Sully inaugurated his term by engineering the second French State bankruptcy in 1599, repudiating large chunks of the public debt, replacing them with new annuities in return for further loans. He instituted new taxes on office-holders (the paulette), lowered the official interest rate, improved tax-collection and reigned in court expenditures, gradually bringing the French crown back into solvency. Sully's most famous innovation was the finalization of the Cinq Grosses Fermes, grouping five major tariffs. .He also begins the build-up of a new network of roads and canals to improve transportation and the channeling of funds to improve agriculture. He also lifts restrictions on the circulation of grain and wine (1601).  Sully also encouraged the formation of the first French East Indies companies to compete for spice trade in Asia with the newly-formed Dutch and English companies.  However, it was not a success.  The French merchant communities (mostly concentrated in the Atlantic ports of Brittany and Normandy) had tremendous problems drumming up the capital.  The first company - sometimes known as the ""Saint-Malo company"" - manage to cobble a little fleet in 1601 under the Sieur de la Bardeliere, but it was a failure.  Although the French East Indies charter would be passed around for the years, through various companies and incarnations, the next expedition was only sent out in 1617.  Sully was more apprehensive about the Canada and personally objected to the fur-trade monopoly granted to DuGua du Mons (who went to establish the colony of French Acadia in Canada in 1604).  Sully resigned in 1611, a year after Henry IV's assassination, unable to work with the new regent queen Marie de' Medici. French economic policy nonetheless remained in the hands of Henry IV's old advisors for a while, and continued to follow the example of Sully. The rise of the Armand de Plessis (Cardinal Richelieu) in the 1620s opened a more energetic phase of French history.   Richelieu's active foreign policy and wars were costly, but Richelieu paid for them with increasing centralization, including the introduction of intendants (royal tax inspectors) in the provinces, granting them (in 1629) the authority to bypass local authorities and report directly to the crown, to ensure that taxes were delivered.  Richelieu also took an active interest in overseas commerce. In 1626, Richelieu granted charters to three new French companies: the first French West Indies company (Compagnie de Saint-Christophe) to establish sugar colonies in the Caribbean, the first African trading company (Compagnie de Dieppe and Rouen) to open the slave trade in West Africa, and a new Canadian fur-trading company (Compagnie de Morbihan).  After the ""Day of the Dupes"" in 1630, control of finances was passed firmly into the hands of Richelieu. Needing the political loyalty of the provincial estates, Richelieu scrapped plans to convert the Pays d'etat provinces into Pays d'elections.  He made up for fiscal shortfalls with the sale of new offices and heavily increasing taxes - the taille (property tax) and gabelle (salt tax) would be doubled in a few short years. But the French entry into the Thirty Years War in 1634 blew up the budget.  Richelieu increased taxes even more and made intendants (hitherto temporary) into permanent positions.  In 1636, Hapsburg armies invaded France, expected to exploit a tax revolt, but it failed to materialize. Richelieu also saw some significant monetary reforms, notably the introduction of the gold Louis d'or in 1640 and a new silver ecu in 1642. Richelieu death in 1642 was followed a few month later by the death of his master Louis XIII.  The French state fell into the hands of Richelieu's successor as new chief minister, Cardinal Jules Mazarin, who, together with the queen-mother Anne of Austria, headed the regency council for the toddler king Louis XIV.  Jean-Baptiste Colbert emerged from the shadows as an assistant to Mazarin.  After the death of Mazarin in 1661, Louis XIV appointed himself his own prime minister, and Colbert transferred to the king's service.  Colbert helped Louis XIV topple Nicolas Foquet, the powerful superintendant of finances, and, in 1663, Colbert was given the position of Comptroller-General of Finances (Contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral des finances), the supreme head of the French state finances, and began setting France on a ""Mercantilist"" tack - transforming the vast agricultural country of France into a commercial and industrial power to rival Holland and England.  While external barriers went up, internal barriers were brought down to facilitate the growth of vital industries. e.g. 1664, Colbert turned the Cinq Grosses Fermes into a single internal customs union on north and western France, abolishing customs duties within them. The corvee was revived for road-building, connecting ports to internal industries.. Charter companies were revived and manufacturing luxury works were coddled with State assistance. Caribbean and African colonies were acquired.  The nautical and manufacturing industries of the Atlantic ports took off. But for all of Colbert's efforts, Louis XIV's insistence on wars in Europe - and there were many wars - and the erection of a grand palace and maintenance of a court at Versailles stretched the sinews of the French state treasury.  Colbert miraculously managed to maintain some control and keeping it from busting the crown's finances.  But when Colbert died in 1683, the restraining hand was gone.  Louis XIV pursued ever more wars and ever greater extravagances.  At his death in 1715, the French crown was bankrupt.  Many of the state officials called for a return to the ""Colbertisme"" as a way out of the subsequent fiscal mess.

The Physiocrats," The Physiocrats  were a group of French Enlightenment thinkers of  the 1760s that surrounded the French court physician, Fran√ßois Quesnay.  The founding document of Physiocratic school was Quesnay's Tableau √âconomique (1759).  The inner circle included the Marquis de Mirabeau, Mercier de la Rivi√®re, Dupont de Nemours, Le Trosne, the Abb√© Baudeau and a handful of others.  To contemporaries, they were often referred to simply as les √©conomistes.   The cornerstone of the Physiocratic doctrine was Fran√ßois Quesnay's (1759, 1766) axiom that only agriculture yielded a surplus -- what he called a produit net (net product).  Manufacturing and commerce, the Physiocrats argued, took up as much value as inputs into production as it created in output, and consequently created no net product.  Like many Enlightenment thinkers, and contrary to the Mercantilists,  the Physiocrats believed that the wealth of a nation lay not in its stocks of gold and silver, but rather in the size of its net product.  But it was the identification of that net product solely with agriculture that the Physiocrats were distinct. The Physiocrats argued that the old Colbertiste policies of encouraging commercial and industrial corporations was wrong-headed.   It is not that commerce and manufacturing should  be discouraged, they said, but rather that it is not worthwhile for the government to distort the whole economy with monopolistic charters, controls and protective tariffs to prop up sectors which produced no net product and thus added no wealth to a nation.   Government policy, if any, should be geared to maximizing the value and output of the agricultural sector. But how?  French agriculture at the time was still trapped in Medieval regulations which shackled enterprising farmers.  Latter-day feudal obligations -- such as the corv√©e, the yearly labor farmers owed to the state -- were still in force.   The monopoly power of the merchant guilds in towns did not permit farmers to sell their output to the highest bidder and buy their inputs from cheapest source.    An even bigger obstacle were the internal tariffs on the movement of grains between regions, which seriously hampered agricultural commerce. Public works essential for the agricultural sector, such as roads and drainage, remained in a deplorable state. Restrictions on the migration of agricultural laborers meant that a nation-wide labor market could not take shape.  Farmers in productive areas of the country faced labor shortages and inflated wage costs, thus forcing them to scale down their activities. In unproductive areas, in contrast, masses of unemployed workers wallowing in penury kept wages too low and thus local farmers were not encouraged to implement any more productive agricultural techniques.    It is at this point that the Physiocrats jumped into their laissez-faire attitude. They called for the removal of restrictions on internal trade and labor migration, the abolition of the corv√©e, the removal of state-sponsored monopolies and trading privileges, the dismantling of the guild system, etc.   On fiscal matters, the Physiocrats famously pushed for their ""single tax"" on land rents -- l'imp√¥t unique.  The Physiocrats argued that as land is the only source of wealth, then the burden of all taxes ultimately bears down on the landowner.  So instead of levying a complicated collection of scattered taxes (which are difficult to administer and can cause temporary distortions), it is most efficient to just go to the root and tax land rents directly. However practical many of the Physiocrats' policy measures were, they wrapped their arguments in metaphysical clouds.  They differentiated between the ordre naturel (natural order, or the social order dictated by nature's laws) and the ordre positif (positive order, or the social order dictated by human ideals).  They charged that social philosophers had gotten both of these mixed up.  The ordre positif was wholly about man-made conventions, about how society should be organized to conform to some human-constructed ideal.  This, they argued, was what the ""natural law"" and ""social contract"" philosophers, like Locke and Rousseau, were concerned with.  However, there was, the Physiocrats argued, nothing ""natural"" in them at all -- and so these theories ought to be dumped.  In contrast, the ordre naturel were the laws of nature, which were God-given and unalterable by human construct.   The believed that the only choice humans had was either to structure their polity, economy and society in conformity with the ordre naturel or to go against it.  The Physiocrats felt that they had figured out what the ordre naturel actually was.  They believed that the policies they prescribed would bring it about.  The term ""Physiocracy"" itself (introduced by Dupont de Nemours (1767)) literally translates to ""the rule of nature"".  So what was this ordre naturel?  The economics of it are simple.  The Physiocrats identified three classes of the economy: the ""productive"" class (agricultural laborers and farmers), the ""sterile"" class (industrial laborers, artisans and merchants) and the ""proprietor"" class (who appropriated the net product as rents).  Incomes flowed from sector to sector, and thus class to class.  A ""natural state"" of the economy emerged when these income flows were in a state of ""balance"", i.e. where no sector expanded and none contracted.  Once the ""natural state"" was achieved, the economy just continued humming along, reproducing itself indefinitely. The Physiocrats explained their system in the famous Tableau √âconomique (1758) of Fran√ßois Quesnay. (click here for an analysis of Quesnay's Tableau). It has been argued that Quesnay developed this idea because, as a physician, he drew an analogy with the circulation of blood and the ""homeostasis"" of a body.  But, in truth, the idea of a natural balance of income flows had already been expounded in the economic theories of Pierre de Boisguilbert and Richard Cantillon.  Indeed, the Physiocrats also owed to Cantillon their ""land theory of value"".  (see our review of Cantillon's sytem).  It is interesting to note that the Physiocrats defended their laissez-faire policy conclusions not merely by pragmatic arguments about improving agricultural production, but more often by mystical views about the role of the government in their ordre naturel.  The Physiocrats, unlike some of their contemporaries,  continued to view the State as a parasitical entity.  It lives off the economy and society, but it is not part of it.  Government has no prescribed place in the ordre naturel.  Its only role is to set the laws of men in a way that permits the God-given laws of nature to bring the natural order about.  Any attempt by the government to influence the economy against these natural forces leads to imbalances which postpone the arrival of the natural state and keep the net product below what it would otherwise be. A general laissez-faire policy and the ""single tax"" were the speediest, least distortionary and least costly ways of arriving at the natural state. The Physiocrats believed that net product of the natural state was the maximum net product sustainable over the long-run.  Unlike the Mercantilists, the Physiocrats did not really spend too much time thinking about whether maximizing the net product was a ""good"" idea (e.g. did it enhance the power of the sovereign? did it produce general happiness? did improve general morality?, etc.).  Following up on Cantillon, the ""friend of mankind"", Mirabeau (1756) mumbled something about the true wealth of a nation being its population, ergo the greater the net product, the greater the population sustainable.  But most of them focused on the fact that it was the ""natural"" thing to do.  And anything that is ""natural"", according to the spirit of the age, was the ""good"" thing to do. The policy measures advocated by the Physiocrats were sometimes identified with the interests of the nobility and the landed gentry, despite their single tax falling entirely upon them. They earned much opposition from the Neo-Colbertistes of the age, who felt France must continue to endeavor to become a commercial and industrial power, like the Netherlands or England. Because Quesnay was the private physician to Madame de Pomapadour, the mistress of Louis XV, the Physiocratic clique enjoyed a good degree of protection in the French court. However, after Pompadour's death in 1764, the Physiocrats influence diminished somewhat at Court.  However, it was precisely around this time that the Physiocrats decided to expand their influence and take their message to the population at large.  The Marquis de Mirabeau launched his celebrated ""Tuesday dinners"" at his home in Paris.  Quesnay did not attend, but the Physiocratic sect made it their ""public"" headquarters to recruit new members.  Dupont de Nemours took charge of disseminating the doctrine in print.  In 1765-7, the Physiocrats were publishing furiously in the Journal d'agricultures, du commerce et des finances, which DuPont was then editing with a dogmatic zeal.  Some of Quesnay's own early economic writing were barred from publication by DuPont for not being ""Physiocratic"" enough!  After DuPont was removed in 1767, the Physiocrats switched to the Eph√©m√©rides du Citoyen run by the Abb√© Baudeau.  In 1767, DuPont de Nemours published his Physiocratie,  the definitive statement of the school doctrine.   The Physiocrats' own style did not help their case.  Their dogmatism, their pompousness, their mysticism about the ordre naturel, their ""rituals"" at Mirabeau's Tuesday dinners, the affected, flowery way in which they wrote their tracts, their petty ""cliquishness"", their unrestrained adulation and worship of Quesnay -- whom they referred to as the ""Confucius of Europe"", the ""modern Socrates"" -- irked just about everybody around them.  Even those who ought to be their natural allies, such as Voltaire, Diderot, Rousseau and de Mably, despised the Physiocrats with a passion. In a letter to Morellet regarding his upcoming Dictionnaire, the otherwise good-natured David Hume expressed his disdain for them thus: ""I hope that in your work you will thunder them, and crush them, and pound them, and reduce them to dust and ashes!  They are, indeed, the set of men the most chimerical and most arrogant that now exist, since the annihilation of the Sorbonne.""  (Hume, Letter to Morellet, July 10, 1769) Adam Smith killed them with faint praise, arguing that the Physiocratic system ""never has done, and probably never will do any harm in any part of the world"" (Smith, 1776). Ferdinando Galiani saw them as anything but harmless.  For him, the Physiocrats were a dangerous group of impractical men with wrong ideas. In 1768, as France collapsed in a near-famine, the Physiocrats still called for ""non-action"", muttering on about their ordre naturel and the glorious wisdom of Quesnay.  This galvanized Galiani and his followers into making their own remarkable contributions in opposition.   Opposition to the Physiocrats also energized the Neo-Colbertistes.  Fran√ßois Veron de Forbonnais and Jean Graslin sharpened and modernized Mercantilist doctrines, bringing them in touch with the Enlightenment spirit partly in order to combat the Physiocrats' appeal.    As a contemporary writer has noted, although the Physiocratic system was accused of being ""mysticism parading as science"", the truth was perhaps quite the opposite. Physiocracy was more ""science parading as mysticism"".  For this reason, the Physiocrats still exerted a considerable amount of influence on the development of economics. Of particular interest are the modifications introduced by Jacques Turgot and his followers, which we might call a distinctive ""Turgotian"" sect.  They moved away from Physiocratic dogmatism by arguing that industry, and not only agriculture, could also produce a net product.  The modified Turgotian system, when channeled into the hands of  Adam Smith, would yield up the  ""labor theory of value"" of  the Classical School. Still, for a brief period, the Physiocrats and their ideas were sought everywhere.  The rulers of Baden, Sweden, Tuscany, Poland, Russia, Austria and even the United States, consulted the Physiocrats.  The high-water mark of their influence was Jacques Turgot's brief tenure as contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral of France from 1774 to 1776.  Under Turgot,  many of the Physiocratic policy propositions -- e.g. the lifting of internal tariffs, the abolition of the corv√©e, the single tax -- were instituted.  During this period, the Physiocrats exploded into print again with the short-lived  Nouvelles Eph√©m√©rides Economiques (1774-1776).  However, with the fall of Turgot in 1776, his reforms were reversed and the Physiocrats were tossed, once again, out of the limelight.

The Scottish Enlightenment," The Scottish Enlightenment refers to the period of intellectual ferment in Scotland, between roughly the 1740s and 1790s.  During this period, Scottish academicians and intellectuals distinguished themselves for numerous breakthroughs philosophy, ethics, history, jurisprudence, sociology, political science and, of course, economics.  Its best known protagonists are probably David Hume and Adam Smith. Scotland on the Eve Scotland's connection to England began officially in 1603, when King James VI of Scotland inherited the English crown and became also King James I of England. The kingdoms were still theoretically distinct, both crowns just happened to sit on the same head.  This remained the case until the 1707 Act of Union, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland into a single ""United Kingdom of Great Britain"". Before 1707, there had been surprisingly little contact or even less good feeling between the two nations. As the historian, G.M. Trevelyan, has noted, ""The Scot was either a Jacobite or a Presbyterian, and in either capacity he alienated four fifths of English sympathy.""  Few Scotsmen traveled south and even fewer Englishmen traveled north.  Scotland's traditional ally, France, was England's traditional enemy. Scottish scholars and clergymen looked to the universities and seminaries of Continental Europe, rather than England, to further their educations and garner intellectual inspiration.   The internal structure of Scotland was also quite different from England.  The Edinburgh parliament was an incredibly corrupt and unrepresentative institution dominated by ""gangs"" of noblemen, so its disappearance in 1707 was not that keenly felt . The interlocking system of assemblies of elders of the Presbyterian Kirk of Scotland had long served as the real government - the parish-level Kirk sessions, where the voices of the laity were heard, were the only real local government in Scotland, and Kirk's general assembly was more of a national parliament than the official Edinburgh Parliament had ever been.   The Scottish economy was also quite poor, agrarian and stagnant.  Scottish agriculture was semi-feudal and unproductive, run via the ""run-rig"" system in unenclosed fields with peculiarly short tenancies.   On the upside, compared to their English counterparts, the Scottish lords were decidedly more paternalistic, their lifestyle and culture much closer to that of their tenants -- which did wonders for social relations.  And then, of course, there were the mysterious and impenetrable Highlands, run by the ""barbarous"" clans, whose social, cultural, political and economic structures were a thousand years behind anything else in Britain. Before 1707, economic interaction between the two nations was virtually nil, even on the borderlands (where the degree of animosity between the populations was perhaps the greatest). English Mercantilist policies ensured that Scots were barred access to English markets and colonies.  Scottish commercial cities -- which, almost always, just meant Glasgow -- were little more than provincial entrep√¥ts.  Scotland's attempts to muscle in on colonial commerce started -- and ended -- with the ill-fated ""Darien scheme"" to set up a Scottish colony in Central America in 1698.    The 1707 Act of Union did not change all this overnight.  The marriage was a painful one that took over a century to work itself through. At least three bloody Jacobite rebellions -- in 1690, 1715 and 1745 -- rocked Scotland to its very foundations. The Kirk of Scotland barely withstood the strain of their new episcopalian relations, and eventually broke apart in a schism. In the aftermath of  ""the '45"", the Scottish nobility lost their remaining feudal powers and the Highlands were conquered and subdued.  In the grip of English leather gloves, Scotland was dragged, kicking and screaming, into modernity.   Themes The main worry of 18th Century Scots, particularly after '45, was how the poor, backward and stagnant Scotland would fare when thrown into a common market and destiny with England's world-class dynamic economy. The Glasgow merchants welcomed the lifting of trade barriers and access to colonies (they were quick to hone in on the tobacco trade), but they also realized that they had nowhere near the experience, financing and political clout of their English competitors.  As the agricultural and industrial revolutions advanced in England, the Scottish gentry and peasantry alike wondered nervously about how much time they had left before English-style capitalism transformed the Scottish countryside into ""factories of corn and beef"".  Would Scotland become prosperous like England, or would it descend into dependent pauperism like Ireland?  And how would the new self-seeking capitalist ethos bode on the stern morals and traditional values of the Scottish people?  These questions were foremost on the minds of the Scottish philosophers of the 18th Century.  As so many times before, they looked to their French counterparts for answers.  France was then enjoying its age of Enlightenment and, quickly enough, the intellectual fire spread to Scotland.  Although sharing the French speculative-rationalist spirit, the work of the Scottish philosophers was tempered with doses of skepticism and a more pronounced form of empiricism and utilitarianism.  Also, unlike the French, the Scottish thinkers were particularly concerned with change  - notably,  economic growth and development, the consequences of international trade and the mechanics of an emerging urban, commercial, bourgeois society -- concerns reflecting the reality of post-1707 Scotland.  Furthermore, without a State to call their own, the Scots were much less concerned than their Continental counterparts with government reforms. The ""Scottish Enlightenment"" stretched roughly from 1740 to 1790.  Unlike in France, many of its protagonists were academics.  Francis Hutcheson,  Adam Smith,  Thomas Reid and John Millar were professors at the University of Glasgow.  Adam Ferguson, Dugald Stewart and William Robertson were at the University of Edinburgh.  The universities of Aberdeen and St. Andrews were dominated by their students.  But there were also important figures outside the academy who influenced the course of the dialogue, including Lord Kames, Robert Wallace, Sir James Steuart, Dr. James Anderson and, above everybody else, the towering figure of David Hume. The three major areas of concern for Scottish philosophers were moral philosophy, history and economics.  In all three, David Hume blazed the way, with the other Scottish philosophers following him in support or in criticism.   In moral philosophy, the main question was whether the acquisitive ethics of capitalism could be made compatible with traditional virtues of sociability, sympathy and justice.  The issue had been provoked by Bernard de Mandeville in his famous thesis that ""private vices"" lead to substantial ""public benefits"", whereas virtuous behavior does very little good at all.  The Scottish philosophers wanted to show that the choice between private virtue and public good was a false one.  The scandalous resolution forwarded by David Hume (1739-40) was that moral values and judgments were social constructions anyway.  Anything that is pleasurable, Hume argued, people will judge ""virtuous"" and anything that is painful, they will call ""vice"".  Consequently, we need not worry about the corruption of morals by capitalism.  Private moral judgments will evolve with it.   Hume's hedonistic solution was turned upside down by Francis Hutcheson (1725, 1755), who argued that virtue yields pleasure because it conforms to our natural and innate ""moral sense"", while vice yields pain because it is unnatural.  As a result, Hutcheson came up with the utilitarian ethical precepts that the height of virtue was achieving the ""greatest good for the greatest number"". Adam Smith (1759) attempted to reconcile the Hume and Hutcheson positions via the artifice of ""natural sympathy"" and the ""impartial spectator"".   In history, the Scots had a tendency to come up with meta-sociological accounts of the ""natural progress"" of civilization. This ""natural history"" or ""conjectural history"" approach  was initiated by Lord Kames and his protege David Hume (1757). Conjectural history took a distinct ""stages"" form in the hands of Adam Ferguson (1767), John Millar (1771) and Adam Smith (1776) .  The Scottish approach initiated by Kames envisaged history as progressing through four economic stages, attended by political and social structures: a hunting and gathering stage, a pastoral and nomadic stage, a agricultural and feudalist stage and the final commerce and manufacturing stage (which Scotland was now entering).   Like Ferguson, Smith regarded the division of labor and the expansion of commerce as the fundamental driver of historical evolution.  The efforts of the Scottish school led Voltaire to note that  ""we look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilization"".  A decidedly different form of history  -- the ""narrative"" history -- was also pursued by the Scottish scholars.  In this, David Hume (who else?) led the way with his controversial History of England (1754-1762).  With varying degrees of success, great narrative histories were also advanced by other Scottish scholars, such as Robertson (1759, 1769) and Ferguson (1783).  This historical style was taken up in England by Edward Gibbon in his famous 1776 account of the decline and fall of Rome. On political economy, David Hume (1752) initiated a different approach.  Instead of embedding economics in a social and historical context, as he had morals and religion, Hume decided instead to let the laws of economics stand on their own, externally and eternally.  Rejecting both the Mercantilist doctrines which fetishized money and the French approach which emphasized the primacy of agriculture, Hume identified commerce as the main engine of economic growth, with jealousy of trade and the misuse of money and credit as its main obstacles.  Ferguson's (1767) division of labor added another dimension.   Against Hume, Robert Wallace (1758) and Sir James Steuart (1767) attempted to revive the Mercantilist orthodoxy (albeit in more liberal dress).  But Steuart's work, in turn, provoked the great thesis of Adam Smith -- The Wealth of Nations (1776) -- which placed industry and manufacturing in the position of honor.   Although the achievements of the Scottish scholars were toasted in France, they did not have an immediate impact south of the border.  While their northern cousins were asking hard questions about mankind, English intellectuals, with some exceptions, wallowed in the shallow self-congratulations of the barren age of Dr. Johnson.  As Hume asked Smith, shortly before the latter published an English edition of his work, ""How can you so much as entertain a thought of publishing a Book, full of Reason, Sense, and Learning, to those wicked, abandoned Madmen?"" The Scottish Enlightenment came gradually to an end in the early 1800s, after the death of its leading protagonists and the rise of Christian pietism in Scotland reacted against the ""refined paganism"" and Whiggery of the Scottish philosophers. Nonetheless, from his perch at the University of Edinburgh, Dugald Stewart preserved the flame of Adam Smith, and educated a generation of scholars and statesmen that would transform the British intellectual and political landscape in the 19th Century. The values and ideas of the Scottish Enlightenment were carried south of the border by the former students of Dugald  Stewart.  Critical in this process was The Edinburgh Review, founded in 1802 by Sydney Smith, Francis Jeffrey, Francis Horner and Henry Brougham.  Consciously named after the Adam Smith's 1755 journal, the new Edinburgh Review delivered the Scottish philosophy and doctrines to the English reading public, and had a formative impact on national opinion, helping revitalize the Whig Party and endowing it with a liberal platform.  Both James Mill and John Ramsay McCulloch, the leaders of the Classical Ricardian School in the early 19th Century, were trained in the Scottish Enlightenment tradition, found London a suitable perch to continue its work.  The Scottish Enlightenment had effectively graduated out of its provincial academic chairs to become a national phenomenon that would dominate a good part of the 19th Century - the classical school in economics and classical liberalism in politics.

The Italian Tradition,"Up until recently, Italian economists did not figure very prominently in histories of economic thought.  Most English-speaking economists would probably only be able to name the giants Vilfredo Pareto and Piero Sraffa (both of whom were emigrants, incidentally).  But Italy has had a very old and distinctive heritage in economics that is impossible to ignore.   Italian writers generally figure prominently in the Scholastic era, of course, and the Renaissance. Many of their early works were handbooks to guide governance - some from the heights of religious or humanist idealism, like Matteo Palmieri, others grounded in the more hard-nosed realities of a commercially-minded society, like Machiavelli and Carafa.  Still others tried to maintain the connection between idealism and practice - such as Botero on governance, Davanzati on money, or Stracca on commercial law.  Perhaps most famous was Antonio Serra's Breve Tratatto (1613), considered by many to be the first great treatise on political economy.  In the 18th Century, the Neapolitan economist, Ferdinando Galiani (1751) ""broke off"" from the main streams of Enlightenment economic thinking.  He rejected  the path of the French Physiocratic and Scottish schools and defended Mercantilist policies, but with a twist. Galiani initiated the two avenues which formed the ""Italian tradition"" in economics: the serious analysis of  government as an economic entity and a utility-based theory of natural value.   For Galiani, the economy must be analyzed more juridically than pseudo-scientifically.  Government, he argued, is an important entity in any economy. It can, via its laws and fiscal policies, influence the economy and society for good and evil.  Theories of the ""natural state"" without a State were, for him, hopelessly abstract and dangerously naive.  The policy conclusions of the Physiocratic sect -- laissez-faire, laissez-passer -- were a consequence of their having excluded the State by assumption.  Galiani's line of reasoning was closer to the French Neo-Colbertistes and German Neo-Cameralists. Galiani also argued that the  ""cost"" theories of value which the Physiocrats embraced were plain wrong. In his view, natural value arises from utility-based demand interacting with the scarcity of supply -- an argument already anticipated by another Italian, Bernardo Davanzati.  This idea was developed in parallel in France by men like Abb√© Condillac, Jacques Turgot and others.   British Classical economics made its way to Italy in the 19th C.   Sometime expatriates, like Giovanni Arrivabene brought acquaintance with the Belgian-French liberal school. During this period, the leading figure was doubtlessly Francesco Ferrara, at the time professor in Turin.  It was Ferrara who spearheaded the creation of the Societ√† di Economia Politica in 1852, composed mostly of Piedmontese economists and liberal political figures - the society's first president was Camillo Cavour.  But after Italian unification in 1861, and Ferrara's semi-retirement into politics, the focus of activity moved to Florence, the new capital.  In the 1850s and 1860s, Ferrara also put out the Biblioteca dell' Economista, a series of Italian translations of classical economic works from Britain and France, which was helped popularize economics in Italy. On the initiative of  Francesco Protonotari, editor of the influential literary journal Nuova Antologia, a new national association, the ""Societ√† di Economia Politica Italiana"" was launched at a conference in Florence (June 1868). Originally intended as a professional association of emerging professional economists, it soon devolved, as its predecessor had, into a policy shop-talk, exposing the fissures between Italian liberals and a new crop of more interventionist Italian economists inspired by the German Historical School   (the Italian historicists got the appellation the  ""Lombard-Venetian school"" - bestowed upon them by Ferrara - as its most prominent professors taught at Pavia and Padua).    Alarmed at the rise of the historicists, Francesco Ferrara published a polemical article in the Nuova Antologia (Aug 1874) denouncing the Lombard-Venetian historicists as ""Germanizers"", Socialists and spoilers of Italian youth .  Ferrara encouraged fellow liberals to found the ""Societ√† Adamo Smith"" in Florence (Sep 1874), and a journal, L'Economista, committed to the defense of classical liberal principles and against the state interventionism advocated by the historicists. In the meantime, Lombard-Venetian historicists responded with a circular letter, known as the ""Padua manifesto"" (dated Sep 11, 1874), signed by Luigi Cossa, Antonio Scialoja, Fedele Lampertico, and Luigi Luzzatti, articulating the principles of the new historicist school and calling on a conference to discuss social reform.  The Padua circular was subscribed by numerous young Italian economists,     At their congress in Milan in January 1875, the Lombard-Venetian historicists formed the ""Associazone per il Progresso degli Studi Economici"" (modeled on the German Verein) and went on to found a new economics journal, the Giornale degli economisti (GdE) later that same year (April 1875). Around this time, the Italian politician and sometime economist Quintinio Sella got into the mix by persuading the prestigious Reale Accademia dei Lincei in Rome (of which he was president since 1874) to set up a section on ""Moral, Historical and Philological Science"", which included a space for political economy.. Four economists were appointed to the Accademia dei Lincei - Antonio Scialoja, Fedele Lampertico, Angelo Messedaglia and Luigi Luzzatti - all of them of the Lombard-Venetian school, three of them authors of the Padua manifesto. To balance things out a bit, Ferrara became a member of the Lincei in 1876, but simultaneously the German historicist Wilhelm Roscher was invited as a foreign honorary member.   The methodenstreit between the liberal ""Tuscan"" school and the historicist ""Lombard-Venetian"" school drove a split in Italian economists that dragged on through the 1870s.  Nonetheless, both societies, and their journals, were relatively short-lived.  Like the societies before them, they quickly descended into the political realm and served up little academic fare, serving primarily as vehicles for policy debates on parliamentary bills.. By the time of the Marginalist Revolution,  the Italians were not caught by surprise and contributed much to its early construction.  Indeed, the bulk of the Lausanne School came from Italy -- Vilfredo Pareto, Enrico Barone, Giovanni Antonelli, Pasquale Boninsegni, Luigi Amoroso, etc.  Some commentators, such as Henry Schultz, have preferred to call it simply the ""Italian School"".  The influential Neoclassical economist  Maffeo Pantaleoni,  the Italian ""Marshall"", can be considered part of this group.  The Giornale degli Economisti was re-launched by Pantaleoni in 1890, now as a mouthpiece of Neocassical liberalism. The economic theory of the State was a more distinctively Italian concern and passed through several stages. In its earliest stage, it was explicitly utilitarian.  Cesar Beccaria, and Pietro Verri  focused their analysis on the impact of the State and fiscal policy on the economy.  They viewed the state as an instrument to improve general social welfare (whether by engaging or disengaging from the economy; reshaping its laws and practices, etc.).  The Italians found in the notion of utility - or ""happiness"" -- a criteria by which to evaluate policy.  Specifically, they argued that social welfare was greatest when the society achieved the ""greatest happiness of the greatest number"", which was to become the formula of utilitarian social policy.  However, the utilitarian perspective still held the state as a ""benevolent despot"".  In the late 19th Century, the ""Italian Fiscalist School"" developed a different approach.  Beginning with the work of Francesco Ferrara, and following through Pantaleoni, Antonio de Viti de Marco, Ugo Mazzola, Luigi Einaudi and others (including, notably, Pareto and Barone), the State began being analyzed as an economic entity itself.  This involved examining the government as both a  ""productive"" agent (i.e. a producer of collective goods -- which are also inputs into private production) as well as an ""optimizing"" agent (i.e. a ""revenue-maximizer"").  They were particularly keen on analyzing  the impact of fiscal policy in this context.  The Italian ""fiscal science"" continued on its distinctive path through the second half of the 20th Century. James Buchanan credits the Italian fiscalist school as the intellectual precursors to the ""public choice"" school. The third distinctive strain of Italian economics has been the remarkable ""Classical"" Neo-Ricardian counter-revolution initiated in 1960 by Piero Sraffa.  Although most of the early action was at Cambridge,  the Neo-Ricardian school took root in Italy as Sraffa's Italian students, such as Pasinetti and Garegnani, returned home.  There it was not only tolerated but even attained a degree of respectability that seemed impossible anywhere else.

Social Philosophers and Commentators," Economists are not always merely economists, concerned with money, taxes and trade, but often wider-ranging political and social thinkers, who commented extensively on things like the nature of justice, property, law, and constitutions, the organization of society and the origin of social mores.  Indeed, up until the professionalization of economics in the late 19th/early 20th Century, it frequently came hand-in-hand.  This page is concerned with collecting writers known primarily as political and social philosophers that happened to also delve into economics, or impacted it more indirectly, by, for example, constructing theories, frameworks of ideas and concepts that would be later borrowed by economists.   The Ancients, the Medieval Scholastics and Islamic jurists were all primarily political and social philosophers, so there is little point re-listing them all here again.  So were many of what we have called the ""first economists"" of the 16th Century.  We refer to those pages for consultation.  The names we gather here is a list of social philosophers from the 17th Century onwards whose works in political science and sociology had an impact on economics and economic thinking.  Naturally, the list is not comprehensive, but we needed a place to collect thinkers, such as as Hobbes, Comte, Ruskin, Durkheim and Spencer, who ideas impacted economics, but cannot themselves really be classified as belonging to any ""economic"" school of thought. See also the pages on the Mercantilists and Enlightenment economics.

The Classical Ricardian School," In the year 1776, David Hume died while Jacques Turgot and Marquis de Condorcet left their government posts.  But, in that same year, the intellectual revolution they had contributed to, the Enlightenment, began to bear its principal fruit.  It was a year of grand treatises.  Adam Smith published his Wealth of Nations, the Abb√© de Condillac his Commerce et le Gouvernement, Jeremy Bentham his Fragments on Government and Tom Paine his Common Sense. But the big event of 1776 was America.  The Mercantilist economic policies of the British state had led to a rebellion and now the colonists established a home-grown liberal republican government more-or-less dedicated to laissez-faire and free trade.  Bigger events were yet to happen.  By 1789, the French State was bankrupt. For the first time in nearly two centuries, the French parliament was called into session, but the bourgeois delegates formed their own National Assembly, put forth their ""Declaration of the Rights of Man"" and made themselves the supreme rulers of France.  The absolute monarchy and the attending system of aristocratic and clerical privileges was abolished.  In a Paris square in 1793, King Louis XVI was beheaded by his own people, while, next door in Germany, God Himself met a similar fate at the hands of a mild-mannered university professor.  And if anybody in Europe had missed out on these events, Napoleon's armies would soon deliver them to their doorsteps.  As Europe descended into a long bloodbath, the delicate, optimistic strains of the Enlightenment began fading away and the bold, brash fury of the Romantic era thundered into existence.  ""The old century ends in a storm, the new one begins with murder..."", murmured the German poet Friedrich Schiller.     All the while, another storm was brewing underfoot, far more fantastic and destructive of the old social order than even the busiest days of the guillotine or the bayonets of Bonaparte.  It came unannounced, on the backs of vagrants streaming from the English countryside.  A few tinkerers had devised a better way to build a spinning wheel -- and civilization was never quite the same after that.  The Industrial Revolution had begun. The Industrial Revolution in Britain has been tentatively dated from 1760 to 1832.   The merchants of Bristol and Glasgow morphed into the arriviste industrial capitalists of Birmingham and Manchester. As ever more dark satanic textile mills dotted the landscapes of England, a series of new battles were enjoined --  cotton versus corn, capitalists versus aristocrats, the bourgeoisie versus the gentry, calculation versus custom, machines versus laborers, philanthropists versus the Church.   The outcome of the battle was predictable. The 1832 Parliamentary Reform Act placed the bourgeoisie firmly in control of the nation.  Defeated at home, the traditional ruling classes withdrew, many of them rebuilding their old privileged lives ""east of Suez"".  The Poor Laws were overhauled in 1834 throwing rural paupers onto the anonymous mercy of the market. An uprooted and displaced peasantry was gradually transformed into a grim, urban proletariat.  Increasingly miserable and angry, the working classes raised a ruckus on the factory floor and took their struggle onto blood-stained squares and, eventually, into the halls of parliament.  Written during the Enlightenment, the central messages of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations (1776) -- laissez-faire, the virtues of specialization, free trade and competition,  etc. -- seemed an appropriate tune for a gentler era.  It did not anticipate the magnitude of the economic and social upheavals that the ravenous industrial era was about to unleash.  Furthermore, it was a muddled and inconsistent book. A new edition, corrected, extended and updated, was needed.   In the struggle for apostolic succession, three names emerged as strong contenders:  Jean-Baptiste Say, Robert Malthus and David Ricardo.  They all had different visions for political economy after Smith.  Say (1803) wanted to take it back towards the French demand-and-supply tradition.  Malthus (1798, 1820) wanted to add a whole new emphasis, away from the obsessive intricacies of ""value"" and towards a more macroeconomic (and ""dynamic"") perspective.  Ricardo (1817) wanted to do Smith all over again, but to do it properly this time. Out of all three, David Ricardo turned out to be the most successful and influential.  With his 1817 treatise, Ricardo raised economics to an unprecedented degree of theoretical sophistication.  Ricardo's theory, the most clearly and consistently formalized of them all, became the Classical system.   Classical Pillars The building blocks of the Classical system, however, were initially set up by Robert Malthus, the first academic economist in England.  His 1798 Essay on Population was the first cannonade of this pessimistic age.  Holding the axiom that natural population growth exceeds economic growth, Malthus's theory implied a terrible ""wage-fertility"" dynamic, i.e. any increases in per capita income will only induce an increase in population which will dilute it completely.  Attempts to improve the lot of the poor, Malthus argued, are ultimately self-defeating.  This would become the ""iron law of wages"" of the Ricardian school. In 1810, in the course of a public debate over the resumption of gold convertibility (the ""Bullionist"" controversy), Malthus came in contact with the London stockbrocker, David Ricardo and friendship (and competition) was struck up between the two men.  It was during the course of this debate that the Classical perspective on money was developed.   Reversing the Quantity Theory, they argued that the value of money was determined by the inherent costs of producing gold and silver, with the quantity of money adjusting to match it. The third building block, the differential theory of rent, was introduced in 1815, in the course of a debate on the Corn Laws (prohibiting the importation of grain into England).  The theory of rent had been earlier advocated by Dr. James Anderson, but was independently resurrected by four different authors -- Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, Edward West and Robert Torrens -- in the space of one month (February, 1815).  The theory proposed that agriculture exhibited diminishing returns to cultivation.  With real wages set by the ""iron law"", profits and rents were determined residually in the agricultural sector.  As cultivation expanded, they argued, diminishing returns set in, profits would be squeezed and rents grow as a proportion of total income. The differential theory of rent implied a limit to economic growth.  The Classicals agreed that growth was dependent on capital and capital was nothing but accumulated past savings.  But the Classical school also took it as an axiom that only profit income is saved.  Consequently, the squeeze on profits by the expansion of cultivation would drive savings down and thus put a brake on economic growth.  Ricardo referred to this no-growth endpoint as the ""stationary state"" of the economy.  They regarded this as inevitable, even while acknowledging that trade and technical progress might postpone the day of reckoning.  Critical to Ricardo's exposition was to shift the blame for rising prices away from wages.  Wages don't determine prices.  The causality, he insisted, is in reverse: prices determine wages.   The only effect an independent rise in wages will have is to reduce profits -- and even that is temporary, given the Malthusian wage-fertility dynamics. But, as Malthus pointed out, this left the question ""what determines prices?"" hanging.  Ricardo set out to answer that question in his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817), which became the fundamental treatise of the Classical School.  Adamant that prices were independent of income distribution, Ricardo eschewed Adam Smith's ""labor-commanded"" theory of value (to which Malthus was partial) and embraced his ""labor-embodied"" theory of value instead.  Prices -- at least in the long-run -- are purely determined by labor costs, measured not in terms of money (i.e. wages x labor hours), but in actual physical terms (labor hours alone).  There were some theoretical knots here that Ricardo was unable to undo -- in particular, a problem arose when different industries employed different degrees of capital-intensity -- but he refused to compromise on his axiom that value was independent of wages.  Instead, he placed his faith that the artificial device of an ""invariable standard"" capital-labor ratio could be  found to ""overcome"" this differing capital-intensity conundrum and save the labor theory of value.  It is also in his 1817 treatise, that Ricardo posits his famous theory of ""comparative advantage"", arguing that so long as nations specialize in goods which they have a lower comparative  (not absolute) cost in producing, there are always mutual gains to be made from trade.  Advocacy of free trade would became a fundamental policy position for the Classical school.  The Political Economists For his 1817 effort, David Ricardo acquired a substantial following in Great Britain.  At the core of the ""Classical Ricardian"" School was the trio of true disciples -- James Mill (1821),  John Ramsay McCulloch (1824 and elsewhere), and Thomas de Quincey (1823, 1824).  They took Ricardo's Principles as gospel and spread the good word.  Mill's entry in the Encyclopaedia Britannica and McCulloch's articles in the Edinburgh Review were particularly influential.in its early dissemination.  The wildly popular primers of  Jane Marcet (1816, 1833) and Harriet Martineau (1834) made it accessible to an even wider public. But they did not really improve on Ricardo's system.  They did not try to ""fix"" some of the problems with Ricardo, e.g. they ignored the ""invariable standard"" question almost completely.  Revealingly, the Ricardians sought to de-emphasize its pessimistic aspects and gave it a more optimistic twist, e.g. Ricardo's reservations about technological progress (introduced in the third edition, in 1821) were laid aside and his theory of free trade given central stage.  Mill married Ricardo's economic doctrine with the political philosophy of Jeremy Bentham's utilitarianism, presenting both as ""scientific"" defenses of free market capitalism.  Benthamites and Ricardians cohabited in the Political Economy Club in London, a monthly conclave which they founded in 1821. The General Glut Controversy Of Ricardo's old rivals, Robert Torrens quickly climbed on the bandwagon.  But Robert Malthus took umbrage on several points, in particular the (im)possibility of a ""general glut"".  Ricardo had taken on board Jean-Baptiste Say's ""Law"", communicated by James Mill,  that while there may be mismatches of supply and demand, there can never be excess supply of goods in general. In his own treatise, Malthus (1820) disputed this.  But he was swiftly slapped down by the Ricardians and his underconsumption doctrine mothballed for another century or so.   The response of Jean-Baptiste Say was different. When he was finally translated into English in 1821, it was too late.  The British political economists had already thrown in their lot with Ricardo, so Say reconciled himself to minimizing the differences between their doctrines.  He participated in the general glut controversy, fending off both Malthus and his French counterpart Simonde de Sismondi (1819).  But on the European Continent, many economists continued working in his tradition, notably Karl Heinrich Rau in Germany and Say's own followers in the French Liberal School.   But Say's approach, setting the labor theory of value to the side and focusing on supply-and-demand instead, was not unknown in England.  The same points had been raised in pre-Ricardian days by the Earl of Lauderdale.  Now, the issue was resumed with a cannonade by Samuel Bailey (1825).  The position was taken up by a small group of English economists, which we have called the Oxford-Dublin school -- Nassau Senior (1827), Richard Whately (1832), William Lloyd (1833) and Samuel Montiford Longfield (1834) -- who tried to move beyond pure criticism to build up an alternative proto-marginalist political economy of their own.  Although advancing independently, John Rae (1834) can be counted as another strand of that development. The Malthusian Debate, the Wages Fund and Free Trade The first item in the Ricardian doctrine to fall away was the iron law of wages.  The doctrine had led Classical economists to be embarrassingly associated with the ""Neo-Malthusianism"" movement of Francis Place (1822) (which included James Mill and his young son, John Stuart Mill among its partisans), advocating artificial contraception as social policy.  Understandably, the Reverend Malthus did not take kindly to this use of his theory and roused himself to write a new edition of his Essay on Population in 1826 which condemned contraception explicitly and emphasized ""moral restraint"" (i.e. voluntary abstinence) as the social policy to be recommended.   The appearance of this new edition of Malthus's book afforded an opportunity for Nassau Senior (1829) to launch an attack on the Malthusian doctrine altogether.  He claimed Malthus's wage-fertility dynamics were neither self-evident nor vindicated by empirical data and sneered at the ""moral restraint"" argument.  Robert Torrens (1829) recanted the doctrine he had earlier upheld.   Michael Sadler (1830) attempted to modify Malthus's doctrine, introducing population density as a complicating factor that might rescue the Malthusian hypothesis on the whole.  But now it was the conservatives' turn to chime in: Thomas Macaulay (1830) and George Poulett Scrope (1831) reviewed and denounced both Malthus and Sadler.  A last-ditch effort to salvage the Malthusian doctrine was attempted by Thomas Chalmers (1832), who tried to explain away empirical irregularities.  But Chalmers was set aside in a series of scathing reviews.  Many, like Scrope (1833), felt the theory couldn't have it both ways. Positing that rising incomes both increases and decreases fertility was evidence that the doctrine was patently defective.  The old Ricardian hand,  J.R. McCulloch (1837), finally buried the Malthusian story, showing by statistical means that fluctuations in the death rate (not the birth rate) were primarily responsible for observable fluctuations in population.  The vigor of the debate over the Malthusian doctrine can be explained by the impending reformation of the Elizabethan Poor Laws.  The Poor Laws provided minimum income supports for the poor, paid for by parishes out of rates they charged on the community.  Classical economists across the board - e.g .Malthus and Ricardo, through Senior and Martineau - had long called for the wholesale dismantling of the Poor Laws. Some argued on the grounds that any form of income supports merely led, by the Malthusian wage-fertility dynamics, to increased population and misery and thus were of no help to the poor anyway.  Others that these income supports discouraged workers from seeking employment and prevented the creation of a national labor market.  This was the position taken by the Whig political party and their urban capitalist friends.  The rural Tories defended them with the paternalist argument that the wealthy were obliged towards the poor, that ruthlessly abandoning the poor to the anonymous,  individual self-seeking competition of the market would rip apart the ""organic"" fabric of English society.  So had things stood for a while.  But the Parliamentary Reform Act of 1832 had changed the assignment of parliamentary seats so that the previously underrepresented Whig-inclined bourgeoisie was now in effective control.  The reformation of the Poor Laws was placed at the top of the agenda. The vigor of the debate over the Malthusian doctrine can be explained by the impending reformation of the Elizabethan Poor Laws.

The earlier Classical economists, Malthus and Ricardo, had long called for the wholesale dismantling of the Poor Laws on the grounds that any form of income supports merely led, by the Malthusian wage-fertility dynamics, to increased population and misery and thus were of no help to the poor anyway.  It is consequently not surprising that defenders of the Tory position, like George Poulett Scrope, were adamantly anti-Malthusian.  So now that the Malthusian bogeyman was slain, the grounds for the opposition were softened a bit.  J.R. McCulloch preferred to see the system reformed, not dismantled.  Nassau Senior sat on the parliamentary commission that wrote the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, replacing ""outside relief"" of  income subsidies with the ""inside relief"" of workhouses (those dreadful Dickensian homes where the poor receiving income support could be supervised and put to work).  The amendment created the national labor market the economists and the Whigs hankered for, but it did not do so mercilessly. But the ignoble exit of the Malthusian doctrine meant the iron law of wages was also gone from the Classical system.  How to explain wages now?  The Ricardians had another theory in the wings -- the wages-fund doctrine -- outlined earlier by James Mill (1821), J.R. McCulloch (1824, 1825, 1826) and even subscribed to by Senior (1830, 1832).  A clarification might be helpful.  The Classicals had all agreed (more or less) that wages were paid out of a previously-accumulated capital fund earmarked for the payment of wages, what they called the ""wages fund"" (denote it C).  In the long run, C = wL, where w are wages and L is labor supply.  The Ricardian-Malthusian ""iron law"" of wages had held that the wages fund (C) and wages (w) were given historically, and thus it was labor supply (L) that had to adjust to make the equality hold (i.e.  L = C/w, where L is the dependent variable).  But with the Malthusian doctrine now gone, the theory of the labor supply was gone.  The political economists resolved the problem simply by assuming that labor supply was a constant and having the wage do the adjusting (i.e.  w = C/L, where w is the dependent variable). It is this latter theory that is known as the ""wages-fund"" doctrine.  Notice that an exogenous increase in C (from capital accumulation) or a decline in labor supply (L) will increase the natural wage rate. The wages-fund doctrine lent itself conveniently to the debate over trade unions.  After a campaign led by the utilitarian agitator Francis Place and others, the Combinations Acts forbidding trade union activity had been repealed in 1824. Union activity stepped up immediately, worrying bourgeois capitalists quite a bit.  The wages-fund doctrine was used to accentuate those fears.  If union activity pushed wages above their natural, market-clearing (C/L) rate, it would force the amount of labor employed to fall below current labor supply, i.e. unemployment.  Worse yet, adopting Ricardo's axiom,  rising wages would not be passed on as higher prices but rather cut into profits and thereby reduce capital accumulation and growth, thus diminishing the hope that future growth might mop up the unemployed.  The policy implications were clear: if unions held back on their wage demands today, capital accumulation can proceed unhindered and expand the wages fund (C) in the future, and that will help achieve the desired wage gains naturally tomorrow without any attendant unemployment..  This conservative implication of the wages-fund doctrine was given great prominence by Harriet Martineau (1834) -- and the wage-fund doctrine was duly accused of being sheer apologism for the capitalist classes.  But some of the other wage fundists were not so quick to bash unions. J.R. McCulloch (1826), for instance, believed that, left to themselves, capitalists had used their monopsonistic positions to keep wages unduly depressed, below their natural C/L level.  Trade unions, he argued, were merely bringing wages up to their ""correct"" level    A third area of policy the Classical economists applied themselves to was free trade.  The creation of Corn Laws back in 1815 had brought the Classical school into existence and their assault on them did not relent.  Picked up by Thomas Tooke in his petition of the  London merchants (1820),  free trade became the cause celebre of the age.  The Corn Laws were relaxed in 1828, but not enough for the free trade enthusiasts.  In 1838, Manchester activists Richard Cobden and John Bright set up the Anti-Corn Law League (ACLL) to work for the repeal of the Corn Laws altogether -- thus the term ""Manchester School"" was coined for the advocates of free trade and liberalism more generally. The Corn Laws were finally repealed by the Peel government in 1846, just as the dreaded potato blight was starting to hit Ireland.   Enter Mill By the late 1840s, the record of the Classical school was mixed.  They had successfully fended off Malthus's challenge on general gluts.   But the Malthusian ""iron law"" had fallen and been replaced by the slippery wages-fund doctrine. But the third great challenge -- on the labor theory of value, by the Oxford-Dublin school -- had not yet been answered properly.   Did it need to be answered?  Perhaps not.  None of Ricardo's followers had seemed to be overly keen about the labor theory of value.  They seemed rather content to give it a dutiful tip-of-the-hat but then slide into loose demand-and-supply reasoning, without worrying too much about consistency.  The wages-fund doctrine was just one example of this.  Few gave any thought or put any effort into resolving Ricardo's conundrum about the ""invariable standard"" capital-labor ratio.  By the late 1840s,Classical economics had become a bit of a theoretical free-for-all.   It is no wonder the Karl Marx would call them the ""vulgar economists"", woolly-minded lightweights in comparison with the refined Ricardo. It was in an effort to stop economics from becoming a mish-mash of theories that in 1848, John Stuart Mill published his weighty textbook, the Principles of Political Economy.  It attempted to restate carefully and coherently the Classical theory fully and explicitly.  There were few concessions to detractors.  The Malthusian wage-fertility dynamics, moribund for the last twenty years, were resurrected and given their central place again, the wages fund doctrine reduced to merely a suitable theory for the short-run.  Mill was uncompromising on the labor theory of value.  He didn't tolerate the challenges of the Oxford-Dublin school, pronouncing authoritatively that ""Happily, there is nothing in the laws of Value which remains for the present or any future writer to clear up; the theory of the subject is complete"" (Mill, 1848: III.1).   All the Classical pillars were reinstated and  reinforced.   Mill's Principles reimposed a dogmatic discipline in the Classical school.  But it also gave dissenters no choice but to go into open rebellion.   By the 1860s, the Classical School was in a state of siege.  The Wages Fund Doctrine, never very solid, was conclusively demolished when F.D. Longe (1866) and W.T. Thornton (1869) forced J.S. Mill to recant it.  Simultaneously, Thomas Cliffe-Leslie and English Historicists launched their crusade against Ricardian theory -- accompanied, from afar, by the German Historical School.  The Victorian ""sages"", Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin, raked the Classical economists over coals in the popular press. Karl Marx (1867) had picked up the Ricardian theory of value and taken it in a different direction.  The death-knell arrived with the Marginalist Revolution led by William Stanley Jevons (1871), Carl Menger and Leon Walras (1874), which finally provided a clear alternative.  The Classical Ricardian system did not last long beyond that.  Some amount of reconciliation between the two theories was pursued (or at least contemplated) by Alfred Marshall (1890).  Other more radical Marginalists, notably Edwin Cannan (1893), concluded that there was nothing in Classical political economy worth salvaging.  By this time, the Marxians had disengaged from these developments and went off on their own course.  Alone around the turn of the century, Vladimir Dmitriev (1898-1902) began taking steps towards solving some of the  more intractable knots that remained in Classical Ricardian theory -- in particular, the ""invariable standard of value"" that Ricardo had groped for.  This was finally accomplished only much later, in Piero Sraffa's remarkable 1960 monograph.  Sraffa called for a rolling back of Neoclassicism and the reinstatement of the Classical Ricardian approach.  This counter-revolution didn't quite happen, but there was a revival of interest and research in the Classical Ricardian tradition which continues to progress today under the banner of the ""Neo-Ricardian"" school.

The Bullionist Controversies," The Bullionist Controversy emerged in the early 1800s regarding whether or not paper notes should be made convertible to gold on demand. This metamorphosized later in the 1840s into the Banking-Currency School debate over the gold parity of the Bank of England notes. Background In 1694, at the instigation William Paterson and the assent of the new Dutch king of England, William III, a new joint-stock company, the Bank of England, was formed to help finance the government's borrowing.  In 1695, the Bank of Scotland was incorporated.  In 1696, a proposal by John Briscoe and Hugh Chamberlain for a ""National Land Bank"", an equivalent note-issuing bank for the English provinces, with credit secured by land rather than gold, failed to get off the ground. Besides lending to the government, the Bank of England's principal line of business was the London discount market - that is discounting commercial bills of exchange. The English currency crisis of 1695-98 lowered confidence in Bank of England notes. To shore up confidence, in 1704, government passed laws making promissory notes legally enforceable.  This did not prevent a crisis and run on the Bank in 1707.  So in 1708, parliament passed an act (7 Anne, c.7) prohibiting private companies with more than six partners from issuing promissory notes anywhere in England.  In 1720, in the course of the South Sea Bubble, the Bubble Act (6 Geo. 1, c. 18) prohibited the formation of joint-stock companies without a royal charter.  The banking act was clarified and reinforced in 1742 (15 Geo. 2, c.15).  England was consequently reduced to a single, note-issuing joint-stock bank (Bank of England) and a myriad of small, private partnership banks which did not issue notes in London.  Outside of London, there was a plethora of country banks which issued notes.. The Bullionist Debate of the 1810s In early 1797, rumors that French soldiers had landed on English soil led to a widespread bank run in Britain. Customers hurried to their banks demanding immediate redemption of their notes in gold bullion.  Several country banks failed, and on Saturday, February 25, 1797, the Bank of England reported its gold reserves were reduced to 1.1 million, and that it was likely to face a bank run when it opened on Monday.   The Pitt government issued an order in council the next day suspending the convertibility of bank-notes to cash until Parliament could address the issue.  After deliberation, Parliament, in early May, 1797, it passed the Bank Restriction Act (37 Geo III, c.45), extending Pitt's restriction until six months after the finalization of a stable peace treaty with France.. The crisis, then, was properly averted, but some commentators believed the government should have restored convertibility immediately after the invasion panic subsided. An intellectual debate proceeded immediately as lawyers, bankers and statesmen lined up for and against the maintenance of convertibility of notes into gold.  On the one hand, there were the ""Bullionist"" group, which argued for convertibility; arrayed on the other side were the ""Anti-Bullionist"" who preferred the status quo of suspension. The Bullionist argument was straightforward. If banks are not required to convert notes into gold, then they will be tempted to issue notes in excess of the gold in their vaults. This will lead to an excess supply of money and hence, by their view, a cheapening of the price of money, i.e. inflation. They argued that to avoid inflation, required convertibility of notes into gold should be restored. Among the prominent spokesmen for the Bullionists were John Wheatley, David Ricardo, Sir Henry Parnell and Francis Horner. In contrast, the Anti-Bullionists appealed to some form of the old Real Bills Doctrine of John Law (1705), Sir James Steuart (1767) and Adam Smith (1776). Given the peculiar, long experience of Scottish banking with inconvertibility, this authorship is not surprising. Banknotes, Smith had argued, were issued by banks in exchange for merchants' bills of exchange. As long as the repayment of these bills of exchange is credible (i.e. ""Real Bills"" as opposed to ""Fictitious Bills""), then no more banknotes will be issued than what is required by merchants. In short, the demand for banknotes by commerce is itself limited by the ""needs of trade"", hence even without convertibility, the bank is not going to issue more notes than what commerce demands. Thus, there will never be excess note issue. If there happens to be excess issue by accident, however, this still would not cause inflation as it would return immediately to the banks upon the liquidation of the bills of exchange.   This was called the ""reflux principle"" and was part of the Real Bills Doctrine. Among the Anti-Bullionists who espoused this doctrine in the early 1800s, we find Henry Boase, Nicholas Vanisttart, Charles Bosanquet, Robert Torrens and James Mill (although Mill subsequently converted to the Bullionist camp after his interaction with Ricardo). Henry Thornton (1802) occupies a curious intermediary position. Although dismissing the Bullionist case for resumption at this stage, citing lack of evidence that excess issue caused the inflation, he also provided an admirable critique of the Real Bills doctrine. Namely, he asked, who guaranteed that the demands of commerce were limited? Suppose actual capital yields returns higher than the rate of interest (or discount) charged by the banks? Would not merchants' demand an interminable amount of notes - however ""real""? Bills offered for exchange into notes, he argued, might not readily be ""limited"" as the Real Bills advocates argued. Inflation must thus ensue. Thornton's analysis formed the germ for the later ""cumulative process"" of Knut Wicksell (1898).  The Bullionist debate reached its climax in 1810, with the establishment of the ""Bullion Committee"" by parliament, chaired by Francis Horner, and including Parnell and Thornton, to inquire into Ricardo's allegations about excess issue.  The Bullion Committee's report concluded that excess issue was indeed to blame for a recent bout of inflation, and recommended immediate resumption to convertibility (Thornton agreed with the report, with qualifications).   However, the report came out too late in the parliamentary session to be considered, and would have to wait a year.  In the interim, a veritable battle took place in the pages of the English press, attacking and defending the report.  In the Spring of 1811, when the report was finally brought up for debate and vote on the parliamentary floor, the act of resumption was resoundingly defeated.  Attention soon drifted, as the new problem facing Britain after 1812 was deflation rather than inflation, and economic debates focused on the Corn Laws. The issue of resumption returned  for a second round in 1818, with the establishment of new committee headed by the young Sir Robert Peel.  It also recommended resumption, and this time it passed parliament in 1819.  Convertibility of paper notes to gold was resumed by 1821. The Banking Debates of 1830s-40s  The financial crisis of 1825-26 and the attendant wave of private bank failures had put monetary reform back on the table - this time focused on the banks.  This had been agitated for by Thomas Joplin since 1822.  Clearly a banking system reliant on a single gigantic Bank of England and a multitude of small, vulnerable, weakly-capitalized, private banks, was dangerous for the health of the financial and payments system so critical to Britain's commerce and prosperity.  In an effort to strengthen the banking sector, the Bank Act of 1826 authorized the establishment of note-issuing joint-stock banks outside a radius of 65 miles from London.  Under the new law, banking companies could have an unrestricted number of partners (previously it had been limited to six) but would not enjoy limited liability.  To compensate for the loss of its privileges (and its profitable rediscount business), the Bank of England was allowed to open branches in the provinces. But Joplin felt that was not enough, and noted that the current banking law did not forbid joint-stock banks to operate inside of London, provided they only took deposits and did not issue notes. The issue was take up in 1833, when the Bank of England's charter was up for renewal.  Much to the Bank's protest, the government inserted an explicit declaratory clause concurring with Joplin, noting it was perfectly legal for deposit-taking joint-stock banks to establish themselves inside of London (3 & 4 William IV, c.98)   It also inserted two other important changes - one making Bank of England notes ""legal tender"" in redemption of country bank notes, another exempting banks from usury laws. Immediately, a series of joint-stock London banks were created - the London and Westminster (1834), the London Joint Stock (1836), the London and County (1839) and dozens more.  But the Bank of England (in collusion with the small private banks) took a stance of unrelenting hostility towards the upstarts, refused to let them open accounts, or use their clearing facilities. The fledgling joint-stock banks responded as best they could, making up for their crippled means by offering high interest rates to their depositors - which could only be paid for, naturally, by a more reckless lending policy.  Predictably, all this unleashed waves of speculation and spectacular failures,  culminating in the Panic of 1837.  In the aftermath, the pressure was on to tighten the system, a crusade launched by Samuel Loyd (Lord Overstone).  It became known as the Banking school-Currency school debates The eventual result was the Banking Acts of 1844, which came into two parts.  The first (7 & 8 Vict c.32, also known as ""Bank Charter Act"" or ""Peel's Act"") prohibited the creation of any new note-issuing banks and restricted those already in existence from expanding.  The Bank of England would henceforth have a de facto note-issuing monopoly. Moreover, the amount of issue would be strictly tied to gold reserves.  The second act (7 & 8 Vict .c.113, ""Joint Stock Banks Act"")  threw up so many restrictions and bureaucratic obstacles that made it practically impossible to create any new joint-stock banks.  And very few were - only three were created over the next decade.  These restrictions would be mildly relaxed in a series of acts 1857-62.  The debates leading up to the 1844 Banking Act pitted the ""Currency School"" (which supported the Act) against the ""Banking School"" (which preferred to retain the status quo), and resurrected some of the issues of the earlier Bullionist controversy.  The ""Currency School"", argued that there needed to be a maximum amount of note issue (which the gold standard provided) or else inflation would result.  They argued that the problems of the 1830s banking system resulted from the fact that the Bank of England's had conflicting objectives, that its note-issuing was tied to its private banking activities, and urged a strict separation between the two.  Note-issuing should be ""like currency"", and follow a 100% gold reserve requirement, completely independently of the bank's other activities (a proposal already made by Joplin back in 1823).  The Currency School after 1837 was led by Lord Overstone and counted among its proponents James R. McCulloch,  Mountiford. Longfield and Robert Torrens. Rallied against the act was the ""Banking School"", who argued that convertibility was enough, that imposing strict note-issuing restrictions and gold parity was unnecessary. Although not accepting the old Real Bills doctrine in its entirety, they resurrected some of its essentials, and argued there was little danger of excess.  The new reflux principle was even simpler: excess note issue might induce inflation, but that would lead to a race to redeem notes in gold, thereby removing the excess money supply.  As a more general point, and a little ahead of its time, the Banking School argued that note restrictions were pointless, since deposits and bills of exchange are effectively also money, and that concerns about inflation are better dealt with by focusing on the restriction of bank credit, rather than note-issue. The Banking School was led by Thomas Tooke, John Fullarton and the young John Stuart Mill. As it happened, several circumstances during this period led to the suspension of the Banking Act three times (1847, 1857, 1866), lending credibility to the position of the Banking School. Nonetheless, the Currency School won the day and gold parity to note issue introduced in 1844 was generally maintained until the First World War.

The Utilitarians,"  Utilitarianism is the social philosophy, legal theory and ethical system, primarily associated with Jeremy Bentham and his followers in 19th Century Britain.   Utilitarianism is founded on the an underlying hedonistic philosophy.   This philosophy identifies pleasure as beneficial and pain as detrimental to a person's ""well-being"".  This is not a tautology.  Many philosophers have quite a different idea about what constitutes a person's ""well-being"".   It is common to distinguish between psychological hedonism and ethical hedonism.  Psychological hedonism argues that the pursuit of pleasure and/or avoidance of pain are the principle drivers of all human behavior. Ethical hedonism, in contrast, argues that people should pursue pleasure and avoid pain, even when they are not inclined to do so.  Although they are conceptually distinct - the first is an ""is"", the second is an ""ought"" - utilitarian philosophers often slip seamlessly from one to the other. The Cyrenaic and Epicurean schools of ancient Greece were perhaps the first to explicitly uphold ethical hedonism.  Both of them saw pleasure as the highest virtue, and pain as the highest vice, but they had their differences.  The Cyrenaics saw pleasure and pain in terms of bodily sensations, and thus as distinct feelings. The Epicureans, in contrast, were inclined to see them both sitting on the same continuum on the mental plane.  As a result, the Epicureans readily defined pleasure as the absence of pain and, conversely, pain as the absence of pleasure.   Hedonism (particularly the Epicurean kind) re-emerged in 17th Century Europe through Gassendi (1624) in France and Thomas Hobbes (1651) in England.   Hobbes, in particular, is most responsible for articulating the strictest version of psychological hedonism.  For Hobbes, there was no need to tell people that pursuing pleasure is a virtue -- that is what they do all the time anyway.  And he asserted it strictly.  Any actions that could be deemed benevolent or social, Hobbes always found a way to reduce them to crass self-interest (e.g. expectation of reward, self-glorification, etc.). Hobbes was very proud of the fact that he had found, in the pleasure-pain calculus, the single underlying spring for all human action.  Alas, the very generality of Hobbes's psychological hedonism was its very drawback - how can we ever prove that someone is not pursuing pleasure/avoiding pain?  Being unfalsifiable, Hobbes's theory was therefore a truism.   On the wider front, Hobbes saw self-interest as socially destructive, and believed the power of the State must be invoked to control it. Hobbes wrote at a time when England was still very much possessed by the Calvinist Puritan spirit, with its underlying currents of asceticism and moral struggles of the soul. Hobbes thesis provoked a reaction from contemporary moral philosophers notably the Cambridge Platonists, who insisted on abstract concepts of justice and the good, and that moral law rests on human consciousness and soul, to be discovered by contemplation.  The animalistic struggle between Hobbesian beings, driven purely by external sensations, leaves no room for an inner consciousness.  Richard Cumberland (1672) expanded Hobbes's narrow meaning of hedonism into a more general ethical precept.  By recognizing that our own pleasure and misery is tied up with that of society around us, Cumberland argued, the primary law of nature is not Hobbesian ""self-preservation"", but rather the preservation of the ""common Good of the whole system of rational agents"" (Cumberland, 1672: p.16).   He dismisses the Platonists' insistence that moral law comes through contemplation - or rather, he agrees with the Platonists that there is an natural moral law beyond Hobbesian instincts, but it is to be discovered empirically, informed by sensations from the world around us.  The hedonic calculus is consequently an instrument for the discovery of moral law, and not necessarily socially destructive. He lauds the equilibrium of forces, forcing man to enter into contracts with each other, as the very key to the preservation of order and the promotion of public welfare and the social good. For his attempt to shoehorn the idea of ethical principles into the hedonic axiom, Cumberland has been rightly regarded as the ""father"" of English utilitarianism.  While John Locke is usually not considered a utilitarian, his inheritance of Shaftesbury's notions is perceptible.  But in his 1690 Essay on epistemology, Locke goes further than Hobbes and Shaftesbury in his assault on Platonism, rejecting inner consciousness and innate ideas altogether, and imposed a strict empiricism.  Locke's philosophy, taken from a moral angle, seemed to be paving the way to ethical relativism. Locke's student, the Earl of Shaftesbury (1699) set aside his tutor's philosophy, and returned to where Cumberland had left off.  Shaftesbury tied it together more firmly with Divine Providence and Design.   The human soul, like the world around it, are part and parcel of the nature, and consequently part of the same design.  Shaftesbury insists man has multiple human motives - man has ""passion, caprice, zeal, faction, and a thousand other springs which are counter to self-interest"".  Hobbesian private egoism is only one among many motives, but there are others, and all have their role to play in the same design.  Shaftesbury gives human consciousness some room - indeed, one can argue he internalizes the external Hobbesian struggle. Internal equilibrium, the balance of motives in the human mind and soul, is no less important than the other balances of natural forces.  The balance of motives is essential, as focus or emphasis on one at the expense of the others becomes internally destructive - e.g. excessive self-interest degenerates to immobilizing fear,  excessive anger into criminal self-destruction, etc.  The early attempts by Cumberland, Shaftesbury and others to show that the individual's self-interest coincides, or is compatible, with social virtue was given a shocking blow by Bernard de Mandeville in his Fable of the Bees (1714).  Mandeville cheekily pointed out that there were more ""public benefits"" attendant to moral vices (e.g. vanity, etc.), than there were to moral rectitude. The Scottish moral philosophers, such as Francis Hutcheson, David Hume  and Adam Smith, contended with Mandeville's challenge, and tried to pin down the origins of human moral sentiments, recognizing they must be made compatible with the animalistic hedonism.  Hutcheson (1725) turned to an innate moral sense, Hume (1740, 1751) to the natural artefact of sympathy and gave moral sense an evolutionary (and relativist) history.  Smith (1759) sought the middle ground, and deployed a more subtle artefact, the internal judge (the ""impartial spectator"").  In France,  Helv√©tius (1758) denounced any innateness moral sense, and posited it all was entirely socially-conditioned behavior, driven by the pleasure-pain calculus.  Helv√©tius enjoyed (?) a bit of a  succ√®s de scandale. Although many philosophers would later jeere utilitarianism as a purely English phenomenon, the roots of utilitarianism, as a program of political and social reform, actually emerged on the continent during the Enlightenment era of the late 18th Century.  It was during this period that the idea of the State as a purely parasitic entity was abandoned. Enlightenment thinkers believed that the State could and should be useful to society. And, unlike Mercantilists, they did not define ""society"" as the ""privileged classes"" alone, but rather decided to include everybody. So, perhaps for the first time, improving the welfare of society was seen as one of the principal goals of government policy.   Following Galiani, many Italian economists, notably Cesar Beccaria and Pietro Verri,  focused their analysis of the impact of the State on the society (including the economy).  While some economists (notably the Neo-Colbertistes and the Neo-Cameralists) saw the promotion of public happiness in terms of political expediency (to keep the masses ""tame""), the Italian utilitarians articulated it as a moral commandment, an end-in-itself.  They were not that much interested in the State itself, but rather viewed it as an instrument to improve the general welfare of the people (whether by engaging or disengaging from the economy; reshaping its laws and practices, etc.). They argued that social welfare was greatest when the society achieved the ""greatest happiness of the greatest number"" (the phrase is due to Helv√©tius (1758)). It was Beccaria (1767) who introduced the term ""social utility"" as the measure by which the evaluate the desirability of a policy and the first to discuss ""pleasure-pain calculating machines"" explicitly.   But it is indeed in its English incarnation that utilitarianism bore wings. Jeremy Bentham picked up utilitarianism from Priestley and Beccaria in the 1770s and gave it its most famous formulation -- often known as ""Classical Utilitarianism"" -- in his 1789 treatise, Introduction to the Principles of Morals.  Betham's early followers, who called themselves the ""Philosophical Radicals"", included James Mill and Francis Place.  The achievements of the Philosophical Radicals were primarily in the practical sphere.  Tireless activists, Bentham, Mill and Place propounded numerous schemes for reforming the political, legal and social institutions according to utilitarian principles.  Some of their propositions (e.g. the secret ballot) were adopted, but most were too radical for their time.  Among their more extreme policy positions was the extension of suffrage to women, the legalization of artificial contraceptives and homosexuality, disestablishment of the Church of England, etc.  The utilitarians varied in their commitment to democracy, some embracing wide-eyed radical republicanism, others believing that a severely authoritarian state was a necessary conduit for utilitarian policies.   Their principal vehicle, the Westminster Review, became required reading among the learned middle classes of England throughout the 19th Century.  Although Bentham was only a partial economist and Ricardo was less than thrilled with utilitarianism, Classical economics (through the intermediation of the Mills) nonetheless forged what Schumpeter (1954: p.831) called an ""unholy alliance"" with utilitarian philosophy.  In its heyday, the famous ""Political Economy Club"", formed in 1821 London, was as much a meeting ground for utilitarians than for economists.  University College London, where Bentham's body remains embalmed and on display to this day, was launched by the same utilitarian activists.    The principal building block of Benthamite utilitarianism is the notion of measurable utility.  Utility is defined as the ""surplus of pleasures over pains"".  Just as temperature can be measured by a mercury thermometer and degree of belief can be measured by a probability scale, the utilitarians believed that the quantity of utility could be cardinally measured (e.g. eating 1 oz. of chocolate yields 16 utils or something like that).  It may seem reasonable to believe that such a utility yardstick exists at a personal level and may even, to some degree, be revealed by personal behavior (e.g. if I choose x instead of y, it is because x yields ""more"" utility than y, and perhaps I can even say by ""how much"" I prefer x to y).   But the utilitarians wanted to go even further.  They believed that utility was not only measurable, but also comparable across people and thus summable.   As a result, the utilitarians argued that social utility ("" general happiness"") can be quantified and expressed as the sum of individual utilities of everyone in society. As John Stuart Mill explains, ""equal amounts of happiness are equally desirable, whether felt by the same or by different persons...If there is any anterior principle implied, it can be no other than this, that the truths of arithmetic are applicable to the valuation of happiness, as of all other measurable doctrines"" (J.S. Mill, 1850).  The second building block of utilitarianism is a consequentialist notion of ethics.  This means that actions and policies are to be judged strictly on how their outcomes affect social utility.   Natural rights, moral absolutes, etc. are tossed out the window.  As a result, we can say ""terrorism is evil"" if and only if social utility is reduced as a result of terrorist activity.  Associated with this is a radical egalitarianism in the computation of social utility.  The utility of a deranged terrorist has equal weight to the utility of one of his victims.   If the quantity of utility a terrorist gains from bombing a subway platform is greater than the sum of the utilities lost by all of his victims, then we must (however reluctantly) conclude that the bombing ""improved"" social utility and was, consequently, ""morally right"". Classical utilitarianism was elaborated by John Stuart Mill, Henry Sidgwick and Francis Ysidro Edgeworth.  They tackled the more intricate theoretical questions and gave it a more formal dress.  One of the more interesting side-effects of utilitarianism was the notion of diminishing marginal utility.  Effectively, this means that equal increments of some good yield progressively diminishing increments of utility the greater the amount of the good already consumed.   This has astounding implications at the social level.  Applied to income, this principle implies that a dollar taken from a rich man and given to a poor man decreases the utility of the former by less than it increases the utility of the latter.  This idea has been used to justify progressive taxation schemes, and, even more radically, for a completely egalitarian redistribution of income in society.  The principle also implies that, for a given amount of goods, the greater the number of people among whom it is divided, the greater social utility will be. Thus, on utilitarian grounds, population growth is usually a good thing: a large society of poor people is better than a small society of rich people (as Paley had argued even before Bentham).  This apparent bias towards equality and large populations was dumped by Francis Ysidro Edgeworth (1879) whom, noting that people have different capacities for pleasure, argued that consistent application of utilitarian doctrine might lead to more inequality.   Diminishing marginal utility was applied to economics in the hands of the early proto-marginalists like Bernoulli, Lloyd,  and Gossen.  But it was most prominently used by Jevons, Walras and Menger, to launch the Marginalist Revolution of 1871.  It has continued to be prominent concept in modern economics (as a brief glance into any economics journal will indicate, all economic behavior is assumed to be ""reducible"" to some utility-maximization logic). Some economists, notably H.H. Gossen, Henry Sidgwick and Francis Edgeworth, were happy enough to take on the Benthamite social philosophy as well.  Others, such as Pareto and Fisher, were sufficiently keen to distinguish the Neoclassical theory of value from Benthamite philosophy that they replaced the term ""individual utility"" with ""ophelimity"" or ""degree of preference"".   W.S. Jevons rejected Benthamitism at first but, later, employed it in his critique of Mill.  The Cambridge Neoclassicals preferred to adopt a watered-down version of utilitarianism.  Alfred Marshall distanced himself from the Benthamite calculus, preferring to fuzzily relate general happiness to the development of character and morals of individuals in a society, and relate welfare to measures of consumer surplus.  Arthur C. Pigou developed the doctrines of ""provisional utilitarianism"" or ""neo-utilitarianism"". He replaced ""general utility"" with the less explicit term ""welfare"" and ""surplus of pleasures over pains"" with ""satisfaction"".  The cost-benefit analysis of the Cambridge school were conducted mostly in terms of consumer surplus and other such instruments, avoiding explicit reference to aggregate utility or utilitarian calculations (the great exception was in questions of public finance, like taxation, where utility was more explicitly present).   The Paretian revolution of the 1930s helped bury utilitarianism as a social philosophy (see our discussion on the ""New Welfare Economics"").  However, in later decades, economists such as William Vickrey, John C. Harsanyi, Peter J. Hammond and Jonathan Riley, resurrected several of the central utilitarian propositions in the language of modern economics.

The French Liberal School,"  The ""French Liberal School"" is how we shall term the 19th Century French economists which followed the tradition, both in politics and economics, set by the theorist Jean-Baptiste Say.  In economics, this meant pursuing a loose sort of Classical School economics while maintaining a prominent role for utility and demand.  They also eschewed most of the Classicals' pessimistic stories about the iron law of wages, the inexorable rise of rents, the wage-profit trade-off, unemployment by mechanization, general gluts, etc., preferring instead to emphasize the happier ""harmonies"" between the classes and the infallibility of a self-regulating system of markets.  Politically, that meant upholding a radical laissez-faire line.  In sum, they can be considered the French counterparts of the British ""Manchester School"" with a dash of better theory and a good deal of optimism.  Karl Marx would later deride them as the ""vulgar"" economists. French liberalism can trace its roots to the Enlightenment philosophers and economists, notably the Physiocrats, Turgot and Condillac.  After the French Revolution of 1789, a group of philosophers and economists tried to re-launch the liberal spirit of the Enlightenment in a republican France that was still suspicious of any intellectual relics of the Ancien r√©gime.  These were known as the the ""Id√©ologues"".  Leading the fray was Destutt de Tracy and Jean-Baptiste Say.  The journal La D√©cade philosophique was their principal organ.  The rise of the imperial regime of Napoleon Bonaparte, who sought to create a ""war economy"" buffeted by protectionism and regulation, led to the suppression of the id√©ologues.  However, after 1815, the restored Bourbon rulers showered the remnants of the liberals with honors and dignities, initiating a long tradition of intimacy between the liberal school and the French establishment.  However, many liberals (notably Charles Comte and Charles Dunoyer) were discontented with the illiberal tendencies of the Bourbons and supported the 1830 July Revolution.  The liberals' greatest competitors during this era were the early French socialists -- notably, Sismondi.  The amorphous doctrines of Saint-Simon hovered between the two camps.   Around the middle of the 19th Century, the French liberal banner was carried by a group of academics and writers whom we shall collectively refer to as the ""journalistes"" (they were also known as the ""laissez-faire ultras"" or the ""Paris Group"").  In 1842, they founded the Soci√©t√© d'√âconomie Politique and the highly-influential Journal des √©conomistes.  They had a powerful ally in the publishing house of Guillaumin, which produced Coquelin's famous Dictionnaire d'√©conomie politique (1852), restating economic debates from a liberal slant.  Guillaumin also put out reprints and translations of older famous economic tracts. The central figures of the journaliste movement include Michel Chevalier, Jean-Gustave Courcelle-Seneuil and Gustave de Molinari. Their advocacy of laissez-faire economic policy was just as extreme (if not more) than their Anglo-Saxon counterparts and their influence on government policy was unmatched anywhere else.   It was during this time that popular laissez-faire satirist Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat had his greatest hits.  But in the battle for the hearts and minds of the French population, their socialist rivals registered some success by painting the liberals as stooges of the corrupt Orleanist regime.  However, the socialists themselves were discredited by the debacle of 1848 and virtually disappeared off the map with the formation of the Second Empire under Napoleon III.  The journalistes (especially the younger Says) were initially wary of Napoleon III, whom they regarded as a populist dictator. But Chevalier ingratiated himself quickly with the new regime, and gradually brought the others over. Any misgivings over the new emperor fell away when he approved the 1860 Cobden-Chevalier treaty with Britain, followed up quickly by treaties with Belgium, Germany, Italy, etc. achieving in a couple of years what generations of liberals had been agitating for decades: the spread of free trade across Europe. The journalistes exercised an iron grip over the economics profession during the Orleanist period and the Second Empire. Most positions in French universities were filled by orthodox liberals.  The prestigious research perch at the Coll√®ge de France remained in their hands from its creation in 1831 until the next century -- passing from J.B. Say to Rossi to Chevalier to Leroy-Beaulieu.  They also controlled the economics section of the all-powerful Institut de France, the academy of sciences that looms over so much of French intellectual life.  We should also note that, already by the 1830s, the French Liberal School had jettisoned serious economic theory.  Most of the journalistes focused on the art of economic policy, allowing a loose sort ""supply-and-demand"" logic to guide their thinking without adhering to any specific foundations.  Serious economic theory -- especially of the mathematical kind -- was pursued by lone figures such as Augustin Cournot, Auguste Walras and L√©on Walras.  But the liberal school did approve this on methodological grounds.  Their concerted assault on Cournot and Walras (p√®re and fils) crushed these men in the academic press and drove their works to the fringes.  The socialist-leaning French engineer-economists, like Jules Dupuit, Fr√©d√©ric Le Play and √âmile Cheysson, were spared only because they were safely sheltered in the grandes √©coles, the only academic institutions not controlled by the orthodox liberals.   The liberals' fall from grace came soon after 1878, when chairs in political economy were established in law faculties throughout France. These were filled mostly by members of the new French Historical School.  Thereafter, French economics veered in an empirical direction and economic policy took on a more corporatist direction.   The Journal des economistes's monopoly was broken in 1887 by the considerably more pluralist Revue d'√©conomie politique.

The French Engineers," (see also the Continental Proto-Marginalists) The French Engineering tradition refers to the 19th Century engineers, many of them trained at the √âcole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©es (ENPC) in Paris, who contributed to economic analysis in the course of their work. France has probably the oldest engineering tradition in Europe.   It was initiated by Louis XIV's brilliant military engineer, Sebastien de Vauban.  Vauban separated his Corps de Genie from the regular army and began recruiting and rigorously training soldiers specifically for engineering tasks.  In 1690, Vauban established a highly-competitive public examination system for entry.  Over time, the corps embraced civil engineering projects like road, bridge and canal-building, flood-control, harbor management and (eventually) railroad construction.  Members of the Corps obtained prestigious and well-paid positions in the civil service during and after their military service.    In 1747, a permanent, training school for the Corps was established in Paris under the leadership of Daniel-Charles Trudaine, the leading French state engineer and head of the inspectors of bridges and roads and Enlightenment figure Jean-Rodolphe Perronet.  It was renamed in 1776 by Turgot as the √âcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es (EPC).  The school was the best place to acquire a rigorous technical education.  It was a magnet for the most capable students in France, and graduates of the √âcole soon acquired a reputation as perhaps the best-trained professionals in Europe.  Given the EPC's success, the French government established several more technical training schools for other branches of the armed forces, such as the √âcole Militaire and the √âcole d'Artillerie.  A mining school, the √âcole Sup√©rieure des Mines (ESM), was established in 1778, on the same model as the EPC. During the post-1789 period, a new university, the √âcole Polytechnique was established.  As designed by Napoleon Bonaparte, the √âcole Polytechnique was supposed to provide the general ""undergraduate"" scientific and mathematical education (plus a dose of republican idealism) for students on their way to the specialized (and now purely post-graduate) technical training schools like EPC, ESM, etc.  In this manner, the Grandes √âcoles ""system"" was set up which completely circumvented the classical route of the traditional French universities like the Sorbonne. After the fall of Napoleon, both the Bourbon monarchs and the July monarchy eschewed the Bonapartist Grandes √âcoles and, instead, doted on the traditional French universities, like the Sorbonne.  Although modernized, the French universities were packed with favorites and subjected to political winds.  In economics, the French Liberal School was given the prime positions in the university system. Happily ignored, the Grandes √âcoles continued to march on to their own drum.

The Marxian School," Soon after the death of Karl Marx in 1883, a Marxian school of economics emerged under the leadership of Marx's inner circle of companions, notably Friedrich Engels and Karl Kautsky, both of whom were German.  However, the Marxian school was soon embroiled in a ""Revisonist"" debate within the ranks - in the humanist challenge issued by Eduard Bernstein against the older materialist interpretation of Marx.  Specifically,  Bernstein (1899) challenged the Marxian notion that the economic breakdown of capitalism was ""inevitable"" and thus if socialism is to exist, it must be a conscious choice, channeled through the political end educational system, rather than a matter of preparing for the ""inevitable"" revolution.  A similar position was taken by Sidney Webb and the Fabian Socialists in Great Britain and Jean Jaur√®s in France. Bernstein's political message was channeled into an economic debate that embroiled the early Marxians on the theory of crisis and breakdown.  In the second volume of Capital, Karl Marx suggested that the number of conditions required for steady-state growth were too numerous for capitalism to avoid breakdown.   Following up on Bernstein, Michal Tugan-Baranovsky (1905) disputed this and suggested that capitalism could achieve steady state growth, so the breakdown of capitalism is not inevitable.  Furthermore, practical experience suggested that, if anything, the capitalism was entering an ameliorative phase in the early 1900s. All the big guns of the orthodox Marxian school -- Karl Kautsky, Rosa Luxemburg, Georgy Plekhanov and  more -- came out against Bernstein and the revisionists.  But the orthodox response was not uniform and itself was transformed in the ensuing discussion.   For instance, Karl Kautsky first replied that there was no theory of breakdown in Marx's work at all, and then, in 1902, Kautsky acknowledged there was a theory of ""chronic depression"" -- not a big-bang breakdown, but rather one that stressed the increasing severity of recurrent crises.  This theory was also expressed by Louis Boudin.   This was followed up by another twist by  Rosa Luxemburg (1913).  Effectively, she argued that it was not obvious what ""surplus-accumulation"" was supposed to achieve, particularly if there was nobody to buy the goods produced by expanded production and thus realize the surplus.   ""Where is the demand for the goods?"" she asked over and over again. In her critique of the Marxian system, she argued that crisis is inevitable in a closed system, but that in an open system (i.e. a system with exogenous consumption), the crises can be averted by obtaining new buyers in non-capitalist  countries.   Imperialism, she argued, was the competition of capitalist nations for precisely these consumers.  Both Vladimir I. Lenin (1916) and Nikolai Bukharin (1917) disagreed with Luxemburg's theory and provided their own view of imperialism.  Imperialism, they argued, is the outcome of capitalist competition for profit rents, not necessarily the outcome of crisis avoidance.  They regarded the First World War precisely as a ""hot"" version of competitive capitalism.   The revisionist debate energized a group of Viennese lawyers and scholars, the famous Austro-Marxists -- Max Adler, Otto Bauer, Rufold Hilferding and Karl Renner.  In contrast to the Germans, the Austrians were less concerned with the issue of revolutionary strategy and more with the issue of the Marxian theoretical analysis. This permitted them to embrace a quasi-revisionist attitude. The Austro-Marxists were particularly inspired by neo-Kantian philosophy of science and the then-nascent positivist philosophy that was the rage in Vienna.   In the Austro-Marxian perspective, the Marxian system was a system of sociological enquiry, or rather, a system of economic theory which was embedded in a more general social theory which itself gave a central position to economic relationships. [The so-called ""Western Marxism"" that emerged in the 1920s with the work of Georg Lukacs (1923) and the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse, etc.) of sociology, was partly inspired by this ""sociological"" approach, but moved away from the stress on political economy of the Austro-Marxists and towards the role of the state in society, philosophy, culture and art,  which emphasized the subjective human element even more than any Austro-Marxist ever dared.  But we should not even begin to attempt to cover this here!] The Austro-Marxists were also contemporaries of the then-prominent Neoclassical Austrian School and thus were forced to take the theoretical and economic aspects of Marx perhaps a bit more seriously and to listen to the Neoclassical critiques more carefully.  Of particular importance were the criticisms on the Marxian theory of value by the Neoclassical economists Philip H. Wicksteed, Vilfredo Pareto and, perhaps most formidably, Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk (1896). All these theorists claimed to have detected inconsistencies in Marx's ""labor theory of value"".  In particular, they identified the famous ""Transformation Problem"" of converting labor values into prices of production. The defense of Marxian theory against the B√∂hm-Bawerk challenge was largely conducted by the Austro-Marxians -- notably, Rudolf Hilferding (1904).   It was Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz (1907) who showed that Marx's own ""quantitative"" solution to the transformation problem was incomplete, and provided his own.  In a little known work, Vladimir Dmitriev (1898) had provided another one. The question remained dormant until Marxian revival of the 1940s.  The Marxian school faced two great challenges in 1918 -- the aftermath of World War I in Germany and Austria, and the success of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia.  When the war ended, the economic and political systems of both Germany and Austria were in a mess.  The Social Democrats in both countries were suddenly thrust into power, and these included many Marxians among them. In Germany, a ""socialization committee"" was set up under  Karl Kautsky and Rudolf Hilferding and left-leaning ""reform"" economists such a Emil Lederer, Eduard Heimann, Adolph  Lowe and (surprise) Joseph Schumpeter to handle the transition.  Hilferding went on to serve as Minister of Finance in two SPD governments in the 1920s.  In Austria, Karl Renner became Chancellor (later President), while Otto Bauer  served as secretary of state for foreign affairs (their minister of finance was, once again, Joseph Schumpeter, on whose unlucky shoulders the blame for the  ensuing hyperinflation was placed).   The Marxians in general, and the Austro-Marxians, in particular, were to play an important role in Central European politics until the rise of Fascism in the 1930s. With post-war demobilization, hyperinflation, reparations difficulties to handle all at once and, in 1929, the rise of mass unemployment, the economic challenges were acute and they were much blamed for it by practically everybody.    Furthermore, with the success of the Russian Revolution beckoning the imagination, the parties were riven between those who wanted to aim straight for full-blown socialism and those who preferred a more incremental, pragmatic approach to social reform.  At least after the failure of the German Revolution of 1918, the Marxians, in general, opted for the latter.  To justify their newly-found position and alleviate the fears of the middle classes, they retreated from the breakdown theory and embraced the revisionist idea of socialism being a ""conscious choice"" of the proletariat, not an inevitable outcome.  The great exceptions were  Henryk Grossman (1929) and Otto Bauer (1936) who set forth a new (and more formalized) ""breakdown"" theory arising from underconsumption. With the exception of the unlucky  Schumpeter, the rival Austrian School economists, most of whom had played important roles in the pre-1918 Hapsburg public life, withdrew into the harbor of private businesses and chambers of commerce  and observed the procession of events.   They were particularly incensed at the Social Democrats  plans for nationalization of certain industries and social insurance schemes.  It was during this time that the  ""Socialist Calculation"" Debate with Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich von Hayek erupted.  The Austro-Marxian planners had, on their side, the exceptional abilities of several sympathetic Paretian economists -- notably,  Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner.   Other economists closer to the Marxian tradition, notably  Fred M. Taylor, Emil Lederer, Jacob Marschak and Henry Dickinson,   participated in this debate on the Marxian side. Planning was also the problem in Soviet Russia itself.    In the 1920s, the main debate that emerged was on the relative stress that should be given to industry and agriculture.   Yevgeni Preobrazhensky (e.g. 1922, 1926)  came down heavily in favor of rapid industrialization at the expense of agriculture, via what he called ""primitive socialist accumulation"" (i.e. replacing markets with State trading monopolies on agricultural commodities).  He was opposed by Nikolai Bukharin, who argued that the disincentive effects of appropriation of peasant surplus would lead to a complete collapse of the Russian agricultural sector.   Bukharin's  ""market-based"" New Economic Policy, where peasants were allowed to market and keep the surplus of their own production, was attempted under Lenin in 1921  With the rise of Stalin, the NEP was scrapped, the agricultural sector brought to heel with terror and collectivisation, and State-led industrialization (and Preobrazhensky himself) came back into vogue.  It was really only after Stalin's death in the 1950s that Soviet planning methods were revitalized by the work of Oskar Lange and Leonid Kantorovich via the use of ""Neoclassical"" pricing theory rather than the Marxian labor theory of value.    In Central Europe, the debate that swirled around Tugan-Baranovsky   initiated a tradition of the development of  multi-sectoral business cycle theory which maintained itself throughout the 1920s and 1930s period.  This can be viewed from the prism of Marx's scheme of extended reproduction and/or his theory of crises.  Particularly important contributions are the theories of structural economic growth by Adolph  Lowe, Wassily Leontief and the Kiel School and Grigorii A. Fel'dman's work on two-sector growth models in the Soviet Union.  Michal Kalecki's theory of distribution cycles were developed largely in response to the Marxian debate on ""underconsumption"" crises.

 The American Apologists," The ""American Apologists"" is the only term we could come up to describe late 19th Century and early 20th Century American conservative economists and social scientists.  There had been earlier American economists of considerable reputation, such as Henry C. Carey and Daniel Raymond, of the distinctively nationalist-protectionist ""American System"" that flourished in the 1820-60s.  But, with a few exceptions (notably Penn), American colleges and universities, both in the North and the South, were out of the reach of Careyites and other System economists.  In the hands of academics, many of them clerics, the economics delivered in American colleges (under the rubric of ""moral philosophy"") deviated little from the British Classical School.  The ""Clerical Classicals"" imported their basic economic theory from the British Ricardians, and embraced doctrines of laissez faire and free trade.  But they often also gave it their own twist. For instance, they liked to interpret the ""Invisible hand"" of the market as the ""Divine hand"" of Providence and often carefully substituted the ""class conflict"" features of Ricardian economics with more harmonious conclusions. They also had little taste for the Malthusian population doctrines, and sought to qualify or ignore them. Among the early ""clerical"" school of apologists were Thomas R. Dew at William & Mary, and more steadily Thomas Cooper at South Carolina (from 1825),  George Tucker at Virginia (from 1826), John McVickar at Columbia (from 1826),  Francis Wayland at Brown (from 1828). A modern, distinctive American economics, combining aspects of prior System and Clerical traditions, came into ""being"" in the 1870s with the work of Francis A. Walker.  For the next few decades, the American economics scene was dominated by a loose ""orthodoxy"" which followed on the heels of Walker. This orthodoxy was rather theoretically loose, hovering between Classical and Neoclassical economic theory.  It was in their applied work and policy stance that they distinguished themselves most clearly.   The last quarter of the 19th Century was a particularly trying time for the United States.  Financial panics, agricultural crises, the rise of the railroad and related industries like iron and steel had upturned the American economic landscape.  The concentration of ownership and predatory methods of the new industries -- the ""trusts"" -- had raised a few eyebrows. But so did the agrarian crusades and radicalized trade unions which rose to meet them.  Much blood was spilt in the capital-labor confrontations of the stormy 1880s.  It was also around this time that populist American reformers like Henry George, the Bimetallists and the Progressivists began to get active.  Economists were called on to take sides -- and take sides they did. The American university system, particularly in the East, was dominated by strict apologists for the status quo.  Simon Newcomb at Johns Hopkins, John Bates Clark at Columbia, J. Laurence Laughlin at Chicago, Charles Dunbar and Frank Taussig at Harvard,  Arthur T. Hadley and William Graham Sumner at Yale, all rose to defend the new industrial age and condemn the unions and populist causes.  The provincial universities, with their roots in the agrarian and industrial Midwest, such as Wisconsin and Michigan, had a more progressive tinge. It is important to note that many of the American apologists were were not Manchester School-type liberals, but rather nurtured on ""American System"" protectionism.  The America which was disappearing was already the liberal's dream.  Prior to the 1870s, America (outside the plantation-based south) had a relatively gentle but firmly-rooted capitalist system with small manufacturing and freeholder farms at its backbone and a restrained government in the background.  Capitalism was well-grounded in America.  As John Stuart Mill wryly put it, ""They have the six points of Chartism, and they have no poverty; and all these advantages do for them is that the life of one sex is devoted to dollar-hunting, and of the other to breeding dollar hunters"" (J.S. Mill, as quoted in Mason, 1982)  What the apologists had to defend was the new industrial capitalism -- dominated by prominent monopolistic ""trust"" corporations -- which threatened to upturn this socio-economic equilibrium.  Destitute farmers, ruined craftsmen and legions of immigrants were asked to surrender their dreams of property-ownership and independence, bow their heads and march quietly into the ranks of an industrial ""army"" under the command of self-styled ""captains of industry"" like Vanderbilt, Gould, Carnegie, Mellon, Rockefeller, Guggenheim at al.  The economists had to explain to traditional America, still very puritanical, how the unrestrained greed, predatory practices and ostentatious displays of wealth by the ""robber barons"" could still be ethical.  Popular outrage against ""rent-takers"", rakers of ""unearned increments"" was channeled by populists like Henry George (1879) and the ""Single Tax"" movement.   And, to a population that had only a century earlier fought a revolution against British mercantilist practices, the apologists had to explain why an almost openly-corrupt government should be allowed to use its power to crush trade unions and farmer organizations, place strict controls on the money supply, use regulations to minimize competition among the corporations and throw up trade barriers to coddle them.  These were positions that many a European liberal would have decried.    The American apologists had one peculiarly American feature: a penchant for making appeals to religious and moral arguments to defend the status quo.   They often claimed that the ""eternal laws of economics"" were God-given and just, and that any attempt to meddle with them by, say, anti-trust legislation or legalizing unions, deserved heavy condemnation on moral grounds.  Some apologists, notably William Graham Sumner, were Social Darwinists:  they appealed to the theory of evolution to defend the ""natural laws"" of the economy, that ""delicate organism"" created by free contract and led by ""the fittest"" captains.   Given this penchant for moral piety, the apologists were easily ridiculed by their opponents.  Thorstein Veblen, Henry J. Davenport and Frank H. Knight gleefully skewered the apologists with masterful wit. Although uniquely American in many ways, the apologists had some early counterparts across the Atlantic.  In Britain, Harriet Martineau, Nassau Senior, Herbert Spencer and several of the Cambridge Marshallians took up apologist arguments.  Some of the denizens of the French Liberal School, while more faithfully ""liberal"" than the Americans, nonetheless took policy stances that smacked of apologism.    In the post-Civil War era, the Republicans, under the influence of Carey, were the protectionist and easy-money party, while the Democrats were the free-trade and hard-money party.  Republican political dominance ensured the maintenance of the high tariffs and flexibility on banknote convertibility.  Hard money came to rule with the passage of the act of 1873, introducing resumption into gold specie (but not free minting of silver - thus effectively putting an end to long-standing bimetallism and introducing the gold standard). When the Democrats finally won officer under Grover Cleveland in 1885, American liberals, like Edward Atkinson, Horace White and Charles F. Adams Jr, finally came into their own.   However, the 1870s and 1880s also saw the arrival of a crop of young American academics who had acquired their doctorates at German universities and were consequently schooled in the methods and philosophy of the German Historical School.  This ""New Generation"" of historists included Richard T. Ely, Henry C. Adams, E.R.A. Seligman and Simon N. Patten.   Seeing themselves as a ""new school"" with a more Schmoller-like normative approach to analysis and a state-corporatist approach to economic policy.  They were the nucleus of the American Institutionalist school that eventually displaced the apologists in the early 20th Century. The methodological and ideological battle between the ""old school"" apologists and the ""new school"" historicists came to a head in 1883, with the formation of the ""Political Economy Club"" at Delamonico's in New York City, dominated by apologists like Newcomb, Laughlin and Sumner.  It was made clear that the historicists need not apply.   Richard Ely responded in 1885 with the formation of the American Economic Association.  Originally it was conceived by Ely as an American equivalent of the German Verein f√ºr Sozialpolitik.  Most of the apologists refused to join, believing it to be ""socialistically inclined"".  However, the AEA managed a coup de grace by luring, as its first president, the dean of American economics, Francis A. Walker -- who, having been personally antagonized by Sumner at Yale, had now decamped to M.I.T.   Walker and Ely together performed a conciliatory mission of bringing the old and new schools together.  The AEA subsequently became a more staid professional association.  In spite of the fact that the American apologists had several accomplished, first-rate theoreticians in their ranks, notably John Bates Clark, they were suspicious of another brand of young turks: the high-theory, radical American marginalists, like Irving Fisher, Frank A. Fetter and Henry J. Davenport, who looked to the schools of Lausanne and Austria for inspiration. Interestingly, the historicists tried to rope them into their ""new school"" ranks, but, by and large, they tended to stay above the fray.  For a variety of reasons, mostly methodological, the apologists seemed to have given them little room to breathe -- and neither did the Institutionalists who followed them. American marginalists were scattered in out-of-the-way places and thus, until the 1930s, failed to consolidate themselves into a distinct school.

The Neo-Marxians," During the inter-war period, while Marxism rose as major political force, paradoxically,  Marxian economics fell into neglect, at least outside of committed Marxist circles. After an iffy start, Neoclassical economics was gaining ground, making Classical-derived economic theories, like Karl Marx's, seem apparently quaint and obsolete.  Institutionalism had also robbed it of some of its thunder.  The practical political and economic problems of the inter-war period, the rise of Fascism, the ""Red Scare"" in America (and elsewhere), the widening of Marxian theory to sociology and philosophy, the Soviet-inspired focus on planning, had obscured the economic theory in Marx's work. One can almost say that, by the 1940s, most people (particularly in the United States and Great Britain) had already forgotten that Marx himself had been an economist at all!    In the 1940s, several English-language works by prominent economists began to emerge which took Karl Marx seriously as an economist -- notably, by Maurice H. Dobb (1937, 1946), Joan Robinson (1942) and Paul Sweezy (1942).  This was followed up by two other influential works by Paul Baran (1957) and Ernst Mandel (1962), that finally began putting Marxian economics on the economics map.  The works of Sweezy and Robinson are particularly notable for having brought attention to Marx's theory of value -- thus leading to the re-emergence of the old ""transformation problem"" that had bedeviled the old Marxians. Joan Robinson (1942) was unimpressed and argued that that Marxian economics should do without the labour theory of value -- a proposition that Oskar Lange (1935) had earlier recommended. Sweezy disagreed -- and several prominent economists, such as Ronald Meek (1956), Francis Seton (1957),  Nubuo Okishio  (1963), Andras Br√≥dy (1970), Paul A.  Samuelson (1971), Michio Morishima (1973), William J. Baumol (1974), Domenico Nuti (1977) Anwar Shaikh, Gerard Dumenil (1980), Duncan Foley (1986) and many others have attempted to grapple with the formal and logical foundations of Marx's theory of value.  However, the appearance of Piero  Sraffa's (1960) work on the Classical Ricardian System has led some (e.g. Ian Steedman, 1977) to suggest that the Marxian labor theory of value can be subsumed in the more general ""Neo-Ricardian"" theory.  Sweezy's 1942 book also set out the Bauer model of the breakdown of capitalism, which was subsequently corrected in the formal treatments of Evsey Domar (1948), Josef Steindl (1952) and  Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (1960).  Fel'dman's work on two-sector growth models was resurrected by Alexander Erlich (1953) and Evsey Domar (1957) and were later taken up with gusto everywhere. The work of the Americans Paul Baran (1957) and, later, Baran and Sweezy (1966) was particularly tailored to the post-war boom in the Western capitalist economies, which seemed to invalidate the ""chronic depression"" which the older Marxists had anticipated.  Marx's law of diminishing rate of profit did not seem to be working.  What Baran and Sweezy proposed was that in situations of monopoly capitalism there is no such tendency as prices are based on ""mark-up"".  Consequently, the source of crises is in the tendency for a rise in surplus.  Under monopoly capitalism, there is a need for an external source of demand and profitable outlets for investment.  This makes monopoly capitalism more aggressively outwardly looking than competitive capitalism.  It is on this basis that Baran and Sweezy develop their distinct theory of imperialism and center-periphery dependency which accounts for the state of economic underdevelopment in the world today.  In France, Ernest Mandel (1962) sought to embed to source of crises not in the rise of surplus but in the law of diminishing profit rate over Kondratiev long waves.  Profit rates, he claims, determine the rate of accumulation, and the rate of accumulation generates the waves.  The line which Baran, Sweezy and Mandel initiated  is sometimes called ""Neo-Marxist"" school or simply ""Radical Political Economy"", which broke open a tidal wave of work in the 1960s and 1970s.  The main channels was the New Left Review, the Monthly Review Press, and later on, the Review of Radical Political Economy.  There have been numerous ""offshoot"" Neo-Marxist schools which have taken on many of the themes and conclusions of the Marxian school, although they should not be considered rigorous applications of classical Marxian theory.  We note only the related ""Dependency School"" of development associated with Raul Pr√©bisch and Andre Gunder Frank, the ""World Systems"" school associated with Immanuel Wallerstein and the work on radical political economy of David M. Gordon, Samuel Bowles, Herbert Gintis and others.  A separate (and unrelated) school is the ""Analytical Marxian"" school, normally associated with the work of John E. Roemer and John Elster, which attempts to reduce some of the Marxian propositions to conventional, methodological individualism (i.e. with utility-maximizing rational agents, etc.). There have also been post-war developments in Marxian economics in other countries which, although highly influential, have not yet broached the English-languange market.  Japanese Marxism, for instance, has long been a source for traditional work -- indeed, the Marxian school was almost the ""orthodoxy"" in Japanese academia for a while.  Besides Michio Morishima and Shigeto Tsuru, the work of Kozo Uno, Nubuo Okishio and Makoto Itoh are particularly notable.  The work of the French Regulation School (Robert Boyer, Michel Aglietta, Alain Lipietz, etc.)  is a bit more eclectic in its foundation, closer to the Post Keynesians  in its approach.

The English Marginalists," By the ""English Marginalists"" we are referring to early English economists between the 1870s and the 1930s who strayed from the Marshallian and English Historicist schools which were then dominant in the UK.  Many of those on this list could thus be deemed ""followers"" of William Stanley Jevons, in that they articulated a subjective theory of value, adopted the mathematical method of reasoning  and emphasized the radical break with Classical economics inherent in Jevons's revolution.  Thus, in many ways, these ""Jevonian"" English Marginalists were closer to their continental counterparts of the Lausanne and Austrian schools than the more conciliatory variety of Neoclassicism developed by Alfred Marshall and his Cambridge school. See also the British Anti-Classicals for a review of some English proto-marginalists and our discussion of the 1930s  L.S.E. and the Paretians for the continuation of this line in Britain.

The American Marginalists.," There was a varied collection of turn-of-the-century American proponents of the Marginalist Revolution.  The arrival of the Marginalist Revolution to the United States was not quick.  In the 19th Century, American economists were generally suspicious of British classical economics and the French liberal school, viewing its ""free trade"" dogmas as conflicting with their preferred protectionist ""American System"", so it sometimes hard to disentangle American critics of the Ricardian system with converts to marginalism proper.   Among the former we can include Arthur Latham Perry, a proponent of the ""catallactic"" school, and Francis A.  Walker, whose critique of the wages fund doctrine and progenitor of the residual claimant theory of distribution can be seen as clearing the ground for the arrival of marginalism.  Among the latter are Simon Newcomb, who followed the English Jevonian literature from the outset.  And then there are the homegrown marginalists, like John Bates  Clark,  who came to the marginalist revolution quite independently: Clark ""discovered"" the marginal utility theory of value on his own in 1881; he is also credited as the first discoverer of the marginal productivity theory of distribution in 1889 (really, an elaboration of Walker's own).  Clark, like many American academics of his time, was part of the ""New Generation"" of American economists, who went study abroad to Germany.  Most were trained in the German Historicist tradition, and brought that back to the United States in the 1870s and 1880s, which would later evolve into the American Institutionalist School.  But some of the new generation economists came across the work of the Austrian School abroad.  And it is through Austrian economics, notably the works of B√∂hm-Bawerk (who deigned to print in American journals), that the marginalist revolution became familiar in the United States in the 1890s. For a while, it was possible to distinguish between the homegrown Clarkian marginalism and the imported European variety.   Clark did not start off from individual psychology, but rather from a ""collective"" or rather a ""social organism"" psychology (echoing his own German training). Clark limited his explanation of value in marginal utility terms in reference to the value of the national product as a whole.  Clark's ""Social Value"" approach was followed, in various degrees, by his Columbia students, like Alvin S. Johnson, Benjamin M. Anderson and Paul H. Douglas.  European marginalism, particular the Austrian School variety, was forwarded in the United States by Irving Fisher, Frank A. Fetter and Herbert J. Davenport.  Traditionally, the label, ""American Psychological School"" was coined by Fetter to apply exclusively to this particular group.  However, we should note that all of these American authors were wary of the hedonistic implications of the ""utility"" concept.  They all focused on the ""preference"" aspect of economic choice in price-formation, eschewing all explanations in terms of the hedonic calculus of pleasure and pain.  They argued that economic choice was consistent with all sorts of human psychology. The relationship between the American ""Social Value"" and ""Psychological"" schools was not an intimate one. Both Fetter and Davenport attacked the Social Value school for their ""optimistic"" -- or rather, ""apologist"" -- implications.  In this assault, they were joined by the Austrian economists, like B√∂hm-Bawerk (1896), Schumpeter (1909) and Wieser (1914).   Neither the Social Value nor the Psychological School exhausted the varieties of marginalism that would emerge in the United States in the early 20th C.  In Henry L. Moore and his student, Henry Schultz, we have the Lausanne School's ambassadors to the United States.  However, they were far less interested in the controversial questions of utility and value and more in the analysis and estimation of mathematical general equilibrium systems.

The Cambridge Neoclassicals," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by Cambridge University or any other organization. See the official Cambridge University website] The reign of Alfred Marshall at the University of Cambridge represented the consolidation of the Marginalist Revolution in the English-speaking world - but somewhat defanged, as the Marshallians preferred to integrate the works of Ricardo, Mill and other British Classical economists with the radical marginalism of Jevons, which was closer to the Continental tradition of the Lausanne and Austrian Schools. As exemplified by Alfred Marshall's own magnum opus, Principles of Economics (1890) and expounded  in John Neville Keynes's (1891)  tract,  the methodology of the Cambridge Neoclassicals was distinct from the Continental.  This was exemplified, of course, in the work of Marshall's main disciples -- Arthur Pigou, Dennis Robertson and the young John Maynard  Keynes.  They relied on practical, intuitive arguments rather than mathematical formalism -- taking into account items such as historical time, institutional and industrial structure and real world phenomena, such as uncertainty, money and business cycles.  Their main focus was on  representative conditions, rather than idealized conditions that the Continentals followed.   Consequently, much of their work emphasised partial market equilibrium, couching their arguments in terms of ""representative"" agents, firms, etc. rather than grand, idealized, multi-market general equilibrium systems. Their synthesis of Classical and Neoclassical arguments, in particular their reliance on the interaction of ""utility-based"" demand and a ""real-cost""-based supply, led them often to a degree of imprecision and incongruity which exasperated formal Jevonian economists such as Philip H.Wicksteed and the Continental Lausanne and Austrian schools.  Within the English-speaking world, Marshallian economics was the dominant form of Neoclassicism (if not exactly the general orthodoxy) from the 1890s to the 1930s.  It was a leading force in the professionalization of economics and its establishment as an independent entity in academia. The Marshallian formula was exported to the United States in the hands of the influential Frank Taussig at Harvard and to Italy by Maffeo Pantaleoni. Unlike the more radical libertarians of the Manchester School, the Marshallians nurtured a genteel defense of laissez-faire, albeit with numerous qualifications. Many of them were utilitarians, and thus were prone to judge the free market on the basis of its results, and not as a good in itself. In a sense, Marshallian doctrine was the theoretical articulation of the social, political and economic structure of the late Victorian age, a useful, optimistic antidote to the Marxian and Socialist indictment of that period. Marshallian economics came tumbling down in the 1930s, after Sraffa's damning 1926 critique of the Marshallian theory of the firm, the Paretian ascendancy of the 1930s (led in Britain by the London School of Economics) and, most decisively, after John Maynard Keynes's General Theory (1936). Although previously a leading Marshallian, Keynes turned the young turks of Cambridge itself, and indeed the rest of the world, against the old Marshallian establishment. It can be conjectured that, after 1936, only the (second) Chicago School which emerged in the 1950s still maintained some form of the doctrine and methods of the early Cambridge Neoclassicals.

The London School of Economics.," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This site is not related to or endorsed by the London School of Economics or any other organization. See the official L.S.E. website]  The London School of Economics and Political Science (known everywhere by its ""L.S.E."" acronym) was set up as in 1895 by Sidney J. Webb and Beatrice Potter Webb.  In 1900, it became one of the colleges of the University of London system.   The quixotic philosopher Bertrand Russell gave his considerable inheritance to help fund the L.S.E.   Despite being founded by Fabian socialists, its early appointments were more conservative:  W.A.S. Hewins (later a Tory MP) was its first director,  the outspoken and staunchly Neoclassical economist, Edwin Cannan, was to head the economics department, the technocratic Arthur L. Bowley headed statistics and liberal theorists L.T. Hobhouse headed sociology.  However, the Fabian roots of the school were well-represented in the appointments of  more radical scholars such as Graham Wallas, R.H. Tawney, Lord Beveridge, Harold Laski and Hugh Dalton. The L.S.E. from the very beginning aimed at being an academic teaching-and-research powerhouse.  It was one of the group of ""new universities"" founded at the turn of century which eschewed the Oxbridge-Ivy League ""gentlemanly education"" approach in favor of a more serious academic and technical approach, akin to the Central European model.  Like other ""new universities"", the L.S.E. was keen on raising its profile via academic research. They shocked the old Oxbridge system by creating departments that were hitherto unheard of, like anthropology (under Malinowski) and sociology (under Hobhouse), and by splitting economics into separate ""pure economics"" and ""economic history"" components.  In arriviste fashion, the L.S.E encouraged the formation of professional associations and  journals --  in economics alone, the L.S.E. brought forth Economica in 1921 the Economic History Review in 1927 and the Review of Economic Studies in 1933. Edwin Cannan served from 1895 to 1926, after which Allyn A.Young took over.  Young, however, died rather suddenly in 1929 and was succeeded by the thirty-year old Lionel Robbins, a young economist much influenced by the work of Philip H.Wicksteed and the Austrian School of economics.   The remarkable Robbins saw the L.S.E. as an instrument by which to break the orthodox Marshallian hold over English economics. Under Robbins, continental economic theory (Walrasian, Austrian and Swedish) began to finally infiltrate the Anglo-Saxon world. Robbins himself announced the arrival of this ""new"" economics in his famous Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science (1932) expounding the methodology of radical Neoclassical theory.    The Robbins years were glory years for the L.S.E.  It produced a remarkable group of economists, notably John Hicks, Paul Sweezy, Roy G.D. Allen, Abba Lerner, Nicholas Kaldor, George Shackle, Ursula (Webb) Hicks and Tibor Scitovsky in the 1930s, all of whom went on to stretch and change economic theory in a significant manner.  One of their notable efforts was the resurrection of Paretian general equilibrium theory and the forging of the ""New Welfare Economics"" in this period.  Much of this new activity was channeled into the Review of Economic Studies, a publication founded and run by L.S.E. graduate students. One of Robbins' more daring moves was to bring the Austrian economist Friedrich A. Hayek to the L.S.E. in 1932 as the L.S.E's answer to Cambridge's young star, John Maynard Keynes.  Hayek and Keynes locked horns over the theory of macrofluctuations in the early 1930s, and their rivalry placed the L.S.E. clearly on the map.  However, the Keynesian Revolution did much to entice many of the younger members of L.S.E. away from the Robbins-Hayek sphere of influence.  The fault for this ""disloyalty"" lay in good part with the intransigence of their elders: the deserting students, notably Kaldor, Lerner and Shackle, had made numerous attempts to forge the L.S.E. approach with the Keynesian, but Robbins and Hayek refused to entertain such a merger.   Be that as it may, the L.S.E. heritage of these younger economists remained quite visible, even in their subsequent ""Keynesian"" work. In later years, the L.S.E. continued to travel in its distinct path -- albeit it gradually arranged a modus vivendi with the Neo-Keynesian orthodoxy.  Nonetheless, a ""Continental"" flavor maintained itself throughout, as we see in the work of  later L.S.E. economists such as Harry G. Johnson,  Michio Morishima, Frank H. Hahn,  Helen Makower, Hla Myint, W. Arthur Lewis, Peter Bauer and Ronald H. Coase.        The Early (Fabian) Years  The Robbins Circle Later L.S.E. Figures   Resources on the L.S.E.

The Chicago School," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the University of Chicago or any other organization. See the official University of Chicago website] The ""Chicago School"" is perhaps one of the better known American ""schools"" of economics.   In its strictest sense, the ""Chicago School""  refers to the approach of the members of the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago over the past century.  In a looser sense, the term ""Chicago School"" is associated with a particular brand of economics which adheres strictly to Neoclassical price theory in its economic analysis, ""free market"" libertarianism in much of its policy work and a methodology which is relatively averse to too much mathematical formalism and willing to forego careful general equilibrium reasoning in favor of more results-oriented partial equilibrium analysis.  In recent years, the ""Chicago School"" has  been associated with ""economic imperialism"", i.e. the application of economic reasoning to areas traditionally considered the prerogative of other fields such as political science, legal theory, history and sociology.    The ""Chicago School"" has had various phases with quite different characteristics.  Nonetheless, the main consistent factor seems to be that it has always held a unique,distinct and influential place in the realm of economics at any time.  In the modern day, under the ""Chicago School"" umbrella, we can count various further schools of thought which are discussed in more detail elsewhere:  e.g. Monetarism in the 1960s, New Classical/Real Business Cycle macroeconomics from the 1970s until today, and more recently, the New Institutionalism, New Economic History and Law-and-Economics movements.  Laughlin era The University of Chicago was founded in 1892,  funded primarily by the oil magnate John D. Rockefeller. It was the brainchild of the energetic young William Rainey Harper, then a professor of Hebrew and Biblical Study at Yale, who persuaded Rockefeller and the Baptist community in the Midwest to revive an older Baptist theological seminary in Chicago, which had gone defunct in 1886.  But Harper had in mind the modern ""German-style"" research university model (as pioneered at Johns  Hopkins).  The University of Chicago was chartered in 1890, and its doors opened in October 1892.  Armed with Rockefeller money and a charter which gave him near-monarchical authority, President Harper plundered other universities for faculty - nine university presidents were lured away to take up positions at Chicago, the Chicago science faculty was virtually transplanted wholesale from Clark University. Economics formed a separate ""Department of Political Economy"" from the start - the first separate economics department in an American university. Harper had originally hoped to lure Richard T. Ely (then unhappy at Hopkins), but Ely's salary demands were too high, so Harper turned instead to raiding Cornell.  Harper placed economics under  Ely's ideological opposite, the American apologist, J. Laurence Laughlin, then at Cornell, who brought along a coterie of younger Cornell men with him to Chicago - junior associate Adolph C. Miller, students Thorstein Veblen and Robert Hoxie, and philosopher William Caldwell (who also lectured in economics).  Harvard graduate William Hill was brought in as instructor in 1893, and went on to launch Chicago's program in agricultural economics. Sociologist Albion W. Small and philosopher John Dewey were two other notable figures in the early Chicago years.  Over Laughlin's objections, Harper also brought on board Ely's student, Edward W. Bemis as professor of economics in the extension division.  Nonetheless, a strident socialist, Bemis was shown the door in 1895, notionally for incompetence, but also for Bemis's public criticism of railway owners (many of whom were university trustees and donors) in the aftermath of the Pullman strike.  Pennsylvania heavyweight Edmund J. James was brought in 1896 as professor public administration and to take over the Chicago extension program. Bemis's allegations of mistreatment did not seem to apply to Thorstein Veblen, who was arguably even more radical.  Veblen was saddled from the start with editing the house journal, the Journal of Political Economy, launched in late 1892.  Veblen went on to write some of his most important works while at Chicago.  Despite his radicalism, his notorious distaste for teaching and his scandalous romantic dalliances - ""women liked him, and he did not object"" - Veblen was valued by Laughlin, Dewey and other faculty members.  Nonetheless, it was Veblen's extra-curricular activities that eventually led Harper, over Laughlin's objections, to demand Veblen's resignation in 1906.  Among notable early Chicago students who came under Veblen's spell was labor economist Richard F. Hoxie (who stayed on until his suicide in 1916), Wesley Clair Mitchell (graduating in 1899, he stayed on as instructor until 1903) and Herbert J. Davenport (graduating in 1898, Davenport joined the Chicago faculty in 1900, but disappointed after Veblen's departure, himself left in 1908).  Alvin S. Johnson arrived in 1910, but was lured shortly after to Stanford..  By the example of the pre-existing Divinity School, president Harper dreamed of setting up professional schools to complement arts and sciences. Consonant with this objective, Laughlin led the way in the creation of the ""College for Commerce and Politics"" in 1898.   Initially, it was merely a set of interdisciplinary courses designed for the final two years of undergraduate students intending to take a career in business.  It would eventually evolve into the Chicago Graduate School of Business.  This was followed up by the establishment of the University College of Teachers in 1898 (with E.J. James as dean, until his departure in 1902), the Law School in 1902 and, later on, the School of Social Service Administration in 1919 .  Harper died in 1907, and was succeeded as president of the University of Chicago by the political scientist Harry Pratt Judson.  Laughlin remained in charge of Chicago economics, bringing in economic historian Chester W. Wright in 1907 and Leon C. Marshall in 1909 (who took up the deanship of the Business School).   Despite his personal affection for early Institutionalists like Veblen and Hoxie, Laughlin himself had been dogmatically (Neo)classical (relying strictly on J.S. Mill and A. Marshall), and maintained something of a feud with Institutionalist bastions like Columbia and Wisconsin.  In this respect, the Chicago School's ferocious attachment to Neoclassicism could be said to start with Laughlin - if Laughlin himself had fully committed to marginalist revolution, rather than continued flirting  with Ricardianism. Nonetheless,  an attachment to economic theory was instilled in students like Davenport (who would go on to mentor Knight at Cornell).  But Chicago's eclecticism in the Laughlin years pointed in no specific direction.  The departure of Veblen, Davenport, Johnson and Hoxie's death hit Laughlin hard - like an embittered King Arthur who couldn't hold on to his young knights, Laughlin retired in 1916, leaving the department in the hands of Leon Marshall.  The young Jacob Viner was brought in 1916, and while many mark this as the passing of the torch, Viner did not stay - instead, Viner followed his old Harvard master Taussig to Washington in 1917.  Viner would return to Chicago in 1919, but by this time the luminary figure at Chicago was John Maurice Clark.  Clark had arrived in 1915, and taken over the theory courses after Laughlin's retirement.  Under Clark's influence, Chicago took a more conventional Institutionalist turn, like many other departments in the United States.  After nearly a decade, John Maurice Clark left Chicago in 1926, returning to Columbia.  The appointments of public finance specialist Simeon E. Leland in 1927 and economic historian John U. Nef in 1928 seemed to reinforce the Institutionalist direction Clark had started.  But Clark's successor, Frank H. Knight was to change everything.   First Chicago School The ""Chicago School"" really began in the 1920s with the diumvirate of Frank H. Knight (appointed in 1926) and Jacob Viner (appointed permanently in 1919) taking the helm after Clark's departure.  They were, for the most part, theoreticians (Knight more in the Jevonian-Austrian tradition, Viner leaning towards the Marshallian).  In an age when empiricism ruled most of American economics, Knight and Viner set up the economics department at Chicago as a bastion of counter-institutionalism and, as such, the department soon acquired something of a ""siege"" mentality.    Also at Chicago during this time were the ""Mathematical Trio"" --   Oskar Lange, Henry Schultz and Paul H. Douglas -- economists with a particular bent for the theoretical approach of the Lausanne School.   Younger faculty included monetary theorists Henry C. Simons and Lloyd Mints. The characteristics of the early Chicago School of 1920-1950 differ considerably from the later Chicago School.  They were highly suspicious of ""positivistic"" economic methodology and denounced economic imperialism, arguing for a confined role for economic analysis (esp. Knight).  They were suspicious of the efficiency claims of laissez-faire economics, arguing for it only on a ""non-consequential"" basis.  They welcomed active government policies to cure recessions (esp. Viner's recommendations on ""reinflating"" the economy, and Simons's  ""Chicago Plan"" for counter-cyclical monetary policy), and counted a fully-fledged  socialist in their ranks (Lange).   Furthermore, most of the faculty was not averse to rigorous, theoretical general equilibrium reasoning, but were leading practitioners of the art (Lange, Schultz, Douglas). However, like the later Chicago School, the early Chicago School was hostile to ""alternative"" economic paradigms.  For the most part, they did not welcome the Keynesian Revolution in macroeconomics and denounced the Monopolistic Competition approach in microeconomic theory.  To a good extent, the issues these ""alternative"" paradigms purported to solve, they felt could be handled reasonably well within the confines of Neoclassical theory.  The economics department underwent an upheaval during the 1940s.  Schultz died with tragic suddenness, Viner left for Princeton, Lange left for political life in Poland and Douglas became a U.S. Senator.  Knight, whose interests were moving away from economic theory, went into semi-retirement, handing the reigns of the department over to Simons, Mints and Director. There was a new injection of blood during this period as the department tried to regain its bearings.  The first lurch was towards Walrasian economics.  Several students associated with the departed Lange and Schultz remained -- such as Yntema and Mosak -- and Chicago went on to welcome Jacob Marschak, Tjalling Koopmans and the the Cowles Commission right next door.  The Walrasian period lasted until 1955, when it moved (was hounded off?) to Yale. The 1940s also saw the appointment of development theorists H. Gregg Lewis and Bert F. Hoselitz. These appointments were accompanied by a group of agricultural economists, Theodore W. Schultz, D. Gale Johnson and Walter Nicholls, who had left Iowa State in protest over one of the most famous violations of academic freedom. Apparently, the powers-that-be of Iowa, home of the American dairy industry, had pressured the university to force a young economist to recant a study in which he had concluded that margarine was no less nutritious than butter. Second Chicago School In the 1960s, the department began to congeal into a new shape, led by  Milton Friedman (who joined in 1946) and George J. Stigler (a graduate, who returned to Chicago in 1957)    This is the core of what became the ""Second"" Chicago School, which is perhaps the most famous and polemical one.  Stigler and Friedman were avowed Marshallians, and eschewed the methodology of the now-departed Walrasians of the Cowles Commission.  As the contemporary ditty went: ""I read my Marshall completely through
From beginning to end and backward too
I read my Marshall so carefully
That now I am Professor at U of C"".  The Stigler-Friedman period was characterized by faithful adherence to Neoclassical economics and maintained itself dead against the concept of market failures, reinforcing the Chicago School stance against  imperfect competition and Keynesian economics. Through their influential journals -- notably, the Journal of Political Economy and the Journal of Law and Economics -- the research programme of the Chicago School was advanced and diffused.  It was the Second Chicago School that is often accused of being the modern version of  Manchester School liberalism (or, as some maintain, the more conservative tradition of  American apologism). In microeconomics, led by George Stigler, the guiding maxim in the Chicago approach was to preserve the Neoclassical paradigm whenever possible, never to doubt it. When there is no obvious solution to a particular problem, the recommended course was to extend the Neoclassical paradigm by incorporating new concepts into it that would make the subject matter amenable to economic analysis. Examples of extensions to the Neoclassical paradigm conceived by Chicago economists are search theory (due to George Stigler), human capital theory (due to Gary Becker and T.W. Schultz) and property rights/transaction cost theory (due to Ronald H. Coase).   The Chicago School's impulse for extension of Neoclassical price theory is largely responsible for the ""imperialist"" character of which it is often accused.   Business and finance, previously the prerogative of practitioners and business schools, were brought into the economic spotlight by Chicago economists such as A.W. Wallis, Harry Markowitz, Merton H. Miller and Eugene F. Fama.  Further afield, political science and institutional theory were brought into Neoclassical economics by Chicago School economists such as G.J. Stigler, R.H. Coase, James Buchanan, Armen Alchian and Harold Demsetz.  Economic history were given a Neoclassical reading by Robert W. Fogel and Douglas C. North, while the Chicago Law School (esp. Richard Posner and William M. Landes) used economics to rethink swathes of legal theory.  Perhaps most famously, sociological issues like addiction, family and even marriage were given a thoroughly economic interpretation in the hands of Gary S. Becker and Jacob Mincer. [Naturally, not all the ""Chicago School"" economists are at the University of Chicago, e.g. Alchian, Mincer, North, etc., but it is not unreasonable to argue that they are part of that school of thought.] [George P. Shultz, better known as the Secretary of Labor and subsequently of the Treasury under Richard Nixon and later Secretary of State under Ronald Reagan, Shultz was also professor of industrial relations and later dean of the Business School at Chicago during the 1960s.] [It is revealing that the adamantly anti-imperialist Friedrich A. von Hayek,  who was at Chicago during the 1950s, was confined to an appointment on an interdisciplinary ""Committee on Social Thought"", rather than the economics department proper.  Walrasian theory, which has tended to be of more limited scope, has also had very little presence at Chicago over the past half-century: the only theorist to have successfully infiltrated the Chicago citadel was Hugo Sonnenschein, but then he came as president of the university.  With the exception of the work of Lester Telser, the ""alternative"" paradigm of game theory has also been conspicuously absent until recently.] In macroeconomics, the most renowned phase of the Chicago School has been that of ""Monetarism"" under the leadership of Milton Friedman, its best-known advocate. For the longest time, Chicago was the only school in America not swept by the Keynesian Revolution (the presence of Lloyd A. Metzler  on the faculty was exceptional - Metzler being brought in by T.W. Schultz as the ""house Keynesian"" to balance Friedman). This does not mean that the old Chicago School was opposed to government intervention - indeed, Viner's policy conclusions are at times hard to distinguish from Keynes's.  But in Friedman's Monetarism, it found a theoretical and empirical means by which to begin rolling back the Keynesian revolution. Although prominent in the 1960s, Friedman has always claimed that the main tenets of Monetarism can be found in the work of early Chicago School economists such as Henry Simons.  (see our  survey of Monetarism). Monetarism has since given way to the more mathematically rigorous ""New Classical"" economics of Robert E. Lucas in the 1970s and 1980s.  The quantitatively-oriented ""Walrasian"" flavor of New Classicism meant that the appointments of Robert Lucas, Thomas Sargent, Michael Woodford and Robert Townsend at Chicago met with quite some opposition from the older hands.  Nonetheless, in its policy conclusions and rigorous adherence to Neoclassical theory, the New Classical school remains by most accounts the natural inheritor of the Chicago School mantle in modern macroeconomics. Despite, or perhaps as a result of, its mischievous but always unique perspective, the University of Chicago has taken in a lion's share of Nobel Prizes in economics: Milton Friedman, T.W. Schultz, G.J.Stigler, R.H. Coase, G.S. Becker, M.H. Miller, R.W. Fogel and R.E.Lucas were all on the Chicago faculty when they received their awards.  If we were to add  Chicago-trained economists, the list of Nobelists would expand to include Hebert Simon, James Buchanan, Harry Markowitz and Myron Scholes.

The Monetarists," ""Monetarism"" refers to the school of macroeconomic thought spearheaded by Milton Friedman at Chicago in the 1960s and 1970s.  It was frequently associated, or claimed to be resurrecting, the older Neoclassical Quantity Theory of Money to challenge the Neo-Keynesian synthesis.  Its principal thrust was the insistence that changes in the money supply, rather than changes effective demand, were the primary determinants of fluctuations in economic activity. Its position evolved to articulate the ""natural rate of unemployment"" hypothesis, the idea that government macroeconomic policy, in the long run, is ineffective in altering the level of output or employment. Monetarists advocated the use of rules, rather than discretion, in the conduct of macroeconomic policy, and in particular that the government should not try to conduct counter-cyclical policy, but just let the business cycle run its natural course. During its heyday, the term ""Chicago School"" and ""Monetarism"" were virtually synonymous. The Monetarists were instrumental in breaking the post-war dominance of Keynesian macroeconomics, and setting the stage for emergence of the New Classical school in the 1980s.  See our Survey of Monetarism for more details on this school of thought.

New Institutionalist Schools ," The ""New Institutionalist Schools"" to refer to the collection of schools of thought that seek to explain political, historical, economic and social institutions such as government, law, markets, firms, social conventions, the family, etc.  in terms of Neoclassical economic theory.  New Institutionalist schools can be thought of as the outcome of the  Chicago School's   ""economic imperialism"" -- i.e. using Neoclassical economics to explain areas of human society normally considered outside them.  In this sense, New Institutionalism can been seen as the precise opposite of the old American Institutionalist school, which sought to apply the reasoning of the other social sciences into economics. Although the term ""New Institutionalism"" is usually reserved for the work of Ronald Coase, Armen Alchian, Harold Desmsetz and Oliver Williamson,and others on the transactions costs and the property rights paradigm, it can nonetheless be meaningfully stretched to embrace ""economic"" theories of the non-market social relationships (e.g. Becker, Mincer), political processes (e.g. the ""Public Choice"" school of Buchanan and Tullock), jurisprudence and legal processes (i.e. the ""Law- and-Economics movement of Posner and Landes) and social and economic history (the ""New Economic History"" school of Fogel and North).

The Lausanne School," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by Univeristy of Lausanne or any other organization. See the official University of Lausanne website] The ""Lausanne School"" refers to the Neoclassical school of thought surrounding the Frenchman L√©on Walras and the Italian Vilfredo Pareto. The central feature of the Lausanne School was its development of general equilibrium theory, generalizing and extending the applicability of the Neoclassical.approach to economics.  The Lausanne School has also been alternatively referred to as the ""Mathematical School"" (due to its stress on mathematical exposition) or the ""Italian School"" (given the early presence of so many Italians in its ranks).    L√©on Walras, one of the leaders of the Marginalist Revolution of the 1870s, taught at the Academy of  Lausanne in Canton Vaud, Switzerland, from 1870 until 1893. He was succeeded in his chair by Vilfredo Pareto, one of the leading figures of the 1890s Neoclassical generation.  Although the core of their theories were identical, their emphasis and mode of analysis of these two men were pronouncedly different.  Consequently, one can distinguish between the early ""Walrasian"" and the later ""Paretian"" stages of the Lausanne School.  The ""Walrasian"" approach was set forth by L√©on Walras in his Elements of Pure Economics (1874).  His fundamental tool of analysis was a system of simultaneous market demand and supply equations.   He was mainly interested in analyzing grand themes: the existence of an equilibrium solution to a this system, the stability of that equilibrium, the incorporation of capital and growth and the introduction of money.   However, for many of his Italian disciples, such as Vilfredo Pareto, Enrico Barone and Giovanni Antonelli, the grand themes were perhaps not as interesting as the details.  Put differently, they were particularly interested in the ""microfoundations"" of general equilibrium systems, the relationship between decision-making households and firms and the resulting general equilibrium.  Consequently, the research focus of the Lausanne School moved in a different direction.   As this new direction was announced most prominently in Vilfredo Pareto's Cours d'√©conomie politique (1896-7) and enshrined in his Manual of Political Economy (1906), we shall refer to it as the ""Paretian"" phase.   The Paretians saw the problem as one of ensuring the compatibility of the individual incentives and constraints of consumers and producers in equilibrium.  Thus, they concentrated on analyzing the relationship between demand and consumer preferences, between production and the profit-maximizing behavior of firms.  The differential calculus and Lagrangian multipliers, rather than simple linear systems of equations, were their tools of choice.    From these, they constructed a rather grand ""Paretian general equilibrium system"" -- a system of equations, to be sure, but one where the agent-theoretic microfoundations were starkly brought to the fore.   They replaced all the grand themes of Walras with a single new one of their own: the efficiency and social optimality of equilibrium.   The Lausanne School was not very successful beyond the confines of the small group that surrounded Walras and Pareto.  In England, it was professionally buried under the weight of the Marshallian orthodoxy, while in Continental Europe, the opposition of the German Historical School and its French equivalent prevented it from spreading very far.  They had little chance to break into America either.  The main obstacles were not only their theoretical stance or their focus on an elaborate, idealized economy, but also language.  Their work was mostly written in French or Italian, left largely untranslated and published in relatively obscure locations ((their most prominent organ was the Italian journal, Giornale degli economisti).  Few economists came across it and, when they did, the generous coatings of mathematics ensured that most of them could not make head or tails out of it. However, a few highly-talented individual economists with mathematical aptitude did pick it up.   Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz,  Knut Wicksell,  Henry Moore and Irving Fisher were greatly inspired by Walras's theoretical system.  Albert Aupetit and Karl Schlesinger continued to work on Walras's theory of money while W.E. Johnson and Eugene Slutsky advanced the Paretian ""tastes-and-obstacles"" approach.   Things changed considerably in the 1930s.  In the 1920s, √âtienne Antonelli and Gustav Cassel had taken it upon themselves to resurrect Walras's work from obscurity.  Cassel's restatement of the Walrasian general equilibrium system  sparked some interest on the Continent.  This led to the formation of the Vienna Colloquium in the 1930s around Karl Menger, where mathematicians and economists sought to resolve some of its knottier difficulties.  In America, the publication of Irving Fisher's Theory of Interest (1930) illustrated how one could use a Lausanne-style general equilibrium system to explain macroeconomic issues, while Henry Schultz carried on Moore's task of marrying Lausanne economics and empirical analysis.   However, it was the revival of the Paretian system in the 1930s which proved to be the seminal event.  The main catalyst was the famous 1934 article by John Hicks and R.G.D. Allen on the derivation of demand from preferences.  Throughout the 1930s, John Hicks, Harold Hotelling, Oskar Lange, Maurice Allais, Paul A. Samuelson and many others continued to develop the Paretian general equilibrium system, much of it now in English.  Paretian concerns with efficiency spawned the ""New Welfare Economics"".   Concurrent events, such as the implosion of the Marshallian system under the weight of the Keynesian and monopolistic competition revolutions and the destruction of the European academic establishment by the Nazis, meant that the traditional pillars of resistance were absent.  The foundation of the Cowles Commission, the Econometric Society and two mathematically-unrestrained journals, Econometrica and Review of Economic Studies, helped bring scattered theorists together and gave them a forum.  The resulting spurt of research energy helped conquer many economics departments in the American and British universities for the Lausanne School, giving them a new institutional basis for advancement.   The Paretians would dominate events until the1950s, when  mathematical economics underwent a small revolution in the hands of the Tjalling Koopmans, Kenneth Arrow, G√©rard Debreu and the Cowles Commission.   From this, the modern Neo-Walrasian School was spawned.  Its main achievement was the reconstruction of general equilibrium theory in a manner which reconciled the original Walrasian and Paretian strands of the Lausanne School and gave it a new technical apparatus and scope.   Finally, we should perhaps note that the University of Lausanne itself has changed considerably in the past century.  It has shed a  lot of the mathematical trappings of the original schools and focused on the overlap of sociology and economics, along the lines of Fran√ßois Perroux.  This ""third"" strand of the Lausanne School can trace lines of descendence from Walras's and Pareto's work.

The Austrian School,"The ""Austrian School"" (also known as the ""Vienna School"") emerged around one of the pioneers of the 1871 Marginalist Revolution, Carl Menger at the University of Vienna.   The ""First"" Generation of the Austrian School was composed of a pair Austrian professors who, although not directly students of Menger, were nonetheless heavily influenced by him: Friedrich von Wieser and Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk.   It was they who, for the most part, spread the Austrian School gospel throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire and trained the next two generations. These later generations were dominated by the figures of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich von Hayek, with Joseph Schumpeter having departed rather early for more Walrasian pastures. The Austrian School maintained its base in Vienna until the 1930s, when most of its members moved or were exiled to Great Britain and the United States.  Already in Wieser and B√∂hm-Bawerk, we find the principal features of Austrian School economics, many of which became clearer and more distinctive in the hands of their students, particularly Mises and Hayek.  These can be generally enumerated as follows (with a note, in parenthesis, on their main disputants): Some may wish to underline other quintessentially Austrian characteristics, but the listed features seem to capture their more important contributions. As we can see from this list, throughout much of its history, the Austrian School has been in recurrent and continuous engagement in numerous debates with other schools of economic theory over a wide assortment of issues.  This ""abrasive"" nature of the Austrian School ensured that it would be kept out of mainstream (read ""Anglo-American"") economics but it was also the glue that held the school together and forced it to solidify its distinctive theoretical ideas.  However, we should also remind ourselves that several Austrian insights, such as certain aspects of their theory of knowledge, imputation, capital, free goods, etc., have made their way into conventional economics, although often separated from the rest of their work and thus ""watered down"". After the 1871 presentation of his revolutionary subjective theory of value, Carl Menger was challenged by Gustav Schmoller and the recurrent debate on method (methodenstreit) which ensued between them and their followers divided the German-speaking world almost neatly between the Austrian School and the German Historical School.   Soon afterwards, the next great contributions of the Austrian School were made: Friedrich von Wieser (1889) detailed and expanded Menger's theory of imputation in production and alternative cost, while Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk (1889) developed his own distinctive time-dependent theory of capital and interest.  Colleagues and brothers-in-law, Wieser and B√∂hm-Bawerk taught at various universities (Vienna, Innsbruck, Prague) and were recurrently appointed to the ministries of finance and commerce in Vienna.  As such, the pre-World War I era represents perhaps a golden age for the Austrian School, their member enjoying a professional and social prestige and influence within the Austro-Hungarian Empire that few of their marginalist contemporaries managed to achieve elsewhere.  It was during this period that the second generation, notably Ludwig von Mises and  the eclectic Joseph A. Schumpeter, were trained. The early Austrian School  was to influence economists beyond the boundaries of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  The alternative cost doctrine caught the fancy of Philip H. Wicksteed and Lionel Robbins in the U.K. and Herbert J. Davenport and Frank H. Knight in the United States, who used it to gleefully pound away at the Marshallian Neoclassical orthodoxy.  The Austrian theory of capital brought even more attention: it was quickly adopted (but ""Walrasianised"") by  Knut Wicksell in Sweden and Irving Fisher in the United States, and ignited an early debate with several Anglo-American Neoclassicals, notably John Bates Clark.  Closer foreign followers of the Austrian School include William T. Smart in the U.K. (who translated much of their works into English) and Frank A. Fetter in the U.S.  Throughout the 1890s and 1910s, B√∂hm-Bawerk and Wieser also locked horns with the Marxian school, which was particularly well-represented in Viennese society by prominent figures such as Max Adler, Otto Bauer and Rudolf Hilferding -- the ""Austro-Marxists"" -- over the theory of value, capital, interest, methodology and economic policy.  [Mention should also be made of a small Walrasian seed in contemporary Vienna -- one that includes Rudolf Auspitz and Richard Lieben in its early years and, later on, renegade students of the Austrian School such as Joseph A. Schumpeter, Karl Schlesinger and Menger's own son, Karl Menger, who ran the Vienna Colloquium in the 1930s.  However, in these early years, the Austrians never really confronted the Walrasians in their midst, largely because the differences between them were not yet clear.] Much of this early success came to an end with the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918.  In the new republican atmosphere, many Marxians and semi-Marxians began to take positions of power in the post-war Austrian and German governments and economic institutions. The Marxians pushed much of their more pragmatic economic planning agenda in Central Europe during the immediate post-war period.  With B√∂hm-Bawerk already dead, Wieser approaching retirement and Schumpeter enrolled by the Marxians as a half-willing accomplice, the mantle for the defense of the laissez-faire and marginalist economics fell largely upon the shoulders of  the two new leaders of the Austrian School in 1920s Vienna: Hans Mayer (who succeeded to Wieser's chair in 1923)  carried on the ""Wieserian"" tradition, while the ""Bohm-Bawerkian"" line was picked up by Ludwig von Mises.  The Austrian School's traditional duel with the Marxians took on a new dimension when several prominent Paretians rode into the assistance of the Marxians by concurring with the possibility of an efficient socialist organization of economic society, what became known as the ""Socialist Calculation"" debate.  It was out of this debate that several of the other distinctive features of Austrian theory emerged, particularly the theory of knowledge laid out in the seminal contributions of Friedrich von Hayek (1937, 1945). While Mayer was well-ensconced inside the University of Vienna, von Mises operated on its peripheries, holding only the position of privatdozent (unpaid teacher) at the university, his full-time day job being in the Austrian Chamber of Commerce.  Nonetheless, von Mises ran a successful and influential seminar in Vienna for two decades that would be the true breeding ground of the next (third) generation of Austrian economists. Among the Mises seminar participants, we find Friedrich von Hayek, Fritz Machlup, Oskar Morgenstern, Gottfried von Haberler and Paul Rosenstein-Rodan.  The main topic of the discussion group was not the Socialist debate (""there was no one there to convince"", as one participant put it later), but rather interdisciplinary issues in social science and methodology, thus the inclusion in this group of the philosopher Felix Kaufmann and sociologist Alfred Sch√ºtz. A new issue emerged with urgency in the 1920s, particularly after the Great Crash of 1929: the development of a subjectivist theory of macroeconomic fluctuations. This had been missing in earlier Austrian theory, but Knut Wicksell, who had imported so much from Austria for his capital theory reciprocated by exporting his own monetary macroeconomics to the Austrians.  The Austrian take on the theory of money and cycles had been initiated by von Mises (1912), and the possibility of an Austrian ""macroeconomics"" had dominated the research efforts of Morgenstern, Machlup and Haberler.  The Austrian theory took its more definitively Wicksellian ""monetary overinvestment"" form with the formidable construction of Friedrich von Hayek (1928, 1931, 1933).  Hayek's macroeconomic theory had substantial consequences for Austrian economics.   Firstly, by its employment of the B√∂hm-Bawerkian theory of capital, Hayek reignited a long-simmering debate that had been running between the Austrians and the other Neoclassicals, now with the fiery Frank H. Knight (1933-36) taking up the anti-Austrian banner.   Secondly, his theory led him to be lured by the sympathetic Lionel Robbins to the London School of Economics in 1931, which was to become a conduit for Austrian concepts to spread throughout the Anglo-American world, notably in the hands of Hayek's younger colleagues and students, such as John Hicks, Nicholas Kaldor, Abba Lerner, George L.S. Shackle and Ludwig Lachmann.   Thirdly, the prominence of Hayek's theory brought him, the Austrian School and the L.S.E. directly into confrontation with Cambridge and John Maynard Keynes, an opposition that was made even more acute after Keynes's General Theory (1936).  However, the L.S.E.-Cambridge debate resolved itself in Keynes's favor, at least professionally-speaking, particularly after younger LSE generation - like Hicks, Kaldor, etc. - went on to forge the very Keynesian Revolution Hayek opposed.  Hayek's formidable 1941 Pure Theory of Capital, an effort to restate the Austrian theory of capital and macrofluctuations, fell on deaf ears in the economics world. The Austrian ""de-institutionalization"", Schumpeter's abandonment, Hayek's departure for the L.S.E., and the abrasive debates with other schools exhausted the Austrians by the 1930s.  But the principal misfortunes were political - with the rise of Austro-Fascism, the ascent of the Nazis and finally the Anschluss of Austria with Germany, led to the gradual dispersal of the remaining members of the Austrian School by end of the decade:  Mises went to New York University, Morgenstern to Princeton, Machlup to Buffalo, Rosenstein-Rodan to UCL, Haberler to Harvard, and both Kaufman and Sch√ºtz to the New School.   Thereafter, the research efforts of the individual Austrian School economists began to deviate from each other as well as from the Austrian core.  Machlup proceeded with studies in methodology and knowledge in an Austrian vein, but in his work on monopoly and international monetary economics suggests that he had arranged a modus vivendi with the Anglo-American establishment.  Haberler had an even more intimate embrace with his hosts: his Austrian School background could barely be heard in his work, which was soon tinged with the Marshallian tones of the Chicago School. Morgenstern, always an outsider, took off on a bold new adventure beyond anything his old Vienna professors had anticipated: in collaboration with John von Neumann, he took the Austrian disaffection with Walrasian theory to a new extreme, creating the brand new field of Game Theory in the process.   The old lions, Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich von Hayek, had a more difficult adjustment.  Hayek became a lonely, peripatic scholar, living in interdisciplinary space in London, Chicago and Freiburg, away from the main economic debates and pursuing his own brand of surprisingly novel research and pathbreaking contributions still in the Austrian vein.  His surprising 1976 Nobel prize and the surge of interest in his work after that, vindicated his painful post-1940s career. Ludwig von Mises attempted to relive his glorious Vienna days by setting up yet another private seminar in New York City. Out of this, he managed to forge still another generation of Austrian economists - the fourth or ""American"" generation of the Austrian School - which included such figures as Murray N. Rothbard and  Israel Kirzner.  Mises's  American offspring remained outside the economics mainstream and were corralled into a handful of universities, such as N.Y.U. and George Mason, where many of them are still concentrated today.  The emphasis of the American Austrian school is, as can be expected, on Misesian themes, particularly that of the ""market process"" (versus equilibrium), developed by Mises (1949), although many of the Hayekian themes on information and self-organization fit in quite well.  The ""market process"" theory can be regarded as a form of evolutionary theory.  The Austrian theory of capital was maintained almost single-handedly since the 1940s by Ludwig Lachmann, but was given an invigorating shot in the arm by the formidable effort of John Hicks (1973).   Many other Austrian concepts, such as the monetary overinvestment theory of cycles, were never really taken up again.  Perhaps surprisingly, the Monetarist Counter-Revolution in macroeconomics, which buried the Keynesian orthodoxy and resurrected some of the old Austrian policy positions, did not embrace and was not embraced by the American Austrians.  In spite of the fact that many insights of the Austrian School have made their way into Neoclassical mainstream economics, in spite of the decline of the Keynesian orthodoxy, the Austrian School still retains its distinctive flavor in modern economics.

The Stockholm School," Economics was a relative latecomer to Sweden.  The first chairs in economics were established around the turn of the century in the faculties of law of Swedish universities - notably  David Davidson at Upsala (1899),  Knut Wicksell at Lund (1901),  Gustav Steffen at Gothenburg (1903) and Gustav Cassel at the newly-founded University of Stockholm (1904).  In 1909, the Swedish business community founded a separate 'commercial high school' (:""Handelsh√∂gskolan"") in Stockholm, essentially a self-contained business school or ""school of economics"". Eli Heckscher held the economics chair at the Stockholm SE from the outset (1909). The ""Stockholm School"" proper can be defined as the group of Swedish economists, working in the decade between roughly 1925 and 1940, trying to extend Wicksell's brand of Neoclassical theory from the static to the dynamic, e.g. incorporating anticipatory expectations (Myrdal), intertemporal equilibrium (Lindahl) or disequilibrium sequence economies (Lundberg).  Stockholm school member Ohlin famously challenged Keynes's claim to primacy in macroeconomics in the late 1930s.

The Paretian Revival.," The ""Paretians"" refers to the Neoclassical general equilibrium theorists of the period 1910-1950 who concentrated on the themes outlined by Vilfredo Pareto's Manual of Political Economy (1906): namely, the analysis of individual optimization, market efficiency and social optima via classical programming techniques (differentiable calculus, Lagrangian multipliers, etc.).  Naturally, Pareto is himself a member of the ""Lausanne School"", and thus much of his own work draws upon that of Leon Walras and others.  However, unlike Walras,  Pareto enjoyed something of a faithful following, at least in Italian-speaking circles. Walras's own concerns - e.g. existence and stability of equilibrium - took a very different route.  It was largely ignored during this time period and only really took off in the 1950s, during what we refer to as the ""Neo-Walrasian"" phase of general equilibrium theory.  In contrast, Pareto's research program, channeled primarily by Enrico Barone (1908, 1912), was taken up in the first half of the century, particularly in the Giornale degli economisti.   The Paretian Revival reached its height of activity in the 1930s and 1940s, through John Hicks, Paul Samuelson, Abba Lerner, Oskar Lange, Maurice Allais, Harold Hotelling and others. The 1930s thus represent the ""resurrection"" (or ""consolidation"") of the Marginalist Revolution,  which had begun to run out of steam in the 1890s and was in a moribund state by the 1920s.   It also represents the first time that the work of the ""Lausanne School"" began breaking the English-language barrier. During the 1930s and 1940s, there were at least four discernable locations  that could be deemed to be the home of ""Paretian"" economics during this time period: the L.S.E., Chicago,  Harvard,  and the French planning school.   Much of the Paretian research program is captured in the grand treatises of the 1930s and 1940s: John Hicks's Value and Capital (1939), Maurice Allais's  A la recherche d'une discipline economique (1943), Paul Samuelson's Foundations of Economic Analysis (1947) and Abba  Lerner's Economics of Control (1944).   The Journal of Political Economy was, early on, its main home, but it was given a very big boost by the founding of two new journals, Econometrica and the Review of Economic Studies. The first task of the day was the rigorous derivation of demand curves from individual utility-maximization subject to a budget constraint.  This was a minor concern for Walras, but a central one for Pareto and Barone.  This was pursued by W.E. Johnson (1913) and Eugene Slutsky (1915) and resurrected by John Hicks and R.G.D. Allen (1934).  Grounding these results in preference theory was pursued by Ragnar Frisch (1926), Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (1936) and Herman Wold (1943).  Production theory was also recast in the Paretian mould and derived formally from profit-maximization production decisions by Harold Hotelling (1932, 1935),  R.G.D. Allen (1938), John Hicks   (1932, 1939), Paul Samuelson (1947) and Ragnar Frisch (1965). The use of the calculus and Lagrangian multipliers in Paretian consumption and production theory permitted these components to slip easily into place into a single, all-encompassing ""Paretian"" theory of general equilibrium by the grand Paretians (Hicks, Lange, Allais, Samuelson, etc.).  International trade theory, which often employed two-sector model reasoning, was a particularly fertile ground for this approach -- as we see in the work of Abba   Lerner  (1932, 1934, 1936), Theodore Yntema (1932), Jacob Mosak (1944),  Paul Samuelson (1938, 1948) and others. Yet the most distinctive aspect of the Paretian system was the ""New Welfare Economics"" of the late 1930s, which sought to connect criteria for ""efficiency"" to competitive equilibria.  The first step towards this was the famous ""marginal cost pricing"" principle introduced by Abba Lerner (1934) and Harold Hotelling (1932, 1938), and taken up with fervor by the French engineer-economists.  The greatest result of this research avenue were the two Fundamental Welfare Theorems, originally suggested by Pareto and Barone: namely, that every competitive equilibrium is Pareto-optimal (First Welfare Theorem) and that any Pareto-optimal allocation can be obtained as a competitive equilibrium given an appropriate transfer of initial endowments (Second Welfare Theorem).  The Fundamental Welfare Theorems were demonstrated graphically by Abba  Lerner (1934) and then proved mathematically by Oskar Lange (1942) and Maurice Allais (1943).  Abba Lerner (1936) and Oskar Lange (1938) went on to use the results on Paretian efficiency to pursue the case for economic planning and market socialism in the Socialist Calculation debate with the Austrian School.  Correlated with this debate was the definition of the social optimum, i.e. which Pareto-optimal allocation is ""the best"".  This was the heart of the ""New Welfare Economics"", to which the London School of Economics (L.S.E.) provided its great contingent of scholars, despite the opposition of Lionel Robbins (1934) to such an exercise.  Nicholas Kaldor (1938) and  John Hicks (1939) proposed a new set of compensation criteria by which one could judge allocations that are not comparable by the Pareto criteria.   Criticisms and suggestions for improvements of the Kaldor-Hicks criteria were pursued by Tibor Scitovsky (1941), Paul Samuelson (1950), Ian M.D. Little (1950) and William M. Gorman (1955).  A different approach to the social optimum was followed by the Harvard contingent, via the ""social welfare function""  introduced by  Abram Bergson (1938) and expanded upon by  Paul Samuelson (1938, 1947, 1950), Gerhard Tintner (1946) and Jan de Van Graaff (1957).  Other notable contributions to welfare theory in this time period included Hicks's ""rehabilitation"" of the Marshallian consumer's surplus via compensating and equivalent variations ( Hicks, 1940, 1956), the ""theory of second best"" (Boiteux, 1956; Lancaster and Lipsey, 1956) and  the theory of public goods (Samuelson, 1954). The Paretian school received what was effectively a broad-side challenge by  the ""Neo-Walrasian"" system of Koopmans, Arrow and Debreu, along two fronts.  Firstly, by dispensing with differentiability and placing convex analysis at the center of their system, the Neo-Walrasians abandoned many of the old Paretian concerns which required them, e.g. public goods, marginal cost pricing, increasing returns, etc.  Secondly, Arrow's Impossibility Theorem on social choice orderings seemed to dishearten much of the social optimum literature which had sprung around the New Welfare Economics.   This was not a permanent exclusion: the field of social choice spawned its own literature and items like public goods, marginal cost pricing, increasing returns, etc. eventually re-emerged in the Neo-Walrasian framework, although in a somewhat different dress.

The Vienna Colloquium  ," The ""Vienna Colloquium"" run by the mathematician Karl Menger (son of the economist Carl Menger) in the 1930s, brought together many different minds from mathematics but also the physical sciences, philosophy, statistics and economics.  It was originally set up in 1928, but the main contributions to economics are the volumes 6,7 and 8 of the proceedings of the colloquium (1935, 1936 and 1937), which set modern general equilibrium theory in motion, advancing from its early roots in the Lausanne School. Menger's mathematical colloquium  met bi-weekly on the bottom floor of the mathematics department at the University of Vienna (on Boltzmanngasse), and its early presentations and discussions focused on pure mathematics, notably geometry and topology.  Among the relevant participants in the Colloquium besides Karl Menger, was his students like Abraham Wald and Franz Alt, the banker and amateur economist Karl Schlesinger (then being tutored in mathematics by Menger and Wald) as well as the young economist Oskar Morgenstern.  The polymath John von Neumann made some appearances in the early years. Other participants included assorted Viennese physicists and mathematicians like Kurt G√∂del (who first announced his famous incompleteness theorem in the colloquium).  The proceedings of the Vienna Colloquium were collected by Menger and published as the Ergebnisse eines mathematischen Kolloquiums during the 1930s.  One could argue that the Vienna Colloquium was the product of three distinct intellectual strands: the logical positivist philosophy of the Vienna Circle, the mathematics of Hilbert's ""formalist"" programme and the logical-deductivist economics of the Austrian School. In economics, the rallying point for the Vienna Colloquium was the investigation of metatheoretic general equilibrium systems with multiple, simultaneously interacting parts. For economists, the prototype of such a system was Gustav Cassel's (1918) resurrection of Leon Walras's theory, presentation of what has since become known as the Walras- Cassel model. The critiques set forth in the late 1920s and early 1930s by Frederik Zeuthen, Hans Neisser, Heinrich von Stackelberg on the Walras-Cassel system - particularly in relation to the possible existence of negative prices and indeterminacy arising from the equalities assumed by Leon Walras and Gustav Cassel. Vienna Colloquium participants Karl Schlesinger and Abraham Wald reflected over this puzzle, and presented their papers in the same colloquium session (March 19, 1934, both published in the Ergebnisse of 1935):  Schlesinger introduced the complementary ""slackness"" conditions and  Abraham Wald provided a sketch of how to use them for a solution to the existence problem.  A few months later, at another colloquium session (November 6, 1934), Abraham Wald  finally provided the first ""existence"" proof of a unique equilibrium for the static Walras-Cassel system with inequalities exploiting these complementary slackness conditions and introducing the weak axiom of revealed preference (too late to be published in that year's proceedings, Wald's second paper was only published in 1936).  The Spring of 1937, in the final volume of the proceedings, saw the publication of John von Neumann's (1937) model of an expanding multi-sectoral economy (originally presented in Princeton back in 1932).  Von Neumann's paper was closer in spirit to the Classical Ricardian than the Walrasian general equilibrium world, but it provided a proof of existence via a generalization of Brouwer's fixed point theorem, the characterization of a solution as a saddle-point and the first to specify and exploit programming ""duality"" theorems and slackness conditions more fully.  It is speculated that Wald might have used such a fixed point theorem for another improved proof of equilibrium, presented to a colloquium session sometime in December 1935 (although this paper was never published, and has since been lost).  Another outgrowth of the Vienna Colloquium was the axiomatization of utility theory, the introduction of uncertainty into the theory of choice and the development of the theory of games.  This was pursued by two of its participants, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, in their pathbreaking treatise Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, which, although only published in 1944 while they were both in Princeton, clearly had its roots in the Vienna Colloquium (e.g. Bernoulli's expected utility hypothesis was introduced to John von Neumann through Karl  Menger's 1934 article). The Vienna Colloquium was disbanded in 1938 with the German Anschluss - indeed before that, as Karl Menger and some other participants had left in advance of it, as the political atmosphere deteriorated in Austria .  The sessions came to an end by late 1936 and the last volume of the Ergebnisse came out in the Spring of 1937. Most of its members were scattered in exile in Britain and the United States. Although they remained in contact, it was not resurrected.  Much of its research programme was subsequently taken up in the 1940s and 1950s by the Cowles Commission in Chicago.

The Cowles Commission," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the Cowles Foundation or any other organization. See the official Cowles Foundation website]  The ""Cowles Commission for Research in Economics"" was founded by the businessman and economist, Alfred Cowles in 1932. The Cowles Commission initially found its home in Colorado Springs, and its first research director, Charles F. Roos, appointed in 1934.  The Austrian emigre economists Gerhard Tintner and Abraham Wald found their way to Colorado Springs as research fellows. In 1939, the Cowles Commission moved to the University of Chicago under the directorship of Theodore O. Yntema (a student of the recently-deceased Henry Schultz). Jacob Marschak took over as director in 1943 until 1948, when he passed the reins over to Tjalling C. Koopmans.  Rising hostile opposition to the Cowles Commission by the department of economics at Chicago during the 1950s  led Koopmans to convince the Cowles family to move it to Yale University in 1955 (where it was renamed the ""Cowles Foundation""). As its motto (Science is Measurement, later adjusted to Theory and Measurement) indicates, the Cowles Commission was dedicated to the pursuit of linking economic theory to mathematics and statistics. Its main contributions to economics lie in its ""creation"" and consolidation of two important fields -- general equilibrium theory and econometrics - which were vigorously pursued by its two most famous directors: Jacob Marschak (director from 1943 to 1948) and Tjalling C. Koopmans (director from 1948 to 1954).  James Tobin would become director after the 1955 move to Yale.  From 1955 to 1967, the directorship became a veritable musical chair between Tobin and Koopmans. The Cowles Commission benefited greatly from the great European intellectual migration of the 1930s and 1940s: many economists, statisticians and mathematicians from Central Europe and elsewhere poured into the United States. Many of these, such as those of the Vienna Colloquium were familiar with Walrasian theory and thus the Cowles Commission was an important haven for many of them. General Equilibrium Theory The list of economists who passed through Cowles on the way to establishing Walrasian G.E. Theory is rather large. Theodore O. Yntema, Oskar Lange and Jacob Mosak were early Cowles Commission associates that began working immediately on G.E. systems. The 1944 Cowles monographs on Price Flexibility and Employment by Oskar Lange and General Equilibrium Theory in International Trade by Jacob Mosak are classics of G.E. theory. From its inception, the Cowles Commission had set down links across the Atlantic: early Cowles participants included Ragnar Frisch, Rene Roy and the L.S.E. economists, R.G.D.Allen and Abba Lerner. They were joined in the 1940s by more foreigners interested in G.E., such as Leonid Hurwicz, Jacob Marschak and Tjalling Koopmans. Several young Americans of mathematical persuasion, such as Kenneth Arrow, I.N. Herstein and Herbert Simon, signed up soon after. From France, Gerard Debreu and Edmond Malinvaud, two students of Maurice Allais, joined quickly after. Lionel McKenzie, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and David Gale were also familiar faces at Cowles. The initial concern was the development of activity analysis and linear programming - initiated by the 1937 von Neumann paper and the works of Abraham Wald, both members of the old Vienna Colloquium -- to describe the production side and later the demand side of the economy. The famous 1951 Cowles conference and monograph, Activity Analysis of Production and Allocation edited by Koopmans provides a historic collection of breakthrough papers on this topic. The year 1951 also saw another path-breaking contribution appear as a Cowles monograph, namely Social Choice and Individual Values by Kenneth Arrow, which introduced the famous ""Arrow (Im)possibility Theorem"" and initiated the axiomatic development of Social Choice theory. The early post-war period attracted numerous young economists: Roy Radner, Martin J. Beckmann, Don Patinkin, Franco Modigliani, Stanley Reiter, Harry Markowitz, Hendrik Houthakker,  Helen Makower which were instrumental to the development of general equilibrium theory and its applications to other fields. The year 1959 saw the publication of two more historical Cowles monographs: Gerard Debreu's classic Theory of Value: An axiomatic approach and Harry Markowitz's Portfolio Selection. After the move to Yale in 1955, several more economists and mathematicians became involved in the Cowles project: James Tobin, Herbert Scarf, Martin Shubik, Donald J. Brown, Abraham Robinson, Edmund Phelps, Joseph Stiglitz, Menahem Yaari, Ross M. Starr, William Nordhaus and numerous others. The issue of choice under uncertainty and information was pursued in the 1967 series of monographs by Donald Hester and James Tobin. In 1972, the famous monograph Economic Theory of Teams of Jacob Marschak and Roy Radner appeared, and, in 1973, the Computation of Economic Equilibria by Herbert Scarf. Econometrics: The Cowles Commission approach to econometrics is famous for its concentration on the estimation of large, simultaneous equations models - particularly the economy-scale macroeconometric models enabled by the Keynesian Revolution in economics. The ""identification problem"" was a very early and famous concern of the Cowles Commission as were the methods of estimation and hypothesis testing used today in economics. The Cowles program on econometrics was pioneered in the 1930s and 1940s by Ragnar Frisch, Gerhard Tintner, Trygve Haavelmo, Lawrence Klein and, for a while, Abraham Wald. Other Cowles figures such as Jacob Marschak, T.C. Koopmans, Leonid Hurwicz, Edmond Malinvaud, Theodore W. Anderson, Carl Christ and Herman Rubin were also instrumental figures. Among the famous outputs of the Cowles work was the ""Klein Model"", an essentially multi-sectoral Neo-Keynesian behemoth of an econometric model. After a long pause since 1955, multi-equation econometrics at Cowles picked up again in the 1980s with the work of Ray C. Fair. There are two Cowles monographs on econometrics which deserve special mention, both of which came out in 1950: the Koopmans-edited Statistical Inference in Dynamic Economic Models, the proceedings of a conference which set up econometrics as we know it, and Lawrence Klein's Economic Fluctuations in the United States, 1921-1941, which introduced the world to the Klein Model. Cowles Nobels: Several Cowles associates have won Nobel prizes for research done while at the Cowles Commission. These include Tjalling Koopmans, Kenneth Arrow, Gerard Debreu, James Tobin, Franco Modigliani, Herbert Simon, Lawrence Klein, Trygve Haavelmo and Harry Markowitz.

The Neo-Walrasian School," Only the briefest of outlines is possible here.  For more details, consult our history of general equilibrium theory. ""Neo-Walrasian"" economics refers to the strain of general equilibrium theory (often referred to by its acronyms, G.E. or G.E.T.) that emerged in the post-war period.  Its roots stretch back to the Lausanne School of L√©on Walras and Vilfredo Pareto around the turn of the century.  After a period of stagnation, it re-emerged in two forms in 1930s, one more ""Walrasian"", advanced by the Vienna Colloquium, and another more ""Paretian"" that was championed particularly at the L.S.E., Chicago and Harvard.  The ""Neo-Walrasian"" school which emerged in the 1940s and 1950s in the United States, notably under the auspices of the Cowles Commission, merged these two traditions and endowed it with a new mathematical apparatus of axomatic reasoning and convex structures (notably the ""separating hyperplane theorem"").    During these early years, the Neo-Walrasians, notably Tjalling Koopmans (1951), Kenneth Arrow (1951), G√©rard Debreu (1951, 1954), recast the old Paretian theories of the consumer, production and the welfare theorems, in this new clothing.  The Vienna question, the existence of equilibrium, was proved by Arrow and Debreu (1954), Lionel McKenzie (1954), David Gale (1955) and Hukukane Nikaido (1956), using fixed-point theorems created around this time.  In later years, Herbert Scarf (1967, 1973) would used fixed point-theorems as the basis of  his methods for computing equilibrium via simplical subdivisions, thus initiating the field of applied general equilibrium. Impressed with their initial successes, in the late 1950s and 1960s, the Neo-Walrasians pressed on.  Their subsequent efforts until the 1970s can be divided  to what we call the ""Hicksian"" programme and the ""Edgeworthian"" programme. The Hicksian programme refers to the incorporation of ""Grand Themes"" like stability, uncertainty, money, capital, macroeconomics, growth, etc. into general equilibrium theory, the project effectively initiated by John Hicks in Value and Capital (1939) which, in turn, harked back to the grand vision set out in L√©on Walras's Elements of Pure Economics (1874).  The mathematics employed in this time period were of a different hue and in some ways simpler, not going much beyond differential equations and linear algebra.   In this sense, there was a temporary return to the ""Paretian"" type of general equilibrium theory. Local and global stability of equilibrium was pursued in the late 1950s and early 1960s, notably by Kenneth Arrow and Leonid Hurwicz (1958, 1959) and Lionel McKenzie (1960).  This research project nonetheless floundered under the weight of powerful counterexamples provided by Herbert E. Scarf (1960) and David Gale (1963).  As a result, alternative forms of stability (non-tatonnement) were developed by Frank Hahn and  Takashi Negishi (1962) and Hirofumi Uzawa (1963). The incorporation of capital theory, in the form of an intertemporal equilibrium, was effectively accomplished by Edmond Malinvaud (1953). The incorporation of  monetary theory was pursued by Don Patinkin (1956) but, after some problems were raised by Frank H. Hahn (1965),  the theory of money in equilibrium turned to the analysis of transactions costs and sequence economies (e.g. Hahn, 1971, 1973; Grandmont, 1977).  Travelling along a different path, Jacques Dr√®ze (1975) and Jean-Pascal Benassy (1975) extended general equilibrium theory to the Keynesian macroeconomic realm via the use of ""rationing"" equilibrium, what has been called ""Non-Walrasian"" general equilibrium theory. Sequence economies were also a consideration that arose from uncertainty and information theory.  The incoporation general equlibrium under  uncertainty was initiated via the ""state-preference"" approach was introduced by Kenneth Arrow (1953) and  G√©rard Debreu (1959).  In a series of famous articles, Roy Radner (1967, 1968, 1972) incorporated uncertainty, information and asset markets into sequential general equilibrium theory.   Not only did he introduce the concept of what has become known as spot-asset market ""Radner"" equilibrium, he also introduced information sets and ""rational expectations"" equilibrium.   Oliver D. Hart (1975) noted some problems with spot-financial market equilibrium, while Sanford J. Grossman and Joseph E. Stiglitz (1980) identified other problems with rational expectations equilibrium. The tombstone of the Hicksian programme arrived in the early 1970s, via a series of articles by Hugo Sonnenschein (1972, 1973), followed up by the work of Rudolf Mantel (1974) and Gerard Debreu (1974) on aggregation.  They came up with the dreadfully dispiriting ""Debreu-Sonnenschein-Mantel"" theorem which effectively posited that reasonable underlying economies can generate all kinds of the weirdly-shaped market excess demand functions. The Edgeworthian programme refers to the efforts to examine the relationship between a Walrasian competitive equilibrium and the solutions obtained via alternative exchange process (notably those from  game theory). The mathematical tools of choicethat were introduced in this effort in the 1960s and 1970s -- i.e.  measure theory and non-standard analysis -- were substantially more demanding than anything most economists had been used to. The central effort was the attempt to prove ""Edgeworth's conjecture"", i.e. that the core would shrink to the set of Walrasian Equilibrium if we increased the degree of competition (here formalized as the number of agents) to infinity.   In 1963, Gerard Debreu and Herbert E. Scarf set the ball rolling with their proof of core convergence within the context of a ""replicated"" economy (i.e. arbitrarily large numbers of agents of each type). In 1964, Robert Aumann proved the equivalence of the Edgeworthian core and the Walrasian equilibria when we have a continuum (uncountably infinite number) of agents.  This ""new"" definition of ""perfect competition"" required the introduction of measure theory -- notably Lyapunov's Theorem -- into economics. Edgeworth's conjecture in more general forms has been pursued by other economists since (esp. Truman Bewley (1973), Werner Hildenbrand (1974), Donald J. Brown and Abraham Robinson (1972, 1974), Robert M. Anderson (1978)). Taking a leaf from this experience, the Hicksian themes were rejuvenated in the 1970s.   By upping the mathematical ante, general equilibrium theorists hoping to solve the nottier problems and loosen some of the assumptions which had been made previously. The first major step was proving existence of general equilibrium with an infinite number of commodities.  Capital and uncertainty theory had raised several questions about infinite-dimensional commodity spaces.   The problem of infinite commodities was posed by  G√©rard Debreu (1954) and pursued by Truman Bewley (1969, 1972), Bezalel Peleg and Menachem Yaari (1970), Andreu Mas-Colell (1986), William R. Zame (1987) and many others.  This required the pursuit of infinite-dimensional vector space theory. A second effort was also initated by  G√©rard Debreu (1970).  Namely, from Sard's theorem of differential topology, Debreu proved that although equilibria are not generally unique, they are locally unique, i.e. there is (usually) a finite number of equilibria. The Debreu paper launched the thousand ships of global analysis, which effectively resurrected the differential calculus in economics.   Egbert Dierker (1973) laid down the conditions on (absolute) uniqueness of equilibrium while others, notably Yves Balasko and the Steve Smale, pursued other themes on the continuity properties of equilibrium sets, stability, etc. Attempts to resurrect old Paretian welfare theory were also pursued during this time. Duncan Foley (1970) extended general equilibrium theory to the theory of Lindahl pricing of public goods.   However, as David Starrett (1972) noted, many externality cases imply significant non-convexities in the production set.  Removal of the convexity axiom has turned out to be rather tricky.  However, following a conjecture by M.J. Farrell, Ross M. Starr (1969) proved the ""convexifying"" effects of a large number of firms, each with (mildly) non-convex production sets. (of course, Lyapunov's theorem guarantees convexity in the continuum case).   However, at the individual level non-convexity remains hard to model. Two approaches were developed in the 1980s, one relying on ""non-smooth"" differentials (e.g. Cornet, 1982) and another involving ""integral"" activity analysis (e.g. Scarf, 1986).  One of the results of this research programme has been the resurrection of the old Paretian ""marginal cost pricing"" theorem of the 1930s.    Following the dictums of ""Ockam's Razor"", attempts were made to derive standard results with ever more general assumptions on preferences and technology.   Besides the convexity case mentioned earlier, removal of the completeness and transitivity axiom from preferences was accomplished in one blow by Andreu Mas-Colell (1974). The innovations continued.  New characterizations of competitive equilibrium were also achieved during this time.  We already know, from Aumann (1964) that competitive equilibrium can be characterized as a core with an infinite number of agents.    Later economists characterized equilibrium as limiting cases of other game-theoretic solution concepts, e.g. with the set of fair net trades by David Schmeidler and Karl Vind (1972), with the Shapley value  by Robert J. Aumann and Lloyd S. Shapley (1974), with the bargaining set by Andreu Mas-Colell (1989), for instance .   Unfortunately, these solution concepts are for ""cooperative"" games and, furthermore, require infinite number of agents.  Efforts have been made throughout , while we usually like to think that Walrasian equilibrium is non-cooperative and can be achieved with less than infinite number of agents.  To this end, alternative characterizations have been introduced.  Duncan Foley (1967) characterized competitive equilibrium as a ""no-envy"" allocation.  Joseph M. Ostroy (1980) characterized quite interestingly as a ""no-surpus"" allocation.  A latter-day effort has been to linking it with sequential bargaining theory (e.g. Douglas Gale, 1986; Martin J. Osborne and Ariel Rubinstein, 1994), but much remains to be done.

The Fabian Socialists," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the Fabian Society, the Labour Party or any other organization. See the official Fabian Society website] The British counterpart of the German Marxian revisionists and heavily influenced by the English Historical school, the upper-middle-class intellectual group - the ""Fabian Society"" - emerged in 1884 as a strand of latter-day utopian socialism. They became known to the public firstly through Sidney Webb's Facts for Socialists (1884) and then through the famous Fabian Essays in Socialism (1889) written by the Fabian ""inner circle"". The ""Fabians"" were named after Fabius, the famous Roman general which opposed Hannibal as they were ""biding their time"" until they would ""strike hard"".  Exactly when this strike would occur was a perennial question.   Eschewing the revolutionary tactics of more orthodox Marxians, the middle-class Fabians were more directly involved with politics and practical gains - through contacts not only in the ""International Labor Party"", trade unions and cooperative movements but also throughout the entire British political apparatus (Liberals and Tories included). At the core of the Fabian Society were the Webbs - Sidney J. Webb and his wife, Beatrice Potter Webb (married 1892). Together, they wrote numerous studies of industrial Britain, alternative economic arrangements (esp. cooperatives) and pamphlets for political reform. At the core of their system was the Ricardian theory of rent which they applied to capital as well as land (and labor as well - their opposition to high labor incomes was also an issue). Their conclusion was that it was the state's responsibility to acquire this rent (a position strikingly familiar to Henry George.  Their later admiration of Soviet Russia stemmed partly from Stalin's ""efficiency"" at acquiring this rent.  The playwright George Bernard Shaw and the political scientist Graham Wallas were the other members of the early Fabian ""inner circle"". As one contemporary noted, the Fabians ""combined an ounce of theory with a ton of practice"". The practice, for the Fabians, was to influence public opinion in the direction of socialism. This was to be accomplished, they argued, not through mass organization but rather by the selective education of the powerful ""few"" who would lead the reforms in government (hopefully themselves), thus they only belatedly extended their appeal beyond the narrow intelligentsia class from which they arose. It was the Webbs who founded the London School of Economics (L.S.E.) in 1895. Through the relentless outpouring of Fabian Essays and the charismatic appeal of the Webbs - coupled with the prowess of literary figures such as George Bernard Shaw and H.G. Wells - ensured that they would be indeed influential among British intellectuals and government officials. Alfred Marshall, for one, readily admitted his sympathies for the Fabian cause (although he abhorred their anti-theoretical stance). Philip Wicksteed - who tangled with Shaw over the labor theory of value and marginal utility theory - was considerably more critical. It was this narrowness of appeal that led some Fabians, such as G.D.H. Cole and novelist H.G. Wells to break with the Fabians. Cole went on to establish the ""Guild Socialists"" who relied more on state-chartered but nonetheless self-governing producer organizations of workers - ""guilds"" - than on the intellectual-government machine the Fabians preferred. In this sense, the ""Guild Socialists"" were closer to the French syndicalism of Sorel - albeit a bit more muted. Further splits in the Fabian camp emerged when the Webbs and Shaw decided to throw their weight behind the British Imperial enterprise - supporting the Boer War and other colonial misadventures - as they felt their reforms (when they came about) would thus have a wider application. An overarching British Empire, they believed, would be a more efficient conductor of reform than a multitude of smaller countries. The Webb's support of monopolies was also well-known -- particularly, in their famous 1897 claim that ""higgling in the market"" (i.e. competition) was inimical because competitive prices always bore down on the workers. Thus, monopolies are more desirable as they would have more room to treat their workers better. The Fabians finally disintegrated in the 1930s for a variety of reasons. Firstly, the Webbs' unqualified admiration of Soviet Russia seemed distasteful to too many in their group. Secondly, the ascendancy of the British Labour Party on the back of trade union activism had rendered the Fabians superfluous. This body of working class activists did not trust the paternalistic and nationalistic Fabians (esp. after the Education Act of 1902, essayed by Sidney Webb and against which almost all of the Labour Party was mobilized).  However, Arthur Henderson, Labour Party leader from 1914 to 1922 was himself a Fabian and it was Sidney Webb who authored the famous Clause Four of the Labour Party charter committing it to a Socialist basis. Thirdly, they lost control of the L.S.E. when Cannan and then, more vigorously, Robbins turned it on a decidedly Jevonian track.  Fourthly, their intellectual influence during the 1930s was overshadowed by that of Keynes.   Finally,  many of the reforms they had advocated had actually been undertaken during and after the Great Depression, thus rendering their work, in a sense, ""complete"". Of particular importance was the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state in Britain in the 1940s following the famous 1942 ""Beveridge Report"".

The German Historical School," The German Historical School burst into existence in the mid-19th Century, partly as a reaction to the growing laissez faire ideas spreading in Europe at the time.  It explicitly rejected economics as practiced by the British Classical School of Ricardo and Mill.  The roots of the German Historical School were in Hegelian philosophy and the romantic critiques of abstract theory launched by Adam M√ºller and Friedrich List.  Its flavor, as its name indicates, was ""historical"" and thus relied much on empirical and inductive reasoning.  Its kinships abroad include the English Historical School, the French Historical School and the American ""New Generation"" (proto-Institutionalists). The emergence of the German Historical School  resulted from the 19th C. breakdown of the pet project of the 17th C. natural law philosophers and the 18th C. Enlightenment philosophers - namely, to establish an entire ""natural"" system (of economics, of law, etc.) by reason alone, that is, that the principles of economics were discoverable by speculative reason, from reasoning as to the nature of man in the abstract.  The German philosopher Immanuel Kant had undermined the philosophical foundations of the Enlightenment project by pointing out that pure reason would not achieve this goal. Others were quick to add that 18th C. economics was all entangled with political philosophy, that the economists had got themselves tied up in knots, unable to distinguish what is from what the economist thought ought to be the case.  In the case of law, Kant himself had tried to show a way out, by pointing how by restricting one's self to a few fundamental principles or concepts - a fundamental idea of justice, a principle of right -  the rest could be systematically built, rather than attempting to uncover an entire ""system of nature"" in one go.  This gave wings to what may be called a ""metaphysical"" strand of German thought in the 19th C.  But another less compromising line of German thought, which may be called ""historical"", forwarded the notion that human social constructions - such as the legal system, the economic system and so on - were the result of the entire history of a people, not something that could emerge fully-fledged by speculation in the mind of a philosopher nor created by diligent legislation.   The post-Kantian metaphysical and historical strands in 19th Century German thought were not wholly separate. We find them often overlapping and fused, most famously in the work of the influential philosopher Georg W.F. Hegel, where history is interpreted as revealing some essential underlying idea or principle over time.  The German Historical School transplanted that same method and spirit to the field of economics. The influence of Hegel on German scholarship spread in the 1830s, from its epicenter in Berlin, to the rest of the German universities..  The early or Older Historical school emerged around the mid-19th Century, its youth forged in the cauldron of disappointment of the 1848 revolutions.  The older school was not quite a fused movement, but emanated from separate centers.  The older school is represented by the trio of Wilhelm Roscher at Leipzig, Karl Knies at Heidelberg and Bruno Hildebrand at Jena.  They achieved the peak of their influence in the 1860s.   The early methodological principles of the Historical school were laid down by Wilhelm Roscher.   Roscher disparaged the idea of universal theoretical systems -- arguing that economic behavior and thus economic ""laws"" were contingent upon their historical, social and institutional context. To derive any economic ""laws"",  the method must be inevitably cross-disciplinary: one must look at economic life with the eye of a historian and sociologist, as well as an economist. Hence the first task would be essentially that of combing through history for economic details in order to arrive at some idea of what this relationship between the social and economic organization of society might be. As a result, much of the work of the early Historical school of Roscher, Knies and Hildebrand, etc  is couched in terms of various ""stages"" of economic organization through history and in ""organic"" metaphors. The Younger Historical School emerged in the 1870s, a much more confident period, after the 1871 Franco-Prussian war and German unification. The Younger School encompassed Gustav Schmoller, Adolf Wagner,  Lujo Brentano, and several others, and represents the historical school at its brashest.  The Younger School relinquished the  positivist veil of their predecessors.  Economics, they claimed, was inherently a normative discipline and thus should be engaged in forging tools for use by policymakers and businessmen. In their view, history exists only to provide illustrations for the particular problem at hand. The Historicists put their words into practice and formed an association, the ""Verein f√ºr Socialpolitik"" in 1873, as a vehicle for economic policy activism. However, the Verein was quickly seen as an tool, or at least a cheerleader, of the German government's efforts to industrialize their economy.  They were instrumental in the forging of Bismarckian economic and social policy and packed the German civil service and academia with their students.  It earned Schmoller and his colleagues the label of ""socialists of the chair"" (Katheder Sozialisten).  In 1883, the Viennese Neoclassical theorist, Carl Menger, turned his methodological guns on the the Historicists -- partly in an effort to find elbow room for his fledgling marginalist theory. The Historicists retreated from their normative position back into the old arguments of Roscher - claiming that their method merely sought to find historical laws first, a positive effort, before theory could be applied.   The Methodenstreit between the German and Austrian Schools was highly acrimonious and resolved nothing.  Some have claimed that the Austrians emerged victorious, but it was an empty victory.  The Historicists retained their prominent position and control of German academic establishment.  The members of the ""Youngest"" Historical School were of a very different flavor - initially, they were much less conservative than the Schmoller generation and sought to return to the early positivism of Roscher. Indeed, in some ways, Werner Sombart, Arthur Spiethoff, and Max Weber had closer ties to Marxian economics than they did to the Schmoller group.  To this ""Youngest"" school, one can append the Kiel School led by Adolph Lowe in the 1920s, which was an important center for both independent business cycle research as well as cross-disciplinary social science. In that sense, it adopted the positivist position of Roscher and Older Historical school. However, its espousal of normative ""instrumentalism"" made it also a policy-oriented group - thus may almost be regarded as a more socialist version of Schmoller's Verein. The Kiel School was heavily involved in Social Democratic politics and social and economic policy under the Weimar Republic. It was dismantled after Hitler's rise to power and most of its members were exiled. The ideas of the German Historical School  spread to other countries in the late 19th Century, at a time when many young foreigners came to German universities for graduate study.  It was highly influential in Italy and the United States - the ""Lombardo-Venetian"" school in Italy and the American ""New Generation"" in the 1870s-90s can be regarded as direct offshoots of the German Historical School.  The English and French Historicists, by contrast, drew from a wider range of influences, but can be drawn together by a common approach.  Although the impact of the German Historical School on economics, and indeed in social science in general, was widespread and influential in its day, little of it was inherited by modern economics.  There remain some trace of their ideas scattered in various quarters - such as in the ""goldsmith"" and Chartalist theories of money, the ""stages"" of economic development and economic location theory. Furthermore, there has always remained elements of the German Historical School in European and American heterodox economics.

The French Historical School," The establishment of chairs of economics in law faculties throughout France in the 1870s broke the monopoly held by the French Liberal School on the French establishment.  Many of the new appointees were of a quite different stripe.  Inspired by German Historicism (and modestly inspired by the rising discipline of sociology) this new breed of French academic economists pursued the historical and empirical method in their economics.  They were also quite politically involved, some of them leaning heavily towards socialist, syndicalist, cooperative and corporatist movements.  Their main organ was the Revue √©conomique internationale. However, one could argue that they were never really a self-conscious ""school"" as such and even its ""historicist"" credentials could be disputed.  Under the leadership of the eminent √âmile Levasseur, the French Historical School did much to smother the growth of Neoclassical economics in France.  But a few, notably Charles Gide, Adolphe Landry and, more unabashedly, Etienne Antonelli, were extremely receptive and may even be regarded as proponents.  Its business cycle strand, notably the work of Albert Aftalion, was highly theoretical and influential on subsequent cycle theory.

The American Historical School," The ""New Generation"" is used to refer to generation of ""progressive"" American economists in the final decades of the 19th Century. The New Generation economists had many things in common.  Almost all ""New Generation"" economists were too young to have served in the Civil War, and grew up in its aftermath. The ""New Generation"" came into adulthood in the 1870s and 1880s, just as the industrial revolution was taking off in the United States. Many originated from New England, especially Massachusetts, and could trace their lineage to old English Puritan stock. Almost all were Protestants, often raised in religious households, and educated in the elite colleges of the Northeast.  Indeed, many were sons of Protestant ministers, and groomed for careers in the ministry, but set aside the collar of religious mission for the secular gospel of social reform.  The ""New Generation"" got their first taste of economics as undergraduates, from the apologetic lessons of the antebellum clerical school.  There, they heard the routine recitation of praises of the Divine hand of the market system, unbridled individualism and laissez faire.  But they were unconvinced.  The new post-bellum industrial age, with its social disruptions, disorders and sharpening inequalities seemed nothing like the economic harmonies extolled by their teachers. The common factor, de rigeur among the ""New Generation"" economists, was to spend a period of graduate education abroad in Europe, notably in German universities.  Young Americans going for graduate study in Germany started as a trickle in the early 1870s, accelerated in the late 1870s and turned into a flood by the 1880s.   The academic tour in Germany was formative.  German universities, with their modern subjects, research-orientation and earned degrees, were an entirely different educational environment.  The young Americans came under the influence the German Historical School, sitting at the feet of the likes of Adolph Wagner in Berlin, Johannes Conrad in Halle, Karl Knies in Heidelberg, Gustav Cohn in G√∂ttingen, etc. They embraced the historicist, empirical approach of their German professors, and eschewed the abstract theoretical constructions of the British classical school of economics they had been fed back home.  The Germans derided the ""Manchesterthum"" laissez faire policy conclusions of the British school and emphasized the vital role of the State in the economy, as a harmonizer and arbitrator of interests, and corrector of the social ills of industrial capitalism.  It seemed like music to the ears of young Americans, hungry for a progressive social gospel.    The ""New Generation"" imbibed these lessons and carried them back to the United States, and as such can be called the school of ""American Historicism"". The German experience also showed the young Americans how economists could be more than amateur dabblers, and become professionals - with prestigious careers as university professors,  government advisors and public intellectuals, at or near the top of the social  heap.  As a result, the ""New Generation"" were instrumental in the professionalization of economics in the United States.  Their greatest success was in the transformation of the American university system.   Economics and other social sciences, indeed modern subjects as a whole, were largely non-existent in American colleges in the early 1870s.  But the push for reform was on. By the late 1870s, there were three economics professors in American universities and a slew of new elective courses on economic subjects that needed lecturers.  These opportunities expanded greatly through the 1880s. Economics initially shared space with history and political science in academia.  But dedicated economics departments were in place in most American universities by the end of the 1890s..  The New Generation of American historicists, with their minted German degrees, filled most of these positions.  The New Generation staffed the new modern universities established by gilded age fortunes in the United States, such as Johns Hopkins (f.1876), Stanford (f.1885), Chicago (f.1892) and others.  They also supplied faculty for older established universities (e.g. . Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin), helping shift them decisively away from their old Anglo-Saxon roots, in a more research-oriented direction of the German model. The American Economic Association (AEA), founded in 1885, was established by the New Generation economists on the model of the German Verein f√ºr Socialpolitik. With their Historicist background, the New Generation did not shy away from direct confrontation with Classical and then Neoclassical economics, although their real targets were the plethora of apologists that dominated the American academic scene. Deploring the the universalist pretensions of much of economic theory, they stressed the importance of historical, social and institutional factors which make so-called economic ""laws"", contingent on these factors. Much of everything in the economic world, they argued, was not immutable but rather conditioned by the influence of an always changing history - whether acting on the individual directly, or indirectly through the institutions and society which surround him. This confrontation resulted in some famous methodological battles, e.g. publicly in the pages of Science magazine in 1885-86, and internally between Richard T. Ely and Simon Newcomb at Hopkins. The ""New Generation"" also impelled the creation of new journals for the dissemination of research.  Early American economists had published in a variety of literary reviews, most notably the North American Review (f. 1824), the New Englander & Yale Review (f.1843) and the International Review (1874-83), and also occasionally in magazines like Science,  Bankers' Magazine, Harper's, Lippincott's and the Atlantic Monthly.  In 1882, Johns Hopkins began putting out monographs and articles in the series The Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science.  In 1886, three American economics journals came out - the Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE) from Harvard, the Political Science Quarterly (PSQ) of Columbia and the Publications of the American Economic Association (proto-AER).  They were joined by the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science (Pennsylvania) in 1890, and the Journal of Political Economy (JPE) of the University of Chicago, in 1892. The New Generation eventually evolved into the American Institutionalist School.

The American Institutionalist School.," The American Institutionalist School, commonly associated with Thorstein Veblen, John Commons and Wesley Mitchell, was for a brief period effectively the orthodoxy in the United States, sandwiched between the fall of the American apologists in the early 1900s and the Paretian revolution of the 1930s. The Institutionalist school developed from its origins in the ""New Generation"" of American economists in the late 1880s, who had trained abroad in Europe, and were heavily influenced by the German Historical School and the English Historicists.  In the beginning, they did not shy away from direct confrontation with Classical and then Neoclassical economics, although their real targets were the plethora of apologists that dominated the American academic scene.  The distributional apologetics of the Neoclassicals seemed laughable in light of the growing inequality of the Gilded Age. Fortunes were being amassed well beyond the the consumption needs of tycoons, business trusts were hardly behaving according to textbook theory, etc.  The younger generation of American historicists, and subsequently the Institutionalists, took to examining human motivation directly as it was, looking to human instincts and habits and their formation by cultural, social and legal institutions, to explain the drives of capitalism.  Deploring the the universalist pretensions of much of economic theory, the Institutionalists stressed the importance of historical, social and institutional factors which make so-called economic ""laws"", contingent on these factors. Much of everything in the economic world, they argued, was not immutable but rather conditioned by the influence of an always changing history - whether acting on the individual directly, or indirectly through the institutions and society which surround him. The methodological battle between Richard T. Ely and Simon Newcomb had robbed the early Institutionalists of their early strongholds, the Johns Hopkins University and the American Economic Association (AEA). The growing sway of the Marginalist Revolution over American academia - particularly at the hands of Fisher at Yale, Taussig at Harvard and Knight at Chicago, gnawed further away at the Institutionalists' position. Nonetheless, by the1920s, several schools were in Institutionalist hands - Columbia under Wesley Mitchell and Wisconsin under John Commons and other smaller departments like the New School and the University of Texas. During this time, the Institutionalists withdrew from confrontation with the Neoclassical mainstream by concentrating on detailed empirical studies of businesses firms, labor, law and regulations, etc. One of their major legacies was the empirical measurement of business cycles. Wesley C. Mitchell founded the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) for precisely that purpose and, under his leadership, many economists concentrated on these laborious tasks - leaving us a quantitative legacy which lasts to this day. However, even this apparently innocuous task led to another confrontation: an empirical Methodenstreit - only now with Koopmans and the Cowles Commission econometricians. A mighty blow was delivered by the Keynesian Revolution which rendered their now- reduced role as heterodox critics of the Neoclassical orthodoxy partly superfluous. Nonetheless, for many years, the dissenting voices of John Kenneth Galbraith and Robert L. Heilbroner maintained the old school alive. An interesting development in recent decades has been the gradual encroachment of the ""imperialistic"" New Institutional schools on territory that has typically been reserved for the Institutionalists. . To a considerable degree, these schools of economists turned the old Institutionalist position on its head - using Neoclassical economics to explain history, social relations and the formation of institutions rather than the other way around, as the old Institutionalists proposed, of using history and institutional concerns to explain economic behavior, structures and patterns.

Evolutionary Economics.," ""Evolution"" is a very popular notion these days. It is applied in all sorts of social contexts, so why not economics?  It certainly is alluring.  The very concept ""evolution"" brings to mind precisely the sorts of things that every ambitious and wide-eyed scholar would want in his theory -- struggle, change, history, dynamism, creation, destruction, variety, etc.  As a result, the narrow, formal definition it enjoys in biology  has been a bit lost in the  transfer to economics (and other social sciences).   Indeed, the term ""evolutionary"" has been bandied about so freely that perhaps the only real definition of it is the following: a theory is said to be ""evolutionary"" if it is my theory, it is said to be ""mechanical"" if it is your theory.(!) Early Evolutionary Economics The most popular conception of evolution is Charles Darwin's famous 1859 theory of ""natural selection"" applied to species of living organisms.  The basic idea is that organisms whose innate features are better suited to their environment will generally live longer and reproduce more often than less well-suited creatures.  Consequently, over time, by sexual reproduction and competition for resources, the number of the former will increase while the number of the latter will decrease to the point of extinction.  Of course, the process never ends because genetic mutations mean that new organisms with completely new and perhaps ""better-suited"" sets of attributes recurrently appear and challenge the older species. A competing theory of evolution is Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck's 1809 theory of ""adaptive selection"".   Lamarck's argument similarly contends that species with features better-suited to their environment features outdo those worse-suited.  However, unlike Darwin, Lamarck argued that species could ""adapt"" to their environment during their lifetimes, and that these ""adaptations"" will be carried over through reproduction.   Changes in behavior or features, not random ""mutations"", are what create variety in the Lamarckian scheme.   Modern biology embraces only the Darwinian process, but in the context of social sciences, like economics, the Lamarckian process may actually be better suited than the Darwinian.   In the latter part of the 19th Century, economists and other social scientists began appealing to analogies between organisms in an environment to people in society.  The most prominent of these ""Social Darwinists"" (more accurately, ""Social Lamarckians"") was Herbert Spencer.  Spencer inspired economists like William Graham Sumner and Simon Nelson Patten to use the ""evolutionary"" analogy to apologistic ends -- arguing that the capitalist economy was a ""delicate organism"" formed by ""free contract"" and that attempts by government or trade unions to interfere with its ""natural evolution"" would be disastrous. Other economists were more excited by the theoretical possibilities of replacing the mechanical ""equilibrium"" analogy, borrowed form physics, that underpinned virtually all of contemporary economics with an evolutionary analogy, borrowed from biology.  Alfred Marshall (1890) famously called biology ""the Mecca of the economist"" (but himself did little about it).  In a famous paper, Thorstein Veblen (1898) exhorted his fellow economists to embrace an evolutionary approach.  Although Veblen left out most of the details of what such a theory was, he outlined what it should look like. Veblen chastised equilibrium theory for assuming that individual agents are purposeful ""prime movers"" and that the economic process ""ends"" in a glittering equilibrium.   Individuals, he argued, are governed by all sorts of instincts, habits, tropisms and what not, some purposeful, some not, some autonomous, some endogenous.   Agents create social institutions and their own volitions and desires are in turn influenced by them.   The result is not an ""equilibrium state"", but a process of continual and eternal co-evolution between individual agents and socio-economic institutions.   ""The evolution of social structure has been a process of natural selection of institutions. The progress which has been and is being made in human institutions and in human character may be set down, broadly, to a natural selection of the fittest habits of thought and to a process of enforced adaptation of individuals to an environment which has progressively changed with the growth of the community and with the changing institutions under which men have lived.  Institutions are not only themselves the result of a selective and adaptive process which shapes the prevailing or dominant types of spiritual attitude and aptitudes; they are at the same time special methods of life and of human relations, and are therefore in their turn efficient factors of selection.  So that the changing institutions in their turn make for a further selection of individuals endowed with the fittest temperament, and a further adaptation of individual temperament and habits to the changing environment through the formation of new institutions."" (Veblen, 1899: p.131) Many members of the American Institutionalist School embraced Veblen's vision, but specifying the details of an evolutionary process proved to be devilishly difficult.  As a result, much of the resulting research remained lop-sided -- emphasizing the part about institutions affecting behavior, but a lot less clear about how these institutions were actually created. Frank H. Knight (1935), while accepting Veblen's ideas about men and society, nonetheless felt that modeling the evolutionary process explicitly to be an impractical and fruitless task, best left outside the scope of economic analysis. ""History is to be sensed, not plotted."", he famously concluded.   One economist who attempted to ""plot history"" was Karl Marx (1866-92).  However, while Marx had a theory of history, he did not have one rooted in the biological analogy.  For Marx, history was a progress of developmental stages punctuated by sudden dramatic shifts.  These were not exogenous, of course, but  ""generated"" by the internal contradictions of the previous stage. The exact details of how the change occurred are more slippery.  Joseph Schumpeter (1912, 1942) followed Marx in his ""evolutionary"" theory.  Schumpeter's system never quite settles down, but is punctuated by waves of technical innovation.  As the Marx-Schumpeter theory of evolution is unconnected with the Darwinian or Lamarckian, we may place it as a ""third"" and distinctly economic type of evolutionary theory.  A fourth, distinctive type of evolutionary theory was promoted by Friedrich Hayek (1967, 1988).  Hayek's approach is distinctive because it uses societies and groups as units of selection.   Modern Evolutionary Theory The topic was not really broached again until the 1950s.   A series of studies finding that the managers of firms did not consciously adopt ""profit-maximization"" as their guide when running their firms led to a small debate in which some economists asked that the profit-maximization hypothesis be discarded. Some  Neoclassical economists appealed to the evolutionary analogy to defend the old view, arguing that firms need not be a consciously profit-maximizing.  Because profits translate into growth, there is a process of ""natural selection"" in the economy where firms which profit-maximize or have the profit-maximizing formula will flourish and survive, while those which do not will die out.   Milton Friedman (1953) took the more Lamarckian route that firms will be forced to adapt the profit-maximizing routines by this evolutionary pressure; Albert Alchian (1950) took the Darwinian route, arguing simply that we will see the composition of industry change towards the profit-maximizing solution as those with the right (i.e. profit-maximizing) routines grow in size, while those with different routines disappear into bankruptcy Alchian can be credited as introducing (or rather, re-introducing) the ""behaviorism"" into modern economics.  Behaviorism is the view that behavior alone, and not the motives for behavior, are susceptible to analysis, had been making substantial inroads in American psychology and was beginning to affect economics.  Economic concepts, such as ""utility-maximization"" and ""profit-maximization"", are not only questionable, but unnecessary.  An ""evolutionary"" theory in economics must satisfy at least the following three conceptions: As the term ""evolutionary"" in economics is elusively defined, there is not what one can call an ""evolutionary school"". There are, however, several quite unique economists whose work is difficult to classify into the better-known and clearly-defined ""schools"". The following, then, is not a coherent school but just a collection of original and distinct thinkers who, in large or in part, had ""evolutionary"" elements in their theories. Naturally, there are important predecessors we have omitted from this list (such as Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, Bernard de Mandeville, Carl Menger and Alfred Marshall) who had evolutionary ""elements"" in their theories but whose contributions were more fundamental in other directions.

The Soviet Planning Economists,"   The October Revolution of 1917 brought the Bolshevik Party under Vladimir Illyich Lenin to power in Russia.  As Karl Marx had given very few details of what a ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" should look like, the Russian communist leaders had to improvise.  In his original plans, Lenin had envisaged a post-Revolutionary Russia which would be ""in between"" capitalism and socialism.  He took as his model the German Bismarckian economy, adapted to Russia in the 1890s by Sergei Witte, where the ""commanding heights"" of the economy (banking, coal, iron, petroleum, heavy industry, railroads, etc.) were in the hands of a few monopolists, while the rest of the economy (notably agriculture) remained in the hands of small private entrepreneurs.  The only difference Lenin hoped to introduce was that the Russian State would take the role of the private monopolists in controlling the commanding heights. However, events would soon overwhelm Lenin's plans.  In the aftermath of the revolution -- and against Lenin's recommendation -- enthusiastic Russian workers (who interpreted the revolution in anarcho-syndicalist terms) had spontaneously taken control of many of the factories and businesses that, in Lenin's original economic plan, should have stayed in private hands.   Lenin reluctantly acquiesced to the workers' committees -- so long as war continued and the need to keep the factories going was paramount. The Bolsheviks' immediate priority was to make good on their promise of ""Peace, Land and Bread"".  The first was done by the hastily-drafted Peace of Brest-Litovsk with Germany, pulling Russia out of the First World War -- although war would return swiftly in the form of a brutal four-year civil war between the ""Reds"" and the ""Whites"".  As a result, from 1917 to 1921, the new Soviet authorities operated on the principle of a ""war economy"" -- State control of industry, channeling of capital to military purposes, forced requisitions and expropriation of surpluses, tight price controls, rationing, etc.  A State Planning Committee (Gosplan) was set up to coordinate the war industries.  Strumilin was the principal engineer of the ""War Communism"".  However, no national, long-term economic plan was drawn up in this period.    Once the civil war began fading away in 1920, the debate over the shape of the Soviet economy re-emerged.  What was at stake now was not so much ideology, but a more pragmatic problem: the rapid industrialization of Russia.  All parties agreed this was the urgent priority, the puzzle was how to bring it about.  This had already been a central issue of Tsarist times.  Russia was an overwhelmingly agricultural country with a massive amount of rural overpopulation. Tsarist-era industrialization efforts under Sergei Witte in the 1890s had yielded some fruit, but then the First World War intervened.  Besides the destruction of industry and infrastructure from the disruptions and fighting of the war and civil war, the anarchy of land redistribution in 1917-18 had led to a massive out-migration from the cities back to the rural areas.  The Russian economy seemed to be back at square one: Two broad groups in the Soviet leadership can be defined.  One (led by Trotsky) demanded the continuation of ""War Communism"" and thus a leap into a full, peacetime socialist centrally-planned economy.   The other group (led by Bukharin) polished Lenin's old Witte-like program -- with the Soviet government nationalizing the commanding heights only and relying on private entrepreneurs and markets to do the rest.   Lenin, of course, sided with Bukharin.  In 1921, ""War Communism"" was terminated and the ""New Economic Policy"" (NEP) inaugurated.  Peasants were allowed to sell their surpluses on the market and private businessmen were allowed to set up small industrial, commercial and financing concerns.  Nikolai Bukharin's long-term plan of Russian industrialization envisaged stimulating an internal market so that consumer and industrial goods production could proceed apace together, in a balanced terpsichory.  The basic idea was that with growth of prosperity in the countryside, and the realization of agrarian surpluses, would simultaneously lower living costs in the cities and provide the internal market for growth of consumer goods, thereby allowing industry to expand and inducing migration to the cities, thereby draining the countryside of excess population. Bukharin conceded that meant industrialization ""at a snail's pace"".  As the NEP advanced, agrarian incomes rose as great surpluses were indeed produced, but the greater part of that agricultural output remained in the countryside, with only a very small portion of the surplus making it to market to exchange for manufactured goods.   Bukharin was convinced that rural productivity would rise to the point where they would cross some threshold to finally form an internal consumer market and spark industry. The NEP continued after Lenin's death 1924.  Joseph Stalin, at that point merely the spokesman of the Soviet administrative and managerial elite, lent his support to Bukharin's program, which by 1925 seemed to be a success.  But things began to falter after that.  The criticisms of Trotsky and his economics guru Preobrazhensky, grew shriller.  Surpluses were not forthcoming,  Russian industry was not budging.  Preobrazhensky proposed to short-circuit the NEP's slow delicate terpsichory with nothing short of state takeover of the agricultural sector and forced labor, directly or indirectly, to drain the excess population from the countryside and accelerate the process.  Bukharin urged patience, but patience was increasingly in short supply in the Soviet communist leadership as the 1920s advanced.  Bellicose noises emanating from Japan fanned fears of Japanese adventurism, and raised alarmist concerns about the state of the Soviet armaments industry that even NEP well-wishers could not ignore. State requisitions increased and state procurement prices and market prices began diverge - which did not improve the situation, as peasants now had even less incentive to deliver.  Tales spread of rich rural farmers - kulaks - deliberately withholding surpluses, holding ""feasts"" in the villages, rather than delivering them unto urban markets. The notion that something more forceful must be done was gaining ground. Everything changed in 1928, after Stalin drove Trotsky into exile.  Hitherto supportive, Stalin turned against the NEP and took on the forceful recommendations of Preobrazhensky et al.  The NEP was declared defunct, and the First Five Year Plan launched in 1929, introducing large-scale collectivization of agriculture.  The First Five Year Plan however, depended on optimistic harvest forecasts, and did not account for the sudden disruption of agrarian life. The process of collectivization turned into a brutal ordeal, a virtual civil war broke out in the countryside.  Far from providing the urgent State procurement needs for industrialization, production plummeted and the shortfalls actually increased, to the point of creeping hunger, reaching its height in the horrific famine of the Winter of 1932-33.  To combat resistance to collectivization, the Soviet state erected a terror apparatus - the secret police,  OGPU, hitherto a specialized branch dealing with cases of counter-espionage, became a massive, powerful new institution, with increasing responsibility and powers, in the end managing major agrarian and industrial concerns powered by forced labor. As the immediate chaos and famine resulting from the massive displacement of people and resources began finally to subside, a Second Five Year Plan was launched in 1933.  It did not change the goals too much - it continued to assign priority to heavy industry, but there were no new disruptions - the battle for the countryside had already been ""won"", there was nothing to break anymore.  Except politically.  The heavy-handed First Five Year Plan had prompted criticism inside the party of Stalin's leadership, and mumblings were afoot to have him replaced.  This reached its height at the party congress of 1934, where the rank-and-file seemed to prefer anybody else to Stalin, with Leningrad party leader S.N. Kirov emerging as the favorite.  The assassination of Kirov nine months later - with or without Stalin's complicity - was the excuse for opening a new phase of terror, this time aimed at purging the party of ""subversives"" and ""plotters"".  The purges were also used to publicly find scapegoats for the excesses and disasters of the First Plan, deflecting blame from the plan or Stalin himself.  Nonetheless, the period of  Stalin's purges between 1936 and 1939 had no apparent economic motivation - they were overtly political, merely to secure Stalin's position.  As such, while some apologists have excused the mass death of 1929-1933 as inadvertent and same might say inevitable consequence of economic objectives, there was nothing economic, inadvertent or necessary about the mass deaths of 1936-39, which cost additional millions of lives.   The industrialization of Soviet Russia was already in motion, industrial output doubled from 1932 to 1937, and tripled in some heavy sectors like steel. The Soviet economic example had an impact outside the Soviet Union.  The human cost of Soviet industrialization was only vaguely perceived outside of Russia.  The Soviet Union had seemed to be unaffected by the Great Depression of the 1930s, and many saw central planning as a solution to problems of mass unemployment.  The apparent ""success"" of the Soviet Union, at least its immunity to the problems overcoming Western capitalist economies, would form the basis of the Socialist Calculation debate. The new industrial basis of the Soviet Union allowed it to survive, confront and eventually prevail over the Nazi German invasion of World War II.  By the 1950s, Soviet standards of living had improved enormously, comparable to middle-income Western countries.   The Soviet Union seemed to have been able to solve unemployment, give its workers decent wages, but also access to amenities such as universal health care, and the like.  There remained, however, the problem of consumer goods - the Soviet emphasis on heavy industry had left consumer goods sector relatively underdeveloped, so while people had wages, there were not many goods to buy with them.  The wage-goods gap would persist in centrally-planned Soviet Union, remaining a gnawing constant of Soviet life down to the 1980s. Perhaps the most significant lesson outsiders took away was that it was a possible for a large, poor, overpopulated, agrarian country to industrialize rapidly, and even become a world power, in a few short years of careful central planning.  Outsiders began to think of Soviet industrialization as a successful model of economic development, particularly for large poor countries, such as China and India, emerging in the post-war decolonization period.   Indeed, it can be argued that the Soviet example was the impetus for the rise of development economics as a whole.  Hitherto neglected in western economics canons, the Soviet example challenged economists to come up with alternative models of development, models that worked and did not require full-blown communism. Inside the Soviet Union, planning theory became more refined.  In the 1920s, the house journal of  Gosplan, Planovoe khozyaistvo (The Planned Economy), edited by N.A. Kovalevsky, was brimming over in articles related to socialist planning.  Gosplan was focused on two strands of research: the practical formulation of the immediate (first) Five-Year Plan and a more academic debate on longer-term economic strategy (the so-called ""General Plan"").  Soviet planning economics developed rapidly after the 1930s, addressing technical problems related to socialist planning at a time when computing was done largely by pencil and paper.  Techniques such as linear programming were developed independently by Soviet planning economists in the 1950s and 1960s.  There was the tricky matter of Marxian economics - namely that as the Soviet Union was ideologically built on Marx's theory, then its planning models and techniques had to be consistent with Marxian economic concepts.  As a result, planning theory was not always a purely technical matter, but had to be developed, or at least be articulated, with that theoretical constraint.

The Neo-Marxians/Radical Political Economy," During the inter-war period, while Marxism rose as major political force, paradoxically,  Marxian economics fell into neglect, at least outside of committed Marxist circles. After an iffy start, Neoclassical economics was gaining ground, making Classical-derived economic theories, like Karl Marx's, seem apparently quaint and obsolete.  Institutionalism had also robbed it of some of its thunder.  The practical political and economic problems of the inter-war period, the rise of Fascism, the ""Red Scare"" in America (and elsewhere), the widening of Marxian theory to sociology and philosophy, the Soviet-inspired focus on planning, had obscured the economic theory in Marx's work. One can almost say that, by the 1940s, most people (particularly in the United States and Great Britain) had already forgotten that Marx himself had been an economist at all!    In the 1940s, several English-language works by prominent economists began to emerge which took Karl Marx seriously as an economist -- notably, by Maurice H. Dobb (1937, 1946), Joan Robinson (1942) and Paul Sweezy (1942).  This was followed up by two other influential works by Paul Baran (1957) and Ernst Mandel (1962), that finally began putting Marxian economics on the economics map.  The works of Sweezy and Robinson are particularly notable for having brought attention to Marx's theory of value -- thus leading to the re-emergence of the old ""transformation problem"" that had bedeviled the old Marxians. Joan Robinson (1942) was unimpressed and argued that that Marxian economics should do without the labour theory of value -- a proposition that Oskar Lange (1935) had earlier recommended. Sweezy disagreed -- and several prominent economists, such as Ronald Meek (1956), Francis Seton (1957),  Nubuo Okishio  (1963), Andras Br√≥dy (1970), Paul A.  Samuelson (1971), Michio Morishima (1973), William J. Baumol (1974), Domenico Nuti (1977) Anwar Shaikh, Gerard Dumenil (1980), Duncan Foley (1986) and many others have attempted to grapple with the formal and logical foundations of Marx's theory of value.  However, the appearance of Piero  Sraffa's (1960) work on the Classical Ricardian System has led some (e.g. Ian Steedman, 1977) to suggest that the Marxian labor theory of value can be subsumed in the more general ""Neo-Ricardian"" theory.  Sweezy's 1942 book also set out the Bauer model of the breakdown of capitalism, which was subsequently corrected in the formal treatments of Evsey Domar (1948), Josef Steindl (1952) and  Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (1960).  Fel'dman's work on two-sector growth models was resurrected by Alexander Erlich (1953) and Evsey Domar (1957) and were later taken up with gusto everywhere. The work of the Americans Paul Baran (1957) and, later, Baran and Sweezy (1966) was particularly tailored to the post-war boom in the Western capitalist economies, which seemed to invalidate the ""chronic depression"" which the older Marxists had anticipated.  Marx's law of diminishing rate of profit did not seem to be working.  What Baran and Sweezy proposed was that in situations of monopoly capitalism there is no such tendency as prices are based on ""mark-up"".  Consequently, the source of crises is in the tendency for a rise in surplus.  Under monopoly capitalism, there is a need for an external source of demand and profitable outlets for investment.  This makes monopoly capitalism more aggressively outwardly looking than competitive capitalism.  It is on this basis that Baran and Sweezy develop their distinct theory of imperialism and center-periphery dependency which accounts for the state of economic underdevelopment in the world today.  In France, Ernest Mandel (1962) sought to embed to source of crises not in the rise of surplus but in the law of diminishing profit rate over Kondratiev long waves.  Profit rates, he claims, determine the rate of accumulation, and the rate of accumulation generates the waves.  The line which Baran, Sweezy and Mandel initiated  is sometimes called ""Neo-Marxist"" school or simply ""Radical Political Economy"", which broke open a tidal wave of work in the 1960s and 1970s.  The main channels was the New Left Review, the Monthly Review Press, and later on, the Review of Radical Political Economy.  There have been numerous ""offshoot"" Neo-Marxist schools which have taken on many of the themes and conclusions of the Marxian school, although they should not be considered rigorous applications of classical Marxian theory.  We note only the related ""Dependency School"" of development associated with Raul Pr√©bisch and Andre Gunder Frank, the ""World Systems"" school associated with Immanuel Wallerstein and the work on radical political economy of David M. Gordon, Samuel Bowles, Herbert Gintis and others.  A separate (and unrelated) school is the ""Analytical Marxian"" school, normally associated with the work of John E. Roemer and John Elster, which attempts to reduce some of the Marxian propositions to conventional, methodological individualism (i.e. with utility-maximizing rational agents, etc.). There have also been post-war developments in Marxian economics in other countries which, although highly influential, have not yet broached the English-languange market.  Japanese Marxism, for instance, has long been a source for traditional work -- indeed, the Marxian school was almost the ""orthodoxy"" in Japanese academia for a while.  Besides Michio Morishima and Shigeto Tsuru, the work of Kozo Uno, Nubuo Okishio and Makoto Itoh are particularly notable.  The work of the French Regulation School (Robert Boyer, Michel Aglietta, Alain Lipietz, etc.)  is a bit more eclectic in its foundation, closer to the Post Keynesians  in its approach.

The Cambridge Keynesians," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by Cambridge University or any other organization. See the official Cambridge University website] Strictly, the ""Cambridge Keynesians"" is a loose term used to refer to the unique group of British economists inspired by John Maynard Keynes's General Theory in a more ""fundamentalist"" way than the mainstream (mostly American) Neo-Keynesians of the post-war era.   Their origin stems from the inner circle, the five members of Keynes's ""Circus"" at Cambridge University in the early 1930s -- Joan Robinson, Richard Kahn, Piero Sraffa, Austin Robinson and James Meade.  The ""circus"" was a study group that assembled together to read Keynes's Treatise on Money soon after it appeared in 1930 and thereafter commented on the successive drafts of Keynes's General Theory before it was published in 1936. Forming a more distant ring, but in many ways no less important for the later development of Keynesian economics, were contemporary young economists in England at the time, such as Roy F. Harrod and Michal Kalecki at Oxford and Nicholas Kaldor, Abba Lerner and John Hicks at the L.S.E. -- who were the first to digest and expand upon Keynes's work, becoming thereby the flag-carriers outside of Cambridge proper.    Up until about 1960, the ""Cambridge"" research program followed largely the path initiated by Roy F. Harrod, effectively to explore the implications of Keynes's theory for long-run growth and endogenous cyclical fluctuations.  This may be considered the  the ""Oxbridge phase"" of the Cambridge Keynesians.    In the course of this research effort, several of the Cambridge Keynesians, particularly Joan Robinson and Nicholas Kaldor, began reorienting themselves more distinctly and inching towards an integration of Keynes's theory and Classical political economy. To a good extent, this move was inspired by the contemporary work of Michal Kalecki, who seemed to have been able to marry Marxian and Keynesian analysis in his (independent) work on macrofluctuations.   Perhaps the greatest impetus was Piero Sraffa, the eminence grise of Cambridge. Sraffa virtually single-handedly resurrectied the Ricardian theory of value  theory in his Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities (1960).  Although it followed upon Joan Robinson's original queries about capital aggregation (1954, 1956), Sraffa's ""capital critique"" set the radical ""counter-revolutionary"" tone of the Cambridge Capital Controversy that ensued with the mainstream Neo-Keynesians. The Robinson-Kaldor growth theory and the Cambridge Capital Controversy galvanized a new ""Sraffian"" generation of Cambridge Keynesians -- such as Luigi Pasinetti, Piero Garegnani, John Eatwell, Geoff Harcourt. They launched the ""Neo-Ricardian"" research program, an attempt at an explicit marriage of Keynesian theory of effective demand and the Ricardian theory of value.  In the course of their confrontation with Neo-Keynesian Synthesis,  the Cambridge Keynesians found sympathizers in the American Post Keynesian school. Thus, in summary, the ""Cambridge"" approach combines some part of three strands of work: that of the original ""macroeconomic"" vision of John Maynard Keynes, the ""distributional"" emphasis of Michal Kalecki and the ""value theory"" of Piero Sraffa - all three strands of which were perhaps personified in most clearly in the dynamic duo, Joan Robinson and Nicholas Kaldor, and carried on today by the Neo-Ricardian and Post Keynesian schools.

The Neo-Keynesian Synthesis.," The ""Neoclassical-Keynesian Synthesis"" refers to the Keynesian Revolution as interpreted and formalized by a largely American group of economists in the early post-war period.  The centrepiece of the Neoclassical-Keynesian Synthesis (or the ""Neo-Keynesian"" system) was the infamous IS-LM Model first introduced by John Hicks (1937) and then expanded upon by Franco Modigliani (1944).  The IS-LM model purported to represent the gist of John Maynard Keynes's General Theory (1936) in the form of a system of simultaneous equations.  One of the startling results of the IS-LM model was that it was unable to obtain the Keynesian result of an ""unemployment equilibrium"".   The model tended to yield the Neoclassical result of  ""full employment"".  As a result, in order to generate an ""unemployment equilibrium"" as a solution to this system of equations,  the Neo-Keynesians appealed to rigid money wages, interest-inelastic investment demand, income-inelastic money demand or some other imperfection to this system.   Thus it is referred to as a ""synthesis"" of Neoclassical and Keynesian theory in that the conclusions of the model in the ""long run"" or in a ""perfectly working"" IS-LM system were Neoclassical, but in the ""short-run"" or ""imperfectly working"" IS-LM system,  Keynesian conclusions held.  Later on, the Neo-Keynesians added the infamous Phillips Curve (Phillips, 1958; Lipsey, 1960) to the system  in order to enable them to account for inflation. The international sector was incorporated into an extended IS-LM system known as the Mundell-Fleming model (Mundell, 1962).  Much work also went into providing ""microfoundations"" for the basic Keynesian relationships: the consumption function was formalized as a utility-maximizing problem by Franco Modigliani   and Richard Brumberg (1953), the investment function was derived from profit-maximization by Dale W. Jorgensen (1963) and Robet Eisner and Robert H. Strotz (1963); the money demand function derived from utility-maximization by William J. Baumol (1952) and James Tobin (1956, 1958); the transmission mechanism (i.e. the impact of LM on IS) was expanded and given more detailed analysis by Lloyd Metzler (1951),  James Tobin (1961, 1969) and many others. The Neoclassical-Keynesian Synthesis was wildly successful and dominated macroeconomics in the post-war period.  For a long time, the Neo-Keynesian system was synonymous with the ""Keynesian Revolution"" and was highly influential in both theoretical, applied and policy work.  Abba Lerner (1944, 1951) was among the first to recognize the implications of the Keynesian system for government macroeconomic policy:  by appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, a government could ""steer"" the economy away from extremes and thus smooth out the business cycle.  This policy-effectiveness was given an enormous boost by the new econometric model-building techniques and optimal policy design criteria developed by Jan Tinbergen (1952), James E. Meade (1951), Lawrence Klein (1950), Robert Mundell (1962), Henri Theil (1964), William Poole (1970), Alan Blinder and Robert Solow (1973) which helped governments design and estimate the impact of various fiscal and monetary policies on employment and inflation. The Neo-Keynesian system came under sustained attack in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  In a famous tome, Axel Leijonhufvud (1968) argued that the Neo-Keynesians had completely thwarted the meaning of J.M. Keynes's General Theory.  Following Clower (1965), Leijonhufvud suggested that instead of pursuing ""unemployment equilibrium"" in an imperfect system, they should be analyzing ""prolonged disequilibrium"" in a system without ad hoc rigidities.  Their proposed ""Walrasian-Keynesian"" synthesis had long been suggested by earlier commentators such as Don Patinkin and Frank H. Hahn. The Cambridge Keynesians -- Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor, etc.,  to which one could add the Oxford economists Roy Harrod and John Hicks  -- had taken their version of the Keynesian Revolution in a direction very much different from the Neo-Keynesians.   They did not employ the IS-LM system but rather worked on extending the principal propositions of Keynes's General Theory to dynamic growth and business cycle models. (it is perhaps not surprising to note that the Neo-Keynesians, who believed that Keynesian results were only ""short-run"", did not really venture in this direction, but simply borrowed entirely from Neoclassical theory to build their own growth models).  The Cambridge Keynesians and their counterparts in the United States (the American Post Keynesians), considered the Neo-Keynesian construction as a horrendous betrayal of the Keynesian Revolution. However, the Neo-Keynesian system only came into serious trouble in the early 1970s, when a sudden, sustained bout of inflation and unemployment in the OECD countries did not seem to be compatible with the predictions of the Neo-Keynesian system -- and the traditional Keynesian policy-responses undertaken by various Western governments did not seem to alleviate the problem at all.  Milton Friedman (1968), the leader of the rival Monetarist School, proposed a ""natural rate of unemployment hypothesis"" that did seem consistent with the OECD experience.  This natural rate hypothesis was formalized by Edmund Phelps, Robert E. Lucas, Thomas Sargent and used as the basis of a ""New Classical"" macroeconomic theory, which has risen since the 1970s to replace Neo-Keynesianism as the new macroeconomic orthodoxy.

Disequilibrium Keynesianism,"   The school has gone by a variety of names ""Disequilibrium Keynesianism"", ""Non-Walrasian"", etc., but a fair designation would be a ""Walrasian-Keynesian"" synthesis.  It emerged in the late 1960s as a challenge to the orthodox Neo-Keynesian synthesis. In the late 1960s, young economists dissatisfied with the conventional partition between Neoclassical micro and Keynesian macro proposed to provide ""microfoundations"" for the latter.  More precisely, that the economy should by modeled as a general equilibrium model with macroeconomic constraints.   They asserted that the essence of the J.M. Keynes's original characterization of unemployment - that firms will not hire without demand, workers will not demand without wages - should be modeled as an aggregate coordination problem, a situation of protracted disequilibrium that price flexibility could not solve.    The call for embedding Keynes's results in a Walrasian general equilibrium setting with effective demand constraints can probably be traced back to Don Patinkin (1956).  But the proper birth of the Disequilibrium school is the challenges forwarded by Robert Clower (1965) and Axel Leijonhufvud (1967, 1968).  The Franco-Belgian ""Non-Walrasian"" school of macroeconomics in 1970s further formalized the propositions and extended the approach.

The Mandarins," The ""mandarins"" refers to economists in government service, whether as temporary advisors or career civil servants. From the very beginning of time, economists have served government and influenced policy-making.  Indeed, many of the earliest economists were precisely courtiers or bureaucrats writing on the affairs of their nation, espousing ideas about the doctrines and practices of government involvement in the economy, particularly active in the Mercantilist age, which they sometimes carried out themselves.   In the 19th Century and early 20th Century, the role of the economist in government diminished somewhat.  In the age of laissez-faire capitalism, government policy was passive and thus more simple. Government did not ask for high economic theorists for assistance -- they could do well enough with a mix of liberalism and crude apologism.  This did not mean that economists had no policy influence -- see the Bullionist Controversies and the debates on trade and you will find some of the greatest economists of the 19th Century involved.  But as economics became a more professional, academic discipline, economists became increasingly  happy enough to sit in the ivory tower, pursuing their theories to such a point of abstraction that direct translation into policy applications was neither obvious nor operational.  Of course,  there were a variety of wide-eyed socialist, syndicalist and populist movements urging for particular government policies, but they were not distinctly ""economists"" and not particularly successful anyhow. There were exceptions, of course.  In the German Historical School, the French Historical School and among the Fabian Socialists, there were influential economists who still saw a active role for government in the economy.  The state of affairs changed considerably between the 1920s and the 1950s.  World War I had destabilized the old 19th Century bourgeois liberal consensus and many looked to the State for direction. The post-1918 German and Austrian ""socialization"" experiments, the Bolshevik Revolution and the Five-Year Plans of Soviet Russia, the rise of Fascist corporatism in Western Europe, the Great Depression and the New Deal in the United States, the experience of  ""command"" economies during the World War II, the collapse of the Gold Standard and the search for a replacement, etc. had all helped put the economist back in the center of government policy-making.   However, even through all these changes, economic theory itself had little guidance to offer.  Most of what the policy economists recommended were practical measures which they came up with off-the-cuff.   The golden age for the ""Mandarin"" economist was doubtlessly the post-war period.  Perhaps the most critical event in the government-economist relationship was the publication of John Maynard Keynes's General Theory in 1936.  The Keynesian Revolution found a theoretical role for interventionist, discretionary government policy in the economy.   The new relationship was swiftly formalized  and governments enlisted legions of economists to help sort all this out.  Britain, France, Germany and much of the rest of Europe built up national accounts, set up welfare states, overhauled their fiscal codes, regulated or nationalized industries, coordinated trade unions and actively used their Treasuries and Central Banks for economy-wide stabilization policy.  In the United States, the New Deal merged into the Employment Act of 1946 and the setting up of the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA).  In Japan and, later on, in various East Asian nations, government took an even more active role, guiding capital and setting international trade policies that helped launch and guide their miraculous growth experiences.  Soviet planning was overhauled with the guidance of new techniques.  The emergence of newly independent  nations from the ashes of colonial empires, bent on development and not averse to planning, meant a whole new set of government clients for policy-oriented economists.  Multi-lateral government agencies, such as the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, hired another army of economists.   However, the economic disasters of the 1970s and early 1980s began to set the tide in reverse.  In the rising ""neo-liberal"" Reagan-Thatcher era, a new set of economists were needed -- particularly those that could justify the ""supply-side"" fiscal policies and Monetarist experiments of the conservative governments.  In the 1990s, with the wave of privatizations of state industries across the world and the collapse of socialist bloc, a whole generation of planning economists were made suddenly obsolete (albeit many reinvented themselves as ""transition"" specialists).  Central Banks, which have grown in importance in recent years, have remained perhaps the last bastion of government where economists and their opinions still matter. Many of the more important government economists during the post-war era were academic economists, temporarily on loan to governments.  However, there were many civil servants in their own right who achieved a degree of prominence and influence, not only in policy-making but also in more general economic thinking of the age.  The following list of ""mandarins"" includes some of the most famous policy-oriented economists -- both of  the academic and non-academic variety.

Business Cycle Theory," The existence of ""economic crises"" marked by industrial depressions is alluded to already in the works of Mercantilists, Physiocrats and even Adam Smith.  However, it is common to identify the 1825 British crisis as the first general economic crisis of importance to draw the attention of economists.  (Some also use this 1825 date to mark the beginning of modern industrial capitalism).  While the idea of crisis has been debated for some time, the idea that crises are periodic - that is, something that comes and goes and returns again with some regularity, that is, a cycle, rather than a singular incident - took longer to set in. Among the earliest writers to try to provide an economic theory of industrial depressions are the Earl of Lauderdale, Thomas Spence and Heinrich Storch.  They depicted economic crises as a situation of general overproduction brought about by the excessive build-up of production capacity, and the failure of consumption to rise up to meet it.  .The Classical economists - notably James Mill, Jean-Baptiste Say, David Ricardo and Nassau William Senior - rejected overproduction as a theoretical impossibility, and characterized economic crises as misdirected, rather than excess, production.  The topic became somewhat urgent in the post-Napoleonic wars slump, and culminated in the ""General Glut"" controversy of 1819-21.  Against the classical argument, Robert Malthus, Simonde de Sismondi and Thomas Chalmers revived the overproduction theory, but a little more elaborately, explaining underconsumption via dynamic mismatches in income distribution and expenditure among social classes.   The 1825 and 1836 crises brought money and finance into the picture for the first time.  The role of the banking system in provoking the slumps was discussed during banking controversy of the late 1830s and early 1840s, between Samuel Jones Loyd (Lord Overstone) and Thomas Tooke and their followers in Britain, and was carried over by Hans von Mangoldt in Germany, Courcelle-Seneuil in France and Amasa Walker in the United States.  These new theories explained economic crises in terms of a sudden collapse in investment spending, as a result of financial losses due to speculative bubbles and/or in facilitating excessively optimistic build up of productive capacity during periods of overlending.  German Historicists such as K.H. Rau, W.G.F. Roscher and Lujo Brentano, backed away from monetary theories, and came up with eclectic theories, focused on specific real ratios of production proportions and distribution of consumption.  This may be called antecedent to the ""German tradition"" of cycle theory, focusing on inter-sectoral maladjustments (in contrast to the ""English tradition"" of dynamic maladjustment). Socialist literature produced many theories of economic crises.  It is possible to distinguish between those which saw crisis as a necessary consequence arising from income distribution under capitalism (e.g. William Godwin, William Thompson, P.-J. Proudhon, Karl Rodbertus, Eugen D√ºhring),  and those which saw crisis as an inevitable outcome of the capitalist organization of industrial production (Sismondi, Louis Blanc, Henry George, Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Karl Kautsky, Brentano,  Albert Sch√§ffle, Adolph Wagner, Wilhelm Lexis). The idea of a periodic cycle can be found already in the 17th C. work of William Petty, who identified a seven-year cycle (""and the medium of seven years, or rather of so many years as makes up the Cycle, within which dearths and plenties make their revolution"", Petty's 1662 Treaties on Taxes and Contributions p.23-24), although it was not followed up.  The identification of periodicity (initially a decennial cycle) was proposed by William Langton (1857) and John Mills (1867), who tied it to personal feelings and credit, while William Stanley Jevons.(1862, 1867) famously tied it to the real phenomena of sunspots and harvests.  But it is really to the fundamental study of Cl√©ment Juglar (1862) that business cycles and their periodicity became established as a topic of research. The relationship between economic theory and business cycles has been a complicated one, and not always intimate. With equilibrium serving as an organizing concept of economic theory, particularly after the Marginalist Revolution of 1871, and focused on individual markets rather than the macro-economy, it offered little or no room for regular fluctuations.  For a long time the research programs proceeded along parallel tracts, with little contact with each other. Business cycle theory became the province of the French and German historical schools, and was taken up with special verve by the American Institutionalist School.  In the inter-war period, Wesley Clair Mitchell and the NBER became the pre-eminent experts on business cycle, focusing on establishing their empirical stylized facts of the cycle. The post-WWI slump and especially the 1920 recession, however, was a watershed.  It is really only then that pure economic theorists began to try explaining business cycles.  Some (e.g. H.L. Moore) tried to account for them via existing general equilibrium theory, and a few (e.g. Frisch) relied on random shocks to drive longer fluctuations. Others transformed equilibrium theory into a new aggregative ""macro-economic"" theory.  In many ways, the debates after 1920 resurrected the arguments of a century earlier. The (Marshallian) Cambridge School and the Stockholm School turned to explaining crises in terms dynamic maladjustments between expectations and outcomes, facilitated by means of bank credit - echoing the earlier banking-currency school debates.  The ""German tradition"" of inter-sectoral maladjustment was taken up by the Kiel School (in real terms) and the Austrian School (with the contrivance of money).  Underconsumption theories were resumed by Foster and Catchings, and, most famously, John Maynard Keynes. The Great Depression after 1929 changed things once again.  The prolonged, apparently never-ending slump discredited the assumed periodicity of the cycle.  The Keynesian Revolution fundamentally changed the research program, setting cyclical aspects aside, and focusing on the possibility of equilibrium settling permanently at underemployment.  Interest in the cyclical aspects resumed in the post-WWII period, now armed with the toolkit of Keynesian macroeconomics, to explain cyclical macro-fluctuations.

Empirics and Econometrics," Ever since Sir William Petty began recording (and inventing) economic data in 17th Century Britain, empirical work has always played an important role in economics for two reasons: namely, economists think that (1) economic insights can be gained by careful examination of the data (the ""inductive approach"") and (2) existing economic theories can be validated or falsified by comparing their claims against empirical data (the ""theoretical approach""). However, not all economists agree with these two reasons, and those that agree with one of them, often disagree with the other. The inductivist approach has a long history: from data, Jevons (1875, 1884) gleaned evidence of a sunspot-driven business cycle; Juglar (1862) saw in financial tables evidence for a credit-driven cycle. Similarly, H.L. Moore (1914, 1923) used the inductive approach to argue for a weather and astral-driven cycle. However, the theoretical approach was also used: as far back as Charles D'Avenant (1699) and later on Fleeming Jenkin (1870), economists had attempted to fit data to demand curves. This was the particular skill of the same Henry L. Moore who attempted to fit data to Walras's demand equations. Moore's students at Columbia - Henry Schultz and P.H. Douglas - carried this work on into the 1930s. Similar work was carried out in Britain by A.C.Pigou and in Germany by Jacob Marschak. Another development occurred at Columbia soon after: a return of the inductivist approach for analyzing business cycles under Wesley C. Mitchell. The inductivist approach had, naturally, been favored both by the German Historical School and the American Institutionalists, but only under W.C. Mitchell and his National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) was much systematic research done in this regard. The measurement of business cycles were the main topic and Mitchell's NBER included such notable contributors to empirical economics such as Arthur F. Burns, John Maurice Clark, Simon Kuznets, Frederick C. Mills, Rutledge Vining, Solomon Fabricant, Leonard P. Ayres and others of the American Institutionalist School. Business cycle measurement and analysis also in vogue elsewhere - such as under Persons and Bullock at Harvard, Kondratiev in Moscow, Wagemann in Berlin, √Ökerman in Lund, Morgenstern at Vienna,  and at the Kiel Institute. Naturally, the empirical recording and analysis of the business cycle spilt over into collecting and analyzing all sorts of empirical data - notably, the collection of national income accounts (output, investment, etc.), which became the primary activity of Simon Kuznets at the NBER and of Colin Clark in England. It was also in England that the massive collection of family expenditure data was undertaken by R.G.D. Allen and Arthur Bowley. Naturally, theoretical treatises on the business cycle, such as those by J.A.Schumpeter, D.H.Robertson, A.C. Pigou and G.Haberler, had been accompanied the presentation of empirical data, but they could not have said to be adopting the second ""theoretical approach"" entirely because they used no proper statistical inference methods to do so. The NBER approach was severely criticized by George Yule, Eugene Slutsky, Ragnar Frisch and, most famously, Tjalling C. Koopmans. This resulted in a rebirth of the theoretical approach and thus econometrics as we know it. The theoretical approach had been first applied usefully to business cycles by Jan Tinbergen in the late 1930s after the appearance of the General Theory of J.M. Keynes. By proposing some simple functional relationships between some relatively accessible variables (consumption, income, investment, etc.), Keynes had help prompt Tinbergen into action. Tinbergen used statistical methods, such as linear regressions, to estimate the parameters of the Keynesian relationships. Keynes himself was not too pleased with Tinbergen's techniques, considering them little more than ""black magic"" (Keynes, 1939). Keynes criticism of Tinbergen was only the first salvo in a series of critical reappraisals of Tinbergen's econometrics undertaken by Frisch and Haavelmo, Allen, Marschak and Lange. Galvanized into action, a great leap forward was achieved with the ""probabilistic approach"" to econometrics as famously proposed by Trygve Haavelmo (1944) and then taken up as the rallying cry of the Cowles Commission. Thus was formal textbook econometrics born. In a sense, Haavelmo's approach was what had been effectively been appealed to by older econometricians, but Haavelmo solidified it. The ensuing Methodenstreit in 1947-9 between the Cowles Commission (led by Koopmans) and the old NBER Institutionalists (represented by Rutlege Vining) that established the ""probabilistic"" version of the theoretical approach as the dominant one in empirical economics in the latter half of the 20th Century. The econometric boom was on. The work of the Cowles Commission led to development of estimation techniques for systems of simultaneous equations, such as the Klein-Goldberger model of Keynesian macroeconomics. However, to do so necessitated dealing with the ""identification"" problem which had so bedeviled the early work of Moore and Schultz. Effective solutions to the identification problem were worked on in the early Cowles years. The Klein-Goldberger Model of the macroeconomy complemented other large-scale structural models designed for empirical work and government planning - such as Leontief's input-output system. Modigliani and associates developed another large scale macro-model, the so-called MPS model (after the initials of the institutions which helped develop it, M.I.T., Penn and the Social Science Research Council (SSRC)). These models existed not so much to be tested as to help policy-makers. Yet not all was fine on the Cowles front. Herman Wold criticized the simultaneous techniques of these large models, arguing instead for recursive or at least block-recursive systems, which would require more careful analysis of time-series techniques. Richard Stone, an older style of data analyzer who conducted several pioneering empirical studies of demand, was similarly critical, as was Oskar Morgenstern. A more wide ranging criticism was expressed by Lord Robbins, where he denounced the empirical verification of theories on methodological grounds - following the footsteps of the Austrians. Finally, the most famous criticism was unveiled by Robert Lucas (1976), wherein he argued that the structural parameters of large scale models, particularly when used for policy policies, were assumed constant and thus did not comply with the propositions of what was then becoming the new mainstream macroeconomic theory. In a series of other papers, Lucas then outlined a new econometric methodology: time series macroeconometrics.

Economic Development," For many lay people, economic development - by which we mean the analysis of the economic progress of nations - is what economics as a whole is designed to address. Indeed, what but to find the ""nature and causes"" of economic development was Adam Smith's purpose? For modern economists, however, the status of economic development is somewhat more uncomfortable: it has always been the maverick field, lurking somewhere in the background but not really considered ""real economics"" but rather an amalgam of sociology, anthropology, history, politics and, all-too- often, ideology. Nonetheless, few of the greatest economists actually ignored it outright. As already noted, Adam Smith and indeed, perhaps the entire Classical School was concerned with what might be termed ""economic development"". Schumpeter's first famous book was entitled a Theory of Economic Development (1911). The German Historical School - and its English and American counterparts - could very well be deemed part of development economics. The entire theory of economic growth can be said to be geared towards it or even underlying it. Nonetheless, ""economic development"", as it is now understood, really only started in the 1930s when, prompted by Colin Clark's 1939 quantitative study, economists began realizing that most of humankind did not live in an advanced capitalist economic system. However, the great early concern was still Europe: namely, postwar European reconstruction and the industrialization of its eastern fringes - as exemplified by the pioneering 1943 article of Paul Rosenstein- Rodan and Kurt Mandelbaum's 1947 tome. It was only some time after the war that economists really began turning their concerns towards Asia, Africa and Latin America. To this end, decolonization was an important catalyst. Faced with a new plethora of nations whose standards of living and institutions were so different from the European, modern development theory, by which we mean the analysis not only of growth but also of the institutions which could induce, sustain and accelerate growth, began in earnest. Early development theorists - such as Bert Hoselitz, Simon Kuznets, W. Arthur Lewis, Hla Myint were among the first economists to begin analyzing economic development as a distinct subject. The post-war formation of the United Nations - and its attendant agencies, such as the World Bank, the I.M.F., the I.L.O. and the various regional commissions - proved to be another important impetus. The commissioning of numerous studies by these institutions led to the emergence of a non-academic strand of development theory. Development as Growth and Capital-Formation Early economic development theory was but merely an extension of conventional economic theory which equated ""development"" with growth and industrialization. As a result, Latin American, Asian and African countries were seen mostly as ""underdeveloped"" countries, i.e. ""primitive"" versions of European nations that could, with time, ""develop"" the institutions and standards of living of Europe and North America. As a result, ""stage theory"" mentality of economic development dominated discussions of economic development. As later made famous by Alexander Gerschenkron (1953, 1962) and, more crudely, Walt W. Rostow (1960), the stages theories argued that all countries passed through the same historical stages of economic development and that current underdeveloped countries were merely at an earlier stage in this linear historical progress while First World (European and North American) nations were at a later stage. ""Linear stages"" theories had been developed earlier by German Historicists, thus it ought not be surprising to find historians, such as Gerschenkron and Rostow, among its main adherents. More enlightened attempts to arrive at an empirical definition of the concept of ""underdevelopment"", as exemplified by the work of Hollis Chenery, Simon Kuznets and Irma Adelman, led to the general conclusion that while there were not explicit ""linear stages"", countries tended nonetheless to exhibit similar patterns of development, although some differences could and did persist. The task of the development economist, in this light, was to suggest ""short-cuts"" by which underdeveloped countries might ""catch up"" with the developed and leap over a few stages. By equating development with output growth, early development theorists, prompted by Ragnar Nurkse (1952), identified capital formation as the crucial component to accelerate development. The celebrated early work on the ""dual economy"" by Sir W. Arthur Lewis (1954, 1955) precisely stressed the role of savings in development. Early Keynesians, such as Kaldor and Robinson, attempted to call attention to the issue of income distribution as a determinant of savings and growth. Even modern Marxians such as Maurice Dobb (1951, 1960) focused on the issue of savings-formation. Of course, savings could themselves be manipulated by government intervention - as Lewis had intimated and the Keynesians insisted. Indeed, earlier, Rosenstein-Rodan (1943) had argued that increasing returns to scale made government-directed industrialization feasible. The notion of turning ""vicious circles"" of low savings and low growth into ""virtuous circles"" of high savings and high growth by government intervention was reiterated by Hans W. Singer in his doctrine of ""balanced growth"" and Gunnar Myrdal in his theory of ""cumulative causation"". Thus, government involvement - whether by planning, socio-economic engineering or effective demand management - was regarded as a critical tool of economic development. Other economists turned to international trade as the great catalyst to growth. Already Hla Myint, Gottfried Haberler and Jacob Viner had stressed this avenue - arguing along lines similar to the classical doctrine of Adam Smith that trade and specialization can increase the ""extent of the market"". However, earlier in the 1930s, D.H. Robertson had expressed his doubts on this account - and these were later reiterated by Ragnar Nurkse, H.W. Singer and R√°ul Prebisch. Social Aspects of Economic Development Although capital-formation never really left the field, the meaning of the term mutated somewhat over time. T.W. Schultz, drawing upon his famous Chicago School thesis, turned away from physical capital accumulation to emphasize the need for ""human capital"" formation. This led to an emphasis on education and training as pre-requisites of growth and the identification of the problem of the ""brain drain"" from the Third World to the First (and, as would later be stressed, from the private sector to government bureaucracies). W. Arthur Lewis and Hans W. Singer extended Schultz's thesis by arguing that social development as a whole - notably education, health, fertility, etc. - by improving human capital, were also necessary pre-requisites for growth. In this view, industrialization, if it came at the cost of social development, could never be self-sustaining. However, it was really only in 1969 that Dudley Seers finally broke the growth fetishism of development theory. Development, he argued, was a social phenomenon that involved more than increasing per capita output. Development meant, in Seers's opinion, eliminating poverty, unemployment and inequality as well. Singer, Myrdal and Adelman were among the first old hands to acknowledge the validity of Seers's complaint and many younger economists, such as Mahbub ul Haq, were galvanized by Seers's call to redefine economic development. Thus, structural issues such as dualism, population growth, inequality, urbanization, agricultural transformation, education, health, unemployment,etc. all began to be reviewed on their own merits, and not merely as appendages to an underlying growth thesis. Particularly worthy of note was the resurrection of the work of Chayanov on the unique structures of peasant economies. Also emergent, in this period, was a debate on the very desirability of growth. E.F. Schumacher, in a famously provocative popular book, Small is Beautiful (1973), argued against the desirability of industrialization and extolled the merits of handicrafts economies. As the world environmental crisis became clearer in the 1980s, this debate took a new twist as the very sustainability of economic development was questioned. It became clear that the very desirability of development needed to be reconsidered. Structuralism and its Discontents Before Seers's complaint, many economists had already felt extraordinarily uncomfortable with early development theory and the implicit assumptions behind ""stages"" reasoning. A new (or old - depending on one's vantage point) idea began to germinate - what may be loosely termed ""structuralism"". The ""structuralist"" thesis, succinctly, called attention to the distinct structural problems of Third World countries: underdeveloped countries, they argued, were not merely ""primitive versions"" of developed countries, rather they had distinctive features of their own. As mentioned, Chenery had argued a similar thesis, but nonetheless focused on the similarities of experience. The newer structuralists, in contrast, sought to bring attention to the differences. Albert O. Hirschmann (1958) was one of the early few who stressed the need for country-specific analysis of development - as was stressed later by Dudley Seers. One of these distinctive features was that, unlike European industrialization, Third World industrialization was supposed to occur while these countries existed alongside already- industrialized Western countries and were tied to them by trade. This, speculated a few, could give rise to distinct structural problems for development. Coincidental with H.W. Singer, the UNCLA economist, Ra√∫l Prebisch, formulated the famous ""dependency"" theory of economic development, wherein he argued that the world had developed into a ""center-periphery"" relationship among nations, where the Third World was regressing into becoming the producer of raw materials for First World manufacturers and were thus condemned to a peripheral and dependent role in the world economy. Thus, Prebisch concluded, some degree of protectionism in trade was necessary if these countries were to enter a self-sustaining development path. Import-substitution, enabled by protection and government policy, rather than trade and export-orientation, was the preferred strategy. Historical examples of government-directed industrialization, such as Meiji Japan and Soviet Russia, were held up as proof that there was not only one path to development, as had been implied by the cruder ""stages"" theories. The Prebisch-Singer thesis resounded with particularly with Marxian thinkers - who identified elements of Rosa Luxemburg's and V.I. Lenin's arguments on imperialism in it. Breaking with savings-obsessed orthodox Marxian thinkers such as Dobb, Neo-Marxians such as Paul Baran, Paul Sweezy, A.G. Frank and Samir Amin took the Prebisch-Singer thesis, merged it the Luxemburg thesis, and drew it into the modern era.  Many Third World governments adopted the language and policies of the structuralists and/or the Neo-Marxians in the 1960s and 1970s, and indeed, the movement seemed to have been eminently influential. ""Neo-Colonialism"", ""core-periphery"" and ""dependency"" were the catch-words of the day.  However, as time moved on, these policies seemed to fail to yield their promised fruit, and a Neoclassical (or, more accurately, Neo-Liberal) countermovement initiated by the lone voices of P.T. Bauer, I.M.D. Little, Deepak Lal, Bela Balassa, Anne Krueger and Harry G. Johnson began to gain more adherents. Their thesis was simple: government intervention did not only not improve development, it in fact thwarted it. The emergence of huge bureaucracies and state regulations, they argued, suffocated private investment and distorted prices making developing economies extraordinarily inefficient. In their view, the ills of unbalanced growth, dependency, etc. were all ascribed to too much government dirigisme, not too little. In recent years, the Neoclassical thesis has gained greater adherence, particularly in Latin America. However, the evidence is still ambivalent and disputed. Both structuralists and counter-structuralists point to fast East Asian development and disastrous African experience as proofs of their directly opposing theses.

Finance Theory," Finance theory has a surprisingly short history in economics.   Economists have long been aware of the basic economic function of credit markets but they were not keen on analyzing it much further than that.  As such, early ideas about financial markets were largely intuitive, mostly formulated by practitioners.   Pioneering theoretical work on financial markets, notably that of Louis Bachelier (1900), tended to be basically ignored by theoreticians and practitioners alike. Portfolio Theory This does not mean that the early economists ignored financial markets.   Henry C. Emery (1896) and Irving Fisher (1906, 1907, 1930) had already outlined the basic functions of credit markets for economic activity --  specifically as a way of allocating resources over time.  Both had recognized the role of risk in the process and the importance of speculative activity in risk-bearing and channeling information through prices.  In developing their theories of money, John Maynard Keynes (1930, 1936), John Hicks (1934, 1935, 1939), Nicholas Kaldor (1939) and Jacob Marschak (1938) had already conceived of portfolio selection theory in which uncertainty played an important role.   However, for many economists during this early period, financial markets were still regarded as mere ""casinos"" rather than ""markets"" properly speaking.   In their view, asset prices were determined largely by expectations and counter-expectations of capital gains and thus they were ""held up by their own bootstraps"" as it were.  John Maynard Keynes's ""beauty contest"" analogy is representative of this attitude.   As such, a good amount of ink was spent on the topic of speculative activity (i.e. the purchase/temporary sale of goods or assets for later resale), a topic first brought up into serious discussion by Henry C. Emery (1896).  In their pioneering work on futures markets, John Maynard Keynes (1923, 1930) and John Hicks (1939)  argued that the price of  a futures contract for delivery of a commodity will be generally below the expected spot price of that commodity (what Keynes called ""normal backwardation"").  This, Keynes and Hicks argued, was largely because hedgers shifted their price risk onto speculators in return for a risk premium.  Nicholas Kaldor (1939) went on to analyze the question of whether speculation was successful in stabilizing prices and, in so doing, expanded Keynes's theory of liquidity preference considerably.  (In later years, Holbrook Working (1953, 1962)  would dispute this, arguing that there was, in fact, no difference between the motivations of hedgers and speculators.  This led to an early empirical race -- Hendrik Houthakker (1957, 1961, 1968, 1969) finding evidence in favor of normal backwardation and Lester Telser (1958, 1981) finding evidence against it.) John Burr Williams (1938) was among the first to challenge the ""casino"" view economists held of financial markets and questions of asset pricing.  He argued that asset prices of financial assets reflected the ""intrinsic value"" of an asset, which can be measured by the discounted stream of future expected dividends from the asset.   This ""fundamentalist"" notion fit well with Irving Fisher's (1907, 1930) theory, and the ""value-investing"" approach of practitioners such as Benjamin Graham.    Harry Markowitz (1952, 1959) realized that as the ""fundamentalist"" notion relied on expectations of the future, then the element of risk must come into play and thus profitable use could be made of the newly developed expected utility theory of John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern (1944).  Markowitz formulated the theory of optimal portfolio selection in the context of trade-offs between risk and return, focusing on the idea of portfolio diversification as a method of reducing risk -- and thus began what has become known as ""Modern Portfolio Theory"" or simply MPT. As noted, the idea of an optimal portfolio allocation had already been considered by Keynes, Hicks and Kaldor in their theories of money, and thus it was a logical step for James Tobin (1958) to add money to Markowitz's story and thus obtain the famous ""two-fund separation theorem"".  Effectively, Tobin argued that agents would diversify their savings between a risk-free asset (money) and a single portfolio of risky assets (which would be the same for everyone).  Different attitudes towards risk, Tobin contended, would merely result in different combinations of money and that unique portfolio of risky assets. The Markowitz-Tobin theory was not very practical.  Specifically, to estimate the benefits of diversification would require that practitioners calculate the covariance of returns between every pair of assets.  In their Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), William Sharpe (1961, 1964) and John Lintner (1965) solved this practical difficulty by demonstrating that one could achieve the same result merely by calculating the covariance of every asset with respect to a general market index.   With the necessary calculating power reduced to computing these far fewer terms (""betas""), optimal portfolio selection became computationally feasible.   It was not long before practitioners embraced the CAPM. The CAPM would be eventually challenged empirically in a series of papers by Richard Roll (1977, 1978). One of the alternatives offered up was the ""intertemporal CAPM"" (ICAPM) of Robert Merton (1973).  Merton's approach and the assumption of rational expectations led the way to the Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1985) partial differential equation for asset prices and, perhaps only a step away, Robert E. Lucas's (1978) theory of asset pricing. A more interesting alternative was the ""Arbitrage Pricing Theory"" (APT) of Stephen A. Ross (1976).  Stephen  Ross's APT approach moved away from the risk vs. return logic of the CAPM, and exploited the notion of ""pricing by arbitrage"" to its fullest possible extent.  As Ross himself has noted, arbitrage-theoretic reasoning is not unique to his particular theory but is in fact the underlying logic and methodology of virtually all of finance theory.  The following famous financial theorems illustrate Ross's point. The famous theory of option pricing by Fisher Black and Myron Scholes (1973) and  Robert Merton (1973) relies heavily on the use of arbitrage reasoning.  Intuitively, if the returns from an option can be replicated by a portfolio of other assets, then the value of the option must be equal to the value of that portfolio, or else there will be arbitrage opportunities.   Arbitrage logic was also used by M. Harrison and David M. Kreps (1979) and Darrell J. Duffie and Chi-Fu Huang (1985) to value multi-period (i.e. ""long-lived"") securities. All this spills over into the Neo-Walrasian theories of   general equilibrium with asset markets (complete and incomplete) developed by Roy Radner (1967, 1968, 1972), Oliver D. Hart (1975) and many others since.   The famous Modigliani-Miller theorem (or ""MM"") on the irrelevance of corporate financial structure for the value of the firm also employs arbitrage logic.   This famous theorem Franco Modigliani and Merton H. Miller (1958, 1963) can actually be thought of as an extension of the  ""Separation Theorem"" originally developed by Irving Fisher (1930).  Effectively, Fisher had argued that with full and efficient capital markets, the production decision of an entrepreneur-owned firm ought to be independent of the intertemporal consumption decision of the entrepreneur himself.  This translates itself into saying that the profit-maximizing production plan of the firm will not be affected by the borrowing/lending decisions of its owners, i.e. the production plan is independent of the financing decision.  Modigliani-Miller extended this proposition via arbitrage logic. Viewing firms as assets, if the underlying production plans of differently-financed firms are the same, then the market value of the firms will be the same for, if not, there is an arbitrage opportunity there for the taking.   Consequently, arbitrage enforces that the value of the firms to be identical, whatever the composition of the firm's financial structure.   Efficient Markets Hypothesis The second important strand of work on finance was the empirical analysis of asset prices.  A particularly disturbing finding was that it seemed that prices tended to follow a random walk.   More specifically, as documented already by Louis Bachelier (1900) (for commodity prices) and later confirmed in further studies by Holbrook Working (1934) (for a variety of price series), Alfred Cowles (1933, 1937) (for American stock prices) and Maurice G. Kendall (1953) (for British stock and commodity prices), it seemed as there was no correlation between successive price changes on asset markets. The Working-Cowles-Kendall  empirical findings were greeted with horror and disbelief by economists.  If prices are determined by the ""forces of supply and demand"", then price changes should move in particular direction towards market clearing and not randomly.   Not everyone was displeased with these results, however.  Many viewed them as proof that the ""fundamentalist"" theory was incorrect, i.e. that financial markets really were wild casinos and that finance was thus not a legitimate object of economic concern.  Yet others crowed that it proved the failure of  traditional ""statistical"" methods to illuminate much of anything.   High-powered time series methods were used by Clive Granger and Oskar Morgenstern (1963) and Eugene F. Fama (1965, 1970), but they came up with the same randomness result. The great breakthrough was due to Paul A. Samuelson (1965) and Benoit Mandelbrot (1966).  Far from proving that financial markets did not work according to the laws of economics, Samuelson interpreted the Working-Cowles-Kendall findings as saying that they worked all too well!  The basic notion was simple: if price changes were not random (and thus forecastable), then any profit-hungry arbitrageur can easily make appropriate purchases and sales of assets to exploit this.  Samuelson and Mandelbrot thus posited the celebrated ""Efficient Market Hypothesis"" (EMH): namely, if markets are working properly, then all public (and, in some versions, private) information regarding an asset will be channelled immediately into its price. (note that the term ""efficient"", as it is used here, merely means that agents are making full use of the information available to them; it says nothing about other types of ""economic efficiency"", e.g. efficiency in the allocation of  resources in production, etc.).   If price changes seem random and thus unforecastable it is because  investors are doing their jobs: all arbitrage opportunities have already been exploited to the extent to which they can be. The ""Efficient Markets Hypothesis"" was made famous by Eugene Fama (1970) and later connected to the rational expectations hypothesis of New Classical macroeconomics.   It did not please many practioners.  ""Technical"" traders or ""chartists"" who believed they could forecast asset prices by examining the patterns of price movements were confounded: the EMH told them that they could not ""beat the market"" because any available information would already be incorporated in the price.  It also had the potential to annoy some fundamentalist practioners: the idea of efficient markets rests on ""information"" and ""beliefs"", and thus does not, at least in principle, rule out the possibility of speculative bubbles based on rumor, wrong information and the ""madness of crowds"". More disturbingly, the EMH has not pleased economists. EMH is probably one of the more resiliant empirical propositions around (albeit, see Robert Shiller's (1981) critique), yet it does not seem to have a clearly sound theoretical standing.  It all seems to collapse on one particular objection: namely, that if all information is already contained in prices and investors are fully rational, then not only can one not profit from using one's information, indeed, there might not be any trade at all! These peculiar, contradictory implications of rational expectations were demonstrated by Sanford J. Grossman and Joseph E. Stiglitz (1980) and Paul Milgrom and Nancy Stokey (1982).  Intuitively, the objection can be put this way (and here we are oversimplifying a bit).  The efficient markets hypothesis effectively implies that there is ""no free lunch"", i.e. there are no $100 bills lying on the pavement because, if there were, someone would have picked them up already.  Consequently, there is no point in looking down at the pavement (especially if there is a cost to looking down).  But if everyone reasons this way, no one looks down at the pavement, then any $100 bills that might be lying there will not be picked up by anyone.   But then there are $100 bills lying on the pavement and one should look down.  But then if everyone realizes that, they will look down and pick up the $100 bills, and thus we return to the first stage and argue that there are not any $100 bills (and therefore no point in looking down, etc.)  This circularity of reasoning is what makes the theoretical foundations of the efficient markets hypothesis somewhat shaky.

Game Theory," Game Theory has emerged recently as a powerful challenger to the conventional method of examining economics. Although many illustrious predecessors worked on problems in what can be called ""game theory"", the fundamental, formal conception of game theory as part and parcel of economic theory were first organized in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's 1944 classic, Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944).  The main purpose of game theory is to consider situations where instead of agents making decisions as reactions to exogenous prices (""dead variables""), their decisions are strategic reactions to other agents actions (""live variables""). An agent is faced with a set of moves he can play and will form a strategy, a best response to his environment, which he will play by. Strategies can be either ""pure"" (i.e. play a particular move) or ""mixed"" (random play). A "" Nash Equilibrium"" will be reached when each agent's actions begets a reaction by all the other agents which, in turn, begets the same initial action. In other words, the best responses of all players are in accordance with each other. Game Theory can be roughly divided into two broad areas: non-cooperative (or strategic) games and co-operative (or coalitional) games. The meaning of these terms are self evident, although John Nash claimed that one should be able to reduce all co-operative games into some non-cooperative form. This position is what is known as the ""Nash Programme"". Within the non-cooperative literature, a distinction can also be made between ""normal"" form games (static) and ""extensive"" form games (dynamic). John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern (1944) introduced the strategic normal game, strategic extensive game, the concept of pure/mixed strategies, coalitional games as well as the axiomatization of expected utility theory, which was so useful for economics under uncertainty. They employed the ""maximin"" solution concept derived earlier by John von Neumann (1928) to solve simple strategic, zero-sum normal games.  In 1950, John Nash introduced the concept of a ""Nash Equilibrium"" (NE), which became the organizing concept under Game Theory -- even though the concept actually stretched as far back as Cournot (1838). Nash followed this up in 1951 with the concept of a ""Nash Bargaining Solution"" (NBS) for coalitional games. Then the floodgates opened for the refinement of Nash Equilibrium. In the field of non-cooperative games, R. Duncan Luce and Howard Raiffa (1957) provided the first popular textbook on game theory and, in it, they formalized the idea of the Iterated Elimination of Dominated Strategies (IEDS) method for Strategic Normal Games and introduced the concept of ""Repeated Game"" (static games which are played several times over). H.W. Kuhn (1953) introduced extensive games with ""imperfect information"" (i.e. where one does not know what moves have already been played by other players). William Vickrey (1961) provided the first formalization of ""auctions"". Reinhard Selten (1965) developed the concept of a ""Subgame Perfect Equilibrium"" (SPE) (i.e. elimination by backward induction) as a refined solution for extensive form games. John C. Harsanyi (1967-8) developed the concept of a ""Bayesian Nash Equilibrium"" (BNE) for Bayesian games (i.e. games with incomplete information - where there is some uncertainty surrounding moves, or where ""nature"" plays as well.) In coalitional (co-operative) games further refinements also occurred. Lloyd Shapley (1953) introduced the concept of the ""Shapley Value"" and the ""Core"" (which had been originally conceived by F.Y. Edgeworth (1881)) as solutions to Coalitional Games. Throughout the early 1960s, Robert J. Aumann and Martin Shubik began to apply cooperative game theory extensively throughout economics (e.g. industrial organization, general equilibrium, monetary theory, etc.), and, in the process, went on to invent several solution concepts for coalitional games (e.g. Bargaining Set, Strong Equilibrium), ""large games"" with infinite players and early statements of the ""Folk Theorems"" (solution concepts for Repeated Games). David Schmeidler (1969) developed the ""Nucleolus"" solution for coalitional games. Further developments emerged in the 1970s. John C. Harsanyi (1973) provided a remarkably insightful new interpretation of the concept of a ""mixed strategy"". Robert J. Aumann (1974) defined ""Correlated Equilibrium"" for Bayesian Games while Reinhard Selten (1975) introduced ""Trembling Hand Equilibrium"" for Bayesian Games. Further definitions came: Robert J. Aumann (1976) formally defined the concept of ""Common Knowledge"", opening a floodgate of literature, while B.D. Bernheim and D.G. Pearce (1984) formalized the concept of ""rationalizability"". Advancements continued apace: David M. Kreps and Robert Wilson (1982) introduced the concept of ""Sequential Equilibrium"" (SEQE) for extensive games with imperfect information.   Ariel Rubinstein (1982), following an early insight by Frederik Zeuthen (1930), transformed the co-operative Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) into a non-cooperative strategic extensive game of sequential bargaining. Elon Kohlberg and Jean-Fran√ßois Mertens (1986) developed the concept of ""Forward Induction"" for extensive games. Drew Fudenberg and E.S. Maskin (1986) developed one of the more famous ""Perfect Folk Theorems"" for infinitely repeated games. Finally, J.C. Harsanyi and R.Selten (1988) developed the idea of ""equilibrium selection"" for any type of game while D. Fudenberg and Jean Tirole (1991) developed the ""Bayesian Perfect Equilibrium"" (BPE) for Extensive Bayesian Games . Evolutionary game theory started its development slightly later.  Its objective is to apply the concepts of non-cooperative game theory to explain such phenomena which are often thought to be the result of cooperation or human design - i.e. ""institutions"" and ""conventions"" such as market formation, price mechanisms, social rules of conduct, money and credit, etc. One of the earliest exponents of the theory of evolutionary games was Thomas C. Schelling (1960, 1981) who argued that apparently ""cooperative"" social institutions (in this case, settlements to conflicts) are maintained by essentially by ""threats"" of punishment and retaliation  This has been followed up particularly in the 1990s.. Several Nobel Prizes have been awarded to some of major figures of Game Theory: the Nobel was shared by John Nash, J.C. Harsanyi and R. Selten in 1994 and William Vickrey and James Mirrlees in 1996. Herbert Simon won the Nobel in 1979 for concepts (e.g. bounded rationality) which have since been incorporated into the corpus of (Evolutionary) Game Theory.

Medieval Universities,"      List of Medieval Universities   Date Name Manner Country Charter(s) Notes
10th C. [Salerno] Spontaneous Italy   First university, in the sense of a higher-learning, degree-awarding institute, the oldest referred to as a Studium Generale, however limited to a Medical School (Scola medica salernitana) for much of its duration.  Its origins are obscure. Legend claims it was founded by four physicians (a Latin, a Greek, an Arab and a Jew), bringing the medical traditions of four great Mediterranean civilizations into one location.  First mention of its doctors appear in 848  (at the time, the independent Lombard Duchy of Salerno), its fame and repute was already widespread before 946 and quite frequent by 1050.  Its preeminent doctor was probably Constantinus Africanus (fl. 1080s), who introduced translations of Arabic and Greek medical writings into the standard curriculum . Salerno was a professor-based collegium, rather than a student-based universitas.  Emperor Frederick II tried to establish a nearby university in Naples in 1224, with its own medical school, but it was overshadowed by the traditional grandeur of Salerno, so he (nearly) gave it up.  Frederick II issued an edict in 1231 forbidding the teaching of medicine without a royal license, and stipulated that such a license would only be granted after examination by the Doctors of Salerno.  An ordinance deeming Liberal Arts a preliminary requirement for medical students was followed up with an edict in 1243 transferring the remaining colleges of Naples to Salerno, and requiring Licences and Inception of Salerno doctors to be carried out in the royal court.   Salerno's development into a proper, multi-faculty university was stopped and reversed by the subsequent Angevin rulers, who transferred the non-medical colleges back to Naples and forbade anything but medicine to be taught at Salerno.  This prohibition (in place until 1490) compromised the growth of Salerno, and it gradually dwindled and all but disappeared by the 15th Century.   It was rescued by the arrival of the Sanseverino princes of Salerno in 1463, who promptly revived the medical school, and sponsored its expansion to other fields, like law and philosophy, and had fully-fleshed faculties by 1592 (Grendler 2011: p.117).   The University of Salerno continued until it was suppressed by Napoleon's decree in 1811. The modern university of Salerno was founded in 1968. (Rashdall, v.1, p.76)
1088 Bologna Spontaneous Italy   The Alma Mater Studiorum ('Mother of Studies'), oldest European university in continuous existence, the Studium Generale par excellence. A laical school (Studium) was established here around 1088 by the jurist Irnerius, shortly after his recovery of the Justinian Code (Corpus Juris Civilis), turning his school into the epicenter of the study of Civil Law.  Another Bologna jurist, Gratian, compiled the Decretum in 1142, founding the field of Canon Law. Students who arrived in Bologna organized into student associations, known as universitas.  Imperial decree of 1158 acknowledges such associations.  Organized into four nations (""Lombard"", ""Tuscan"", ""Roman"" and ""Ultramontane""), which were subsequently divided into sub-nations. As student associations paid the salaries of the professors, they controlled the university and could threaten ""secession"" (i.e. moving the entire university to another city). A society of masters, a distinct  college of professors of civil and canon law, is first mentioned in 1215. Seceding Bologna students created other universities elsewhere (e.g. Vicenza, Arezzo, Padua, Siena, Pisa).   By these means, student associations could blackmail city authorities who did not want to lose business brought by the rich students. In the course of the 13th C., the students and the city struggled for control of the professors' salaries, the city eventually winning out. By 1350, civil authorities were paying all professor salaries out of communal taxes, and thus acquired the power to keep the university in place, and thereby control, regulate and enforce practically everything about it (appointments, curriculum, etc.).   Although Bologna would add other faculties, law remained its principal strength and Bologna was the preeminent Law School of Medieval Europe.  A Studium generale by strength of reputation, Bologna did not bother to apply for a papal charter.  Its statutes got its first papal confirmation in 1253. [R]
c.1150 Paris Spontaneous France
  Origins obscure. Many separate schools existed in Paris already by the late 11th C.  Cradle of the University of Paris were three schools: those of the Palais Royal, the Notre Dame cathedral and the abbey of Sainte-Genevi√®ve (to which is often added the school of the abbey of Saint-Victor, where Pierre Abelard taught in the early 1100s).  The triple-cradle schools were organized around 1150 into a Parisian guild of masters and students (''universitas magistrorum et scholarium Parisensis''). Royal charter was granted by Philip II Augustus of France in 1200, confirmed by Pope Innocent III in 1215, although it was really the Parens scientiarum bull of Pope Gregory IX (1231), two years after a famous student strike of 1229, that gave the university its independence and constitutional structure. Its most famous college, the Sorbonne, was started as a residence in 1257. Logic and theology was the principal strength of Paris and although it would spawn worthy rivals (most famously, Oxford), the University of Paris remained the preeminent Theology School in Medieval Europe and ground zero of Medieval Scholasticism. [R]
1167 Oxford Migration England   Although studying of some sort is reported already in the 11th C., and local legend proclaims Alfred of Wessex as its founder c.886,  the common founding date is considered to be 1167, when English masters and students were expelled from Paris in the course of a political quarrel, and re-gathered at Oxford.   Oxford narrowly survived the 1539 dissolution of the monasteries by subjecting itself to royal reorganization. The 1571 Elizabethan act of incorporation gave it its first formal charter.  Oldest constituent college still in existence is University College, founded by in 1249, although St. Edmund's Hall (f.1236, but not a college) challenges that title.  Balliol (f.1263) and Merton (f.1264) also lay claim [Rasdhall v.2, pt.2] 
 before 1181 Montpellier Spontaneous France Lord, 1181;
Papal, 1289 Second oldest in France. Law school founded here by Bologna glosser Placentinus c. 1160. Initially lured to Mantua, Placentinus proceeded to Montpellier. The existence of a Medical School (possibly started as an outpost of Salerno, which it would eventually rival) is confirmed  in a charter in 1181 from William VIII, Lord of Montpellier authorizing anyone to teach medicine here, and was given formal statutes by Cardinal Conrad von Urach in 1220. Received papal charter with bull Quia Sapientia  from Pope Nicholas IV in 1289 (one of the first elevations with jus ubique docendi explicitly stated), formally uniting the two schools with a faculty of theology raised from the local cathedral school (where St. Anthony of Padua taught, c.1220).  Although Montpellier's law school was eventually eclipsed by Orleans and Toulouse, it remained unchallenged as the pre-eminent medical school in France.  It was partitioned into three universities in 1968.[R]
c.1182 [Modena] (disputed) Spontaneous Italy   Founded by Bologna jurist Pillius.  There are already existed an old 9th C. Carolingian School of Rhetoric here.  Although Modena is often claimed to be a Studium Generale, this is not accepted by all historians (e.g. Rashdall  (v.2, p.5-6) acknowledges the existence of a school in Modena in this period, but does not find evidence of graduation).  The post-Medieval University of Modena was chartered in 1683 by Francesco II d'Este, Duke of Modena.
1188 [Reggio] Migration Italy   Founded by uncertain migration of students from somewhere (probably Bologna), led by teacher Jacopo da Mandra, lured by the communal authorities of Reggio-in-Emilia.  Referred to as Studium Generale by 1210, but gradually deprecated and defunct by the 15th C.  A post-Medieval University of Reggio was re-founded in 1752 by Francesco III d'Este, Duke of Modena, but by 1772, it was forbidden to grant degrees and relegated to a lyceum.  In 1998 a new university of Reggio was founded, as a branch of Modena, now rebranded as the ""University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"". [R]
1204 [Vicenza] Migration Italy   The establishment of a Carolingian Law School in Vicenza was ordered already by Lothair I's 825 Capitulary of Corteolona.  First university founded by definitive migration (""secession"") of students from Bologna.  Promptly recognized as a Studium Generale, but very short-lived.  Defunct by 1209.  There were attempts to revive it later in the early 1400s - a petition was submitted to (anti-)Pope John XXIII, but to no avail.  [R]
1209 Cambridge Migration England Royal, 1291
Papal, 1318 Founded by migration (""secession"") of students from Oxford in 1209 after a town-versus-gown quarrel.  Recognized as SG by 1229, it was granted a royal charter by Edward I in 1291 and papal bull Inter Singula by Pope John XXII  in 1318. Oldest constituent college still in existence, Peterhouse (orig. St. Peter's College), was founded by the Bishop of Ely in 1284.[Rashdall, vol. 2.2]
1212 [Palencia] Royal charter Castile
(Spain) Royal, 1212
Papal, 1263 First university founded by royal charter, issued 1212 or 1214 by Alfonso VIII of Castile, at instigation of Bishop Tello Tellez de Menezes of Palencia. Charter invites foreign teachers and offers royal salaries, endowed with share of royal tithes.  Elevated from a prior existing cathedral school (where St. Dominic had studied c.1184).  But unable to compete with rising Salamanca and Valladolid, and basically extinct by 1250.  Granted papal charter 1263 in effort to revive it, but apparently to no avail.[R]
1215 [Arezzo] Migration Italy Imperial, 1355 Founded by migration of masters (not students) from Bologna, led by Roffredo di Benevento. University statutes date from 1255. Dwindled afterwards, but received influx of Bologna students in 1338 after a papal interdict. Received imperial charter from Emperor Charles IV in 1355, but began declining again.  Attempts to revive in the early 15th C. did not go far, and was defunct shortly after.  The modern University of Siena opened a branch in Arezzo in 1969.  [R]
1222 Padua Migration Italy Papal, 1346 Arguably Bologna's keenest rival. Teaching already recorded in the 12th C., firmly founded by migration (""secession"") of students from Bologna in 1222 after a town-versus-gown quarrel over professor salaries. Sufficiently populous to spawn its own student colony in Vercelli (1228).  Depopulated by the depredations of Ezzelino da Romano, it was revived in 1262 by a new influx of students from Bologna and organization into two nations (Citramontane, Ultramontane), approved by papal bull in 1264.  A recognized Studium Generale by custom,  Padua's SG privileges were confirmed in a 1346 papal bull by Pope Clement V. It received further influxes from Bologna in the 1306 and 1321, and struggled for a while to maintain an independent identity rather than simply Bologna-in-exile.  First college was the Collegium Tornacense (1363). After a period under the lordship of the Carrara family (f.1322), Padua was annexed by the Republic of Venice in 1404, and the university became a flagship for the republic, which presided over its growth. Venetian citizens were forbidden to study elsewhere, while Venetian tolerance and protection from papal reaction attracted many foreign students. [R]
1224 Naples Imperial charter Italy Imperial, 1224, 1258 The University of Naples was the first university founded by imperial charter - indeed, Palencia aside, the first university with any charter (the pope had not yet begun handing out his own charters yet).  It was erected in 1224 by Emperor Frederick II to raise a stable of bureaucrats, jurists and clerics for his dominions and the Ghibelline cause (the emperor was deeply at odds with Guelf Bologna).  Naples was probably also the first Studium Generale to be built from scratch, rather than upon a pre-existing school.  That meant severe growing problems. Lack of academic tradition implied difficulty attracting students (St. Thomas Aquinas was one of the few).  It also had to compete with the well-established school of nearby Salerno, and for a brief spell, the entire university of Naples was shut down and moved to Salerno.  It was only with the  the university's ""second founding"" in 1258, and the careful doting of the new Angevin rulers of Naples (who arrived in 1266), did the university begin to get traction. However, it did not have independence -  until 1497, the university was under the superintendence of a royal high official in the Neapolitan court, and diplomas handed out in the king's name.  As a creature of the State, it played little role in the Scholastic era.  [R]
1228 [Vercellli] Migration Italy   Founded by migration of students from Padua (not Bologna) in 1228, who negotiated better terms from the Vercelli city authorities.  Despite its initial sizeable influx, it dwindled with time, and was defunct by the late 14th. [R]
c.1229 Angers Migration France royal, 1364 Old cathedral school, taught by masters from Chartres in early 11th C., which may have formed kernel.  Angers obtained influx from the Parisian exodus of 1229 (Anjou outside jurisdiction of King of France).  Law school developed here thereafter, almost as famous as Orleans. Firmly under control of Bishop of Angers, referred to as Studium Generale by 1337.  Never got papal bull and only finally got royal charter in 1364 from Charles V, but long recognized as SG by custom. Diocesal statutes in 1373, Angers students revolt against diocesal control in 1389 and appeal to the Parlement. With Parlementary mediation, Angers reorganized 1398 along lines of Orleans.  Law school only until 1432, when Arts and Theology established by bull of Pope Eugenius IV. Powers of students reduced in 1494.  [R]
ante 1230 Salamanca Royal charter Leon
(Spain) royal, 1242
papal, 1255 Founded c. 1220 by Alfonso VIII of Leon before his death in 1230. Uncertain how, no known charter. ""Re-founded"" by Ferdinand III of Castile-Leon in 1242 with new charter.  Ascension presided over by Alfonso X the Wise, who expand privileges and royal patronage in 1254 charter, confirmed by 1255 papal bull of Alexander IV (which recognizes that SG already exists, and merely confirms royal privileges, not upgrades them)  Studium schools formally remained under cathedral authority, whose powers were greater than elsewhere, and no autonomous powers given to guilds of masters and students (masters guild limited  to assist bishop & chancellor in examinations and inceptions).  Diplomas handed out in the name of both king and pope.  Secularized 1845.  [Alfonso X's 1263 ""code"" of Siete Partidas"" contains first explicit definition of SG:
- Particular: with one master, est. by town council or prelate
- General: separate master for each seven arts (at minimum Grammar, Logic and Rhetoric), plus one master of laws and one master of decrees, AND can only be established by Pope, Emperor or King, and salaries fixed by latter.(insistence on king unusual - he cannot give jus ubique docendi)
- 1263 act recognizes existence of university as autonomous, defines it as union of professors and students, who elect Rector; also notes it is an exception to regulations against guilds. Rector enforces punishment, and if not, then criminal offenses are province of king, civil offenses of bishop.
- Civil law more prominent, outshine theology. Doctors of Civil Law are deemed ""Caballeros"", entitled to sit on the bench in any court, and attains rank of ""Count"" after 20 years service.
- Alfonso X provide 2500 maravedis annually for salaries.
- First to give Music degrees. [R]
ante 1231 Orleans Migration France papal, 1306 Existence of a Carolingian school of law c.830, and a school of letters (grammar, rhetoric) in 12th C., but continuity unclear. Orleans was destination of students expelled from Paris in 1229.  Erection of School of Law at Orleans definitely by 1235, quickly becoming most prominent French university for civil and canon law (civil law was forbidden in Paris since 1219) and SG by custom. Statutes in place c.1288, controlled by Bishop of Orleans in 1301, bull obtained 1306 from Pope Clement V (based on Toulouse) limiting jurisdiction of diocese over the university.  Town vs. gown quarrel in 1309 decided in favor of town by king Philip IV in 1312, who stripped them of their university rights. University defected en masse to Nevers in 1316 (Duchy of Burgundy). Philip V imposed compromise on town in 1320, and scholars returned to Orleans.  Flourished thereafter, however, no evidence of any other colleges in Orleans during the Middle Ages, only a law school down to 1440s.  [R]
1230/33 Toulouse Papal charter France Papal, 1233, 1245 This is the first university created by papal charter.  Idea long-promoted by Pope Honorius III to bring Catholic theologians into the heart of Albigensian Languedoc.  Became feasible after dispersal of Paris in 1229. In peace treaty of early 1230 between count Raymond of Toulouse and Louis IX, Raymond promised to fund fourteen professorships, and initial schools probably set up by the Parisian exiles, particularly Dominicans, like grammarian John of Garland and theologian Roland of Cremona, with assistance from papal legate.  So Toulouse really established as a school by migration - even if the migration was ""managed from above"".  But the opposition of the heretical city authorities, Raymond's refusal to meet salary obligations and the imminent resolution of the Paris conflict, endangered the continuation of Toulouse's schools. This prompted Pope Gregory IX to issue a papal bull for Toulouse in 1233, granting jus ubique docendi rights, dispensation from residence, and similar privileges and immunities of Paris.  Success was only really achieved after 1239, when excommunication forced Raymond to cough up the promised salaries and the city authorities were brought into obedience after a rough inquisition. A new papal bull in 1245 by Innocent IV confirmed the charter. Through its first century, Toulouse was primarily a School of Law - the Orleans of the South. Although the teaching of Aristolean philosophy had been permitted from the outset, and it was implicitly authorized to grant theology degrees, Toulouse refrained from doing so, leaving Paris with a monopoly on theology for a while. Toulouse only organized a theology faculty and began granting theology degrees after a 1360 bull of Innocent VI (himself a Toulouse graduate).  Toulouse gradually emerged as a rival to Paris in theology during the Great Schism, when it stood steadfastly by the pope in opposing Gallicanism.  [R]
1244/45 Curia Romana Papal charter Italy Papal, 1244/5 In 1244-45, Pope Innocence IV issued a bull creating the Studium Romanae Curiae (University of the Roman Court), endowing it with the privileges of a Studium Generale,  essentially with the idea that the papal court needed its own school of Civil and Canon Law separate from Bologna. Masters in its small theological faculty were necessarily regulars, usually Dominicans, a condition harking back to Honorius III's Masters of the Sacred College.  It was governed by a College of Doctors, directly under the pope. Residency requirements were usually dispensed with, and degrees granted by papal bull. As they carried the right to teach anywhere with minimal effort, degrees from the Roman Court were often a source of ecclesiastical patronage.   It is commonly asserted this university is distinct, and prior to, the Studium Romanae Urbis (University of the City of Rome - La Sapienza), whose founding is usually dated 1303.  According to some historians (e.g. Rashdall), the Roman Court school was was an unusual, migratory Studium Generale, its teachers moved with the pope's person. So the Roman Court school moved with the Pope to Avignon, and then back to Rome on his return later, and that it existed alongside, but separate, from the proper universities of both Rome and Avignon.  However, other historians have doubted they it was that distinct. As there is little evidence of any teaching going on, some historians have argued the Roman Court university was nothing more than a degree-granting institution. Others have gone further, and suggested it is just an early name for the Sapienza university in Rome, that the two studia, Romanae Curiae and Romanae Urbis, refer to the same university, and thus the Sapienza's founding should be backdated to 1244/45. (e.g. Grendler, 2011: p.56)  However it is partitioned, it does seem the Roman Court school did merge with the Roman City school in the course of the 15th C.  and disappeared as a separate institution. [R, Gymnasio Romano, D]
1246 Siena Migration Italy Imperial, 1357;
Papal, 1408 Migration of students from Bologna in 1246, lured by Siena city authorities. In 1252, Pope Innocent IV appointed bishop of the Siena as conservator of the students.  But students gone back to Bologna by 1275, when civil resolution passed to revive it, but probably didn't go anywhere.  In 1321, Bologna exiles in Imola were lured to Siena by Sienese agents, but gone again after crisis resolved.  In 1338, Bologna interdict allowed Siena to get a serious influx, but unable to get a papal charter (essential by now).  Siena finally obtained an imperial charter from Emperor Charles IV in 1357 declaring a Studium Generale de novo, that had fallen on hard times.  Papal charter granted 1408 by Pope Gregory XII.   [R]
1248 [Piacenza] Papal charter Italy Papal, 1248 First Italian town school elevated to a Studium generale.  Placentinus (of Montpellier) moved to Piacenza in late life and founded law school.  Town applied for charter from Pope Innocent IV to elevate his Studium particular to Studium generale in 1248 (first such application) [first school not designed to advance papal/imperial agenda to be given bull;  granted ""privileges of Paris"", implying jus ubique but not explicit]. Despite that,  not much success until  Gian Galeazzo Visconti suppressed Pavia in 1398 and made Piacenza the sole university of the Duchy of Milan.  Despite lavish attentions, experiment failed and later Visconti transferred university back to Pavia in 1414. Piacenza lingered on a little longer, essentially as a cheap degree-mill. [R]
c.1250 Valladolid (Papal in 1260)     Foundation obscure, as there are hardly any records before 14th C. A town school in Valladolid (no bishop) existed for some time, although probably not very important (goes unmentioned while Palencia continues to be doted upon by Castilian kings until the mid-13th).  But by 1293 Valladolid is spoken of as significant (foundation of Alcala in 1293 with ""privileges of Valladolid""), so Rasdhall estimates sometime in mid-13th.  In 1304, Ferdinand IV refers to Valladolid as an existing SG and grants it significant subsidy.  But Pope Clement VI refers to is a studium particular and elevates it to SG only in bull of 1346.  [R]
1254 Seville Royal charter   Royal, 1254
Papal, 1260 Studium in Seville for the study of Arabic works was already in operation by 1250.  Alfonso X the Wise granted a charter to Seville in 1254, similar to that of Salamanca.  1260 bull of Pope Alexander IV confirm Seville's status as Studium Generale. Subsequent history obscure, unclear if even existed.  [R]
1290 Lisbon-Coimbra Papal charter Portugal Papal, 1290 Founded in Lisbon 1290 by Denis of Portugal, and granted papal charter by Pope Nicholas IV that same year. Originally three faculties (Law, Arts, Medicine, but no Theology until 1388).  Moved to Coimbra in 1308, returned to Lisbon in 1338, back to Coimbra 1354, again to Lisbon 1377 and finally back to Coimbra permanently in 1537. [R]
1303 Rome (Studium Urbis - Sapienza) Papal charter Italy Papal,1303 Founded by 1303 bull Supremae praeminentia Dignitatis by Pope Boniface VIII (with many privileges, but surprisingly jus ubique not mentioned). Practically evaporated during Great Schism.  Effectively refounded in 1431 by Pope Eugenius IV, assigning wine tax for its maintenance. The Curiae and Urbis universities were merged  during the papacy of Leo X, and established in a building known as ""La Sapienza"".  Not very important in Middle Ages.[R]

1308 Perugia Spontaneous/
Papal charter Italy Papal, 1308;
Imperial, 1355. Perugia repeatedly hired professors to teach law (e.g. 1276), and a universitas of students already existed by 1308, when it received its first papal bull from Pope Clement V granting SG privileges.  New bull of 1318 from Pope John XXII allowed promotion to doctors of law, that of 1321 promotion of medicine and arts.  Got imperial charter in 1355 to reinforce it.  Enjoyed great fame after luring jurist Jacobus de Belviso in 1316, who in turn lured other civil and canon jurists, putting Perugia's law schools for a while on par with Bologna and Padua.  Theology college (Collegium Gregorianum), founded 1362,  became arguably the most prominent theology college in Italy at the time (although that is not saying much, since theology was largely ignored in Italian universities).  1457 statutes merged Citramontane (Rome, Tuscany, Marche, Sicily)  and Ultramontane (France, Germany, Catalonia) into one university, and merged Arts and Medicine into one college.  [R]
1318 [Treviso] Imperial charter Italy Imperial, 1318 Had an early Studium, revived by city authorities in 1267 after the fall of Ezzelino.  City went on hiring spree in 1314 and applied for papal bull, but didn't get one, so instead got an imperial charter in 1318 from anti-king Frederick I Hapsburg, Duke of Austria. University remained small, got a lift after Treviso was annexed by the Republic of Venice in 1339, but doomed when Venice also acquired Padua, and issued edict in 1407 forbidding Venetian citizens from studying anywhere but Padua.

1343 Pisa Papal charter Italy Papal,1343 Notable school existed here since late 12th C., expanded greatly with the 1338 exodus from Bologna. Pisa acquired SG privileges in 1343 bull In supremae dignitates of Pope Clement VI.  Proposition to redirect ecclesiastical revenues from diocese to pay for studium (common in Spain, unheard of in Italy) was refused by Pope Benedict XII, although Sixtus IV authorized a tax on clergy to support it.   Black Death dealt a huge blow in 1348, and the university was suspended after the Florentine conquest of Pisa in 1406.  In 1472, Lorenzo de Medici shut down the university in Florence and designated Pisa as the sole university of Tuscany. Grew rapidly after that. The Medici donated Pisa's grain exchange (Piazza del Grano) to erect Pisa's palatial Sapienza building for the university in 1492.    [R]

1349 Florence Papal charter Italy Papal, 1349;
Imperial, 1364 No trace of any old schools in Florence.  First attempt to erect a studium was in 1321, when Florentine agents were dispatched to lure exiled Bologna students (then camping in Imola) to relocate to Florence, but Sienese agents had reached them first, so only a few came.  Jealousy of Pisa provoked Florentine authorities to try again - Pope Clement VI granted Florence a SG bull for all faculties in 1349, 2500 florins were set aside to for expenses, and  a few big name professors,  like Baldus and Angelus di Perugia, were lured.  Nonetheless they soon went elsewhere, and the university failed to take root.   Florentine authorities issued law forbidding Florentine students from studying elsewhere, obtained a reinforcing imperial charter from Emperor Charles IV in 1364, established Europe's first chair of poetry (first held by Boccaccio, 1373) and first professorship of Greek (1396).  In 1429, it set up a ""domus sapientiae"" for poor students.  Pope Martin V approved a tax on ecclesiastical property to benefit the studium.  Nonetheless all these measures failed - probably because living costs in Renaissance Florence were simply too unaffordable for students.  The law school died out by the mid-15th C, and in 1472, Lorenzo de Medici finally put an end to the experiment, designating Pisa the only university in Tuscany. [R]

1361 Pavia Imperial charter Italy Imperial, 1361;
Papal, 1389 A Studium of Rhetoric (proto-Law School) attached to the royal Lombard palace in Pavia had already existed since the time of Lothair I (mentioned 825). Pavia became a notable center of Civil and Canon Law in the 11th C., but faded in the 12th C. as Bologna rose. Communal authorities of Pavia resurrected the law school to new heights in the early 14th C., but it was only formally chartered as a Studium Generale in 1361 by Emperor Charles IV (at the request of Galeazzo II Visconti) and, as a result, Pavia is commonly relegated to being founded after Bologna  (Pope Boniface IX gave Pavia a papal charter in 1389, which ignores the existence of the prior imperial charter).  In conjunction with the charter, in 1361, Galeazzo II Visconti forbade Milanese students from studying anywhere else.  This was reversed by Gian Galeazzo, who suppressed Pavia in 1398 in favor of Piacenza.  After death of Gian Galeazzo in 1402, Piacenza began to wither and Pavia was revived in 1412 by Filippo Maria Visconti. By 1421, it was fully operational and flourishing again. [R]

The marquis saddled the city of Ferrara with responsibility for paying expensively-promised professor salaries, which it was unable to afford.  Attempt to resurrect it in 1402 failed.  Real resurrection began in 1430, on the initiative of the Ferrara city government, who lured Bologna humanist John de Finotis to secede (with students) to Ferrara.  More lures and an elaborate reformation in 1442 turned it into a flourishing SG, albeit one with a reputation for ""cheap degrees"", the refuge of the destitute.   Governing council of reformatores were appointed partly by the Duke, partly by the city.[R]

Seeking to profit from the disorders during the break-up of the Milanese empire of Gian Galeazzo, which had kept students away, Turin set itself up as peaceful haven, hiring unemployed professors from Pavia and Piacenza.  It receive an imperial charter (which included theology) in 1412 from Emperor Sigismund, and another papal charter from anti-Pope John XXIII in1413.  University went into decline after death of Louis of Savoy in 1418, and by 1421 had de facto transferred to Chieri, formally so in 1427.  Moved to Saviliano in 1434, then back to Turin in 1436, with another charter by Duke Amadeus VIII of Savoy.  Duke appointed entire board of reformatores, and assign 2,000 florins from the salt tax, while city of Turin committed 500 florins.  The Collegio Grassi, a sapienza for poor scholars, was founded in 1457; another by Sixtus IV in 1482.  Turin was never a leading university in the Middle Ages, but improved in reputation in the late 15th C.   [R]

Ireland"," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by Cambridge University, nor its constituent colleges nor any other organization. See the official Cambridge University website] The University of Cambridge, alongside its great rival Oxford, is one of the ancient universities of England.  In the course of its history, the economics faculty at Cambridge has been arguably the single most influential faculty in the development of economics in the 20th Century. Structure Cambridge is a collegiate university, composed of 31 colleges, half of which have been founded since the 1880s.  The oldest extant college is Peterhouse (or St. Peter's College) which was founded in 1284 by the Bishop of Ely.  The largest and arguably most famous of its colleges is Trinity College (f.  1546 by Henry VIII), which nurtured Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton and other leading lights of the scientific revolution of the 17th C.  The powerful mathematics tradition at Trinity produced a second scientific revolution in the 19th C. under the leadership of William Whewell, which included Charles Babbage, Augustus de Morgan, Francis Galton, Arthur Cayley, James Clerk Maxwell and others.  Towards the end of the century, Trinity was also the home of the philosophers Alfred North Whitehead, Bertrand Russell, G.E. Moore and Henry Sidgwick.   But historians of economics are usually drawn to Trinity's great rival, King's College (f.1441 by Henry VI), the home of Arthur Cecil Pigou and John Maynard Keynes and crucible of the Keynesian revolution, and the post-Keynesian 'Cambridge School' of economics of  Richard F. Kahn, Nicholas Kaldor, Joan Robinson. Although Cambridge traditionally hosted a number of ""university professors"", usually one for each field, by and large, the job of educating the students was left to the constituent colleges, the central university merely providing the final examination and bestowing the degrees.  Each college had a stable of 'fellows' who acted as tutors and lecturers for the students. In principle, fellows were recent graduates that continued residing at the college to 'mentor' undergraduate. By statute, the fellows of a college were expected to be ordained into the Anglican priesthood after seven years.  However, a fellow who took up lecturing could retain the fellowship without ordination (although, until 1882, he was still required to remain unmarried.)   A fellowship was originally designed for only a few years for a small emolument, but its length increased greatly over time and better paid, becoming a quite comfortable career-long option.  To encourage resignations of fellows and open up spaces for 'new blood', colleges introduced a number of well-paid 'livings' (effectively, retirement pensions) available, competition for which was also quite stiff.  History Cambridge University was legendarily founded in 1209 by exiled scholars from Oxford. Cambridge was in full operation probably by 1229, and formally granted a royal charter by Edward I in 1291.  Its status as a Studium generale was confirmed by papal bull in 1318. Like monasteries and other church-related institutions, Cambridge was in danger of being seized during the Protestant reformation of Henry VIII in the 1530s. But the king decided to reform the university instead.  Endowments were overhauled and colleges were consolidated (famously King's Hall and Michaelhouse were merged to create Trinity College in 1546).  In 1540, Henry VIII had the crown create (and control) five professorial chairs, the 'Regius Professors' of Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Law and Medicine. (a crown chair in Divinity had already been endowed back in 1502). During the Henrican reforms, the traditional Catholic Scholastic curriculum was purged in favor of a more Humanistic one, marking the break with the Medieval  university.   Edward VI's Chantries Act of 1547, seizing revenues of church schools, specifically exempted Cambridge and Oxford.       Under Elizabeth I, Parliament passed the Act of Incorporation (1571), establishing the structure of Cambridge University, recasting it as a seminary for the Church of England and regulating the relationship between the central university and the constituent colleges.  The Elizabethan statutes were very detailed, down to curriculum and student life, and would remain unchanged until the 1856 Reform. The Tripos Through much of its history, Cambridge University was geared towards training clergy, and dominated by a Scholastic curriculum. By the Elizabethan statutes of the university, students were required in their first year to learn rhetoric, their second and third logic, and their fourth philosophy. Students obtained their undergraduate degrees after an oral examination, a Latin disputation to assess their language skills and mastery of Scholastic logic. In the course of the 17th C., the encroachment of vernacular teaching and the scientific revolution began whittling away at the importance of the disputation.  Around the 1730s, the newly-founded Senate House at Cambridge introduced the first  written examinations to students who had already met the statute requirements for graduation.  These Senate House examinations would become better known as the famous Tripos, a multi-day written examination ordeal in vernacular English.  The first two days of the Tripos were dedicated to Mathematics (Euclid, Algebra and, for those wishing higher grades, Newton's Principia), with a bit of appended Natural Science (mechanics, hydrostatics, astronomy and optics).  The third day was Moral Philosophy (principally an understanding of Locke's Essay and, later, a couple of Paley's texts), although this section was only added in 1779 and its scores did not really matter for the overall Tripos.  The fourth day saw the preliminary results, where students were grouped into six ordered categories, and a student in a lower category would be given a chance in the course of the day to challenge a higher student to a mathematical duel.  Finally, on the fifth day, the final results, the (in)famous Tripos list, would be published, rank ordering the students from the highest to the lowest.   At the start, the Tripos was wholly voluntary (the required final oral Latin disputation was not dropped until 1838).  But in the course of the 18th and 19th C., it became increasingly important and students competed fiercely for it.  As the Tripos was really the only 'objective' way of assessing the intellectual achievement of Cambridge students, a high score on the Tripos opened doors to better careers for many students of modest backgrounds. A high Tripos score practically guaranteed a Fellowship to a College, a requirement for anyone hoping for an academic career or high ecclesiastical position.  The annual Tripos list was published openly from 1748 to 1909, and usually made it to the national newspapers.  Of course, the already well-connected sons of the nobility and gentry, who regarded the university as merely a 'finishing school' for good manners and connections, did not bother with the Tripos, and a differentiation soon emerged between 'honours' students (those intending to attempt the Tripos) and 'pass' (or 'poll') students (those who didn't).  From 1753, an honours student that completed the Tripos examination with high marks ('first class honours') was known as a Wrangler, those with second-class honours  as Senior Optimes and the third class honours as Junior Optimes.   Wranglers were usually offered Fellowships at their Colleges.   The highest scoring student was known as the 'Senior Wrangler', the next as the 'Second Wrangler', and so on. William Paley (1763) and A.W. Flux (1887) achieved the top rank of Senior Wrangler.  Among Second Wranglers, we find William Whewell (1816), Leonard Courtney (1855), Alfred Marshall (1865) and George H. Darwin (1868).  Rev. Robert Malthus placed 9th (1768), while John Maynard Keynes placed 12th (1905).  Philippa Fawcett, daughter of Henry Fawcett, was unofficially the Senior Wrangler of 1890, and the first woman to top the list. As the harder and highest-scoring questions on the Tripos were in the mathematical section, honours students tended to focus almost exclusively on studying mathematics, to the exclusion of other subjects, during their time at Cambridge.  In an attempt to rectify this, the Moral Philosophy section was added to the Tripos in 1779, but because it did not really impact the scores, was not really studied for.  The dominance of the Tripos undermined the wider curriculum the colleges sought to teach - and indeed were required to teach.   But few students cared for anything outside the mathematics required for the Tripos.  Beginning with St. John's in the 1770s, individual colleges began instituting their own in-house written examinations in other subjects (Classics, Moral Philosophy, etc.), frequently for cash prizes, to encourage students to make an effort to study outside mathematics.   Indeed, Trinity College went so far as to make the results on its in-house examination (est. in 1790), rather than the Tripos, as the condition for its fellowships. A Classical Tripos was introduced in 1824, although it was required (until 1857) that a student must pass the Mathematical Tripos before attempting this (exceptions were given to noblemen).  Although there were no formal requirements for admission into a Cambridge college other than a headmaster's letter, the 'Previous Examination' was introduced in 1824, whereby all second-year students were required to pass a written examination, demonstrating their knowledge of one of the Gospels (in Greek), a Greek or Latin classic, Paley's Evidences of Christianity and the first three books of Euclid - something any public school education would have given them.  Candidates for honours degrees had additional requirements in mathematics in their Previous Examinations.  Poll students were supposed to sit a Final Examination in May, essentially a reiteration of the Previous Examination, with additional sections relating to the material from one of the compulsory courses taught by the dozen or so university professors.  Consequently, a professors' lectures tended to packed with unwilling poll students seeking to meet this requirement.  Honours students took their final Tripos Examination in January, on the different honors syllabus.   Despite these efforts, the mathematical character of the Tripos distorted the educational balance at Cambridge.  Students disinclined to that mathematical race, often preferred to enroll at logic-focused Oxford instead.   The type of mathematics itself was also twisted by the very structure of the examination scheme.  As so much was hanging on the precise ordering of the students, the examiners took to constructing very precise but abstruse questions, which would trip up many but could be objectively graded.  The mathematics also remained firmly confined to the Euclidian geometry and Newtonian world of yesteryear, with little or no infusion from developments in mathematics, particularly in algebra, from the Continent.   It is significant that despite Cambridge's focus, very few top-level British mathematicians taught at Cambridge. As a result, the press for reform of the Tripos came not merely from the rearguard of Classics and Humanities, but also from Mathematicians and Natural Scientists themselves, who did not feel that their subjects were being properly learned because of these examinations. Economics enters Cambridge The English lord Charles Townshend (3rd Viscount) persuaded Cambridge University to introduce a prize in 1754 for the best essay on an economic topic (""for the Study of the Theory of Trade"").  The prize was awarded in 1755, but discontinued in 1756, when Townshend himself objected to the question decided upon (on the relationship between commerce and population growth) as he had not been consulted.  The topic was briefly revived in the 1770s, when William Paley lectured at Cambridge.  Paley's lectures touched on some economic topics - what would subsequently be published (in 1785) as Paley's Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy. The earlier (non-economic) parts of Paley's Principles were subsequently introduced into examinations at Trinity College in 1786, and eventually became part of the Tripos examination well into the 19th C. After Paley left, in 1784, R.A. Ingram, a fellow of Queen's, submitted a plan for incorporating economics in the Cambridge curriculum, proposing a set of public lectures at the university, but that plan failed to generate interest.  William Smyth, who was Professor of Modern History at Cambridge from 1807, incorporated some economic subjects in that context. Paley was leaving just as the young Robert Malthus enrolled at Jesus College, Cambridge.  Although Malthus was elected fellow and maintained his contacts with Cambridge over the years, he was not sufficiently inspired to stick around, spending most of his time as a country pastor in Albury.  Malthus made a splash with his 1798 Essay on Population.  It owes next-to-nothing to his Cambridge period, and if anything, annoyed the clerics.  But it led to Malthus's appointment as England's first professor of political economy in 1805 - not, however, at Cambridge, but at the East India College in Haileybury. Malthus's population essay kicked off the revival of interest in economics in England.  It accelerated with the 1810 Bullionist controversy and the 1815 Corn Laws debate.  Political economy became the rage in social circles, the subject of discussion everywhere. Marcet's primers and popular lecturers brought the topic to common people. And it was the height of this that a young lawyer, George Pryme, proposed to bring economics to Cambridge in 1816. Cambridge University hired George Pryme as its first lecturer on political economy in 1816.  Although that is a slight overstatement - he was not paid by the university (Pryme collected his fees directly from students), and it was understood that Pryme's lectures would not interfere with the students' real studies.  And, as it turns out, it did not interfere too much.  Interest was strong at first, but Pryme was a dull lecturer and his coverage very elementary.  As the topic receded in public interest and attendance waned, Pryme's lectures were confined to alternate years. In 1825, Oxford University instituted the Drummond chair in political economy.   A similar plan had been hatched by William Huskisson for Cambridge, but only on the condition that it go to someone other than Pryme. But Pryme's administrative services to the university made him hard to exclude and the plan sunk.  Still, unwilling to be left behind by Oxford, the Cambridge senate nonetheless decided to formally create the title of ""Professor of Political Economy"" for George Pryme on May 27, 1828.  It was a mere title, with no additional responsibilities nor emoluments.   Whewell and Empirical-Inductivism Pryme was contemporary to the polymath William Whewell, a supernova in a Cambridge firmament crowded with stars. Dissatisfied with the archaic Cambridge curriculum, Whewell had drunk deeply from continental sources - notably French mathematical science and German philosophy.  Whewell  and his fellow-travelers - John F.W. Herschel, Charles Babbage, George Peacock and others - had launched the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1819, an effort to bring modern continental science to England.  Although he took the relatively humble chair of mineralogy in 1828, Whewell was a multi-faceted scholar and his influence stretched far beyond that. Whewell and the CPS group had opposed Pryme's appointment to the political economy chair. Whewell felt Pryme was a lightweight, that his economics were pass√©, that he was simply taking up valuable space, and even retarding the introduction of proper economics into Cambridge.  Sedgwick's famous Discourse on university education delivered in late 1832 included a plea for economics. Whewell had dabbled in economics himself, most notably Whewell was the first to attempt to translate economic theory into mathematical equations (1828-30).  But Whewell found the Ricardian theory contradictory and lacking.  Whewell's economics guru was  Richard Jones, a former Cantabrigian, now ensconced as a country pastor in Sussex, but still in constant contact with Cambridge.  A strong  proponent of the English empirical-inductivist tradition of Bacon, Jones detached Whewell from his Cartesian proclivities and pushed him in the empiricist direction, not only in economics, but in his entire scientific outlook.  The mission of economics, like in all science, they asserted, was not to rationally deduce complicated theories from thin axioms, but to establish firm premises drawn from evidence, observation and empirical facts. This was boldly proclaimed in Richard Jones's inaugural address as professor at KCL in 1832, and seconded by William , and Charles Babbage.  The empirical-inductivist approach to science in general finds its apotheosis in Whewell's monumental History (1837) and Philosophy of Science (1840). Richard Jones is often called the founding father (or grandfather) of the English Historical School.  One might even characterize the empiricist-inductivist school of Whewell, Jones and Babbage as the first ""Cambridge school"", competing with the logical-deductivist catallactic school at Oxford, and the theoretical Ricardian school in London for the soul of economics in 1830s Britain.  Indeed, it would not be too outlandish to expand this first Cambridge school to include Malthus, who had since developed a great interest in collecting data to supplement his population theory, and turned the population debate into an empirical question.  Malthus, Whewell, Jones and Babbage  were instrumental in the foundation of ""Section F"" (Statistics and Economics) of the British Association in 1833 and the Statistical Society of London in 1834.  Both of these institutions were dedicated to the empirical-inductivist approach, in contrast to the Ricardian-dominated Political Economy Club. The 1834 tests debate At its root, Cambridge University was an ecclesiastical institution, a seminary for the training of clerics for the Church of England.  But Cambridge had always been a little more relaxed about its religious requirements than the more conservative Oxford.  While Oxford required religious tests both at matriculation and to receive a degree, and examined the student carefully for knowledge of the 39 Articles of the Anglican faith, Cambridge dispensed with the matriculation test altogether and only required that a student declare he was a bona fide member of the Church of England to get his degree [following the Cambridge senate resolution, or grace, of June 23, 1772 (txt)].  This allowed Dissenters (non-Anglicans) to enroll at Cambridge and attend classes, even if they could not ultimately graduate with a degree.  As a result, in the course of the centuries, while Oxford maintained itself as the ultimate citadel of orthodox ""High Church"" Anglicanism, Cambridge acquired a reputation as a breeder of Non-Conformists, Puritans, ""Low Church"" enthusiasm and other heterodox strains of religious opinion.  Students may be required to attend college chapel, and occasionally listen to tiresome lectures by Cambridge divines, but otherwise were left to themselves. On March 21, 1834, a group of sixty-two Cambridge residents petitioned the British parliament for the abolition of religion tests for degrees.  The petition was signed by a bevy of senior professors and other notables, including scientists and mathematicians like G.B. Airy, Adam Sedgwick, William Farish, George Peacock and Charles Babbage.  They pointed out that talented Dissenter students found their future professional careers as lawyers, doctors, teachers, etc. severely hampered by lack of a degree. The petition was presented before parliament by the Whig PM Earl Grey. The rest of the Cambridge community balked and immediately arranged a counter-petition, much larger than the original, expressing a desire to maintain the religious tests.  Nonetheless, a bill for removing the religious tests to receiving degrees was soon drafted and introduced.   It was vigorously supported in parliament by  Henry Brougham (then lord chancellor) and George Pryme (then a Cambridge MP).  The debate raged through 1834, in a cascade of pamphlets and articles.  Proponents pointed out it was a minor change,  limited to the BA degrees, a parting gift to graduates on their way out, men who were leaving Cambridge anyway, and would not affect the Anglican character of the university itself in any manner.  But opponents of the bill feared it was the thin end of the wedge, that if passed, then the pressure would be irresistible to remove other religious clauses - to fellowships and scholarships in colleges, say, or to the MA degrees, and consequently university bodies.  A Cambridge governed by multi-denominational councils would lose its fundamental connection with the Church of England. The quarrel soon escalated. Thomas Turton, Dean of Peterborough and the Regius professor of Divinity, deplored the laxity that allowed Dissenters to attend classes at Cambridge to begin with.  A young Trinity tutor Connop Thirlwall offered the reply, partly in jest, that Dissenters did not mind, given that there was so little religious instruction going on at Cambridge anyway, it hardly made any difference. Thirlwall then went on to propose dropping mandatory chapel as well.  Thirlwall's  pamphlet offended the traditionalists, and he was promptly pressed to resign.  The dismissal of Thirlwall quickly became a cause celebre, and many who were originally critical (such as William Whewell), flipped over to the liberal side.   The bill eventually passed the House of Commons, but was thrown out in Lords.  Despite the illustrious names backing it, they were few and too young to be influential, and the conservative forces of both Cambridge and Oxford combined to defeat it. The timing was maybe not perfect, coming on the tail-end of a dizzying sequence of other liberalizing measures that had shocked conservatives - the removal of civil religious tests in 1828, Catholic emancipation in 1829, the parliamentary reform in 1832, Irish church reform in 1833, etc.  By 1834, traditionalists, including the cleric-dominated universities, felt the Anglican church was being besieged, making them adamant about holding the line somewhere, and hyper-vigilant to any further changes.  The 1834 tests debate produced some reactionary blowback - accelerating the ultra-conservative  ""Tractarian"" movement  at Oxford.  However, Cambridge did not experience anything of that kind. The Moral Sciences Tripos William Whewell was elected master of Trinity College in 1841. From this new powerful perch, Whewell finally had the chance to implement his program of modernizing education at Cambridge.    By this time, the push for educational reform was not merely the foreign fantasy of some lone master or philosophical society.  The modern-oriented University College London was up and running, showing how it could be done, and attracting many students.  The needs of growing British industry and the domestic and imperial civil service favored better-prepared graduates.  Unreformed, Cambridge was in danger of losing its inside track to appointments and positions, and shriveling into irrelevance. Whewell was the critical force behind the introduction of the ""Natural Sciences"" and ""Moral Sciences"" tripos examinations in 1848 (a plan for Theological Tripos conjured at the same time was shelved.).  The Moral Sciences Tripos had a difficult birthing history.  In its original 1848 conception, the Moral Sciences Tripos covered Moral Philosophy, Political Economy, Modern History, General Jurisprudence and the Laws of England, a hodge-podge of only faintly related topics.  It may seem that with the Mathematical, Classical and Natural Sciences Triposes in place by 1848, the Moral Sciences Tripos was just an afterthought, a way to just sweep the remaining fields taught by university professors into a single examination (the five topics were examined by the corresponding five professors).  But it can also been argued that Whewell, who was the Knightsbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy since 1838, and chief of the Moral Sciences Tripos, actually believed there was a natural way to weave law, history and economics together, under the grand umbrella of ""natural theology"".  Whatever Whewell's vision may have been, it did not turn out that way.  While economics was on the curriculum, there was little incentive to study it, since in its early years, the Moral Sciences examination consisted primarily of questions about facts of modern history and legal history.  The Moral Sciences Tripos did not attract many students - it did not lead to a B.A. degree (which still had to go through Mathematics or Classics), and its honours were denigrated as the questions called on rote memory rather than skill. With the paucity of students attempting it, the colleges didn't bother to set up lectureships in it. 1856 Reform During the 1834 tests debate, traditionalists at Cambridge had successfully defended religious restrictions by pointing out they were bound by oath to uphold the Elizabethan statutes and the terms of the wills of the founders of the colleges and scholarships.  In the aftermath of their defeat, the proponents of liberalization began examining the statutes themselves in detail. They were 'shocked' to discover that the extensive educational curriculum and requirements mandated in the statutes were quite at variance with practice in the university and colleges.  While it may seem odd in retrospect, the 'discovery' that Cambridge was intended to be an educational institution, rather than an ecclesiastical institution, was something of a novelty.  It gave the liberalizers their opening to argue that parliamentary interference in the internal workings of the university was legally, morally and politically justified.  As the universities were national educational institutions and not private seminaries of the Church of England, parliamentary legislation modifying the statutes would not be 'breaching' some barrier between State and Church.  In their push to reform the statutes, the liberalizers found natural allies in the educational reformers. In April 1850, fifteen years after the tests debate, Sir James Heywood, an MP and Unitarian who had studied (but not taken a degree) at Cambridge, introduced a motion in parliament for a review of the university and college statutes.   The Whig PM Lord John Russell took this in hand and appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the state of Cambridge University.  Parallel commissions were established for Oxford and Dublin.  The Cambridge Commission of five were all Cantabrigians.  It was chaired by John Graham (Bishop of Chester) and included three scientists of reforming bent - mathematician George Peacock, astronomer Sir John Herschel and geology professor Adam Sedgwick [list]  While there was resistance to the royal inquiry by Cambridge university authorities and colleges, it did not reach the same dramatic pitch as the resistance at arch-conservative Oxford.  The subsequent Cambridge Commission report, which was officially delivered on August 30, 1852, was not nearly as harsh either, but in some ways also less radical. Cambridge was commended for the reforms it had already undertaken, and the commission did not recommend changing the celibacy requirement for fellowships, nor removing the existing religious tests for a BA degree (other than extending that same simple bona fide test to other bachelor degrees, like the B.C.L. and  B.M.).  They nonetheless made a general note, that other civil institutions have removed religious barriers and granted equal rights, and that it would be a noble thing if Cambridge kept ""pace with the progress of  enlightened opinion"" and move ""in sympathy and unison with the spirit of the age"", and not  ""estrange itself from the great movement of liberal progress"" (p.44). Parliament tackled Oxford first, and with some difficulty, passed the Oxford reform act in 1854.  It was only two years later that the separate Cambridge reform bill was submitted by Edward Bouverie on May 30, 1846 [Hansard], and passed more easily,  receiving royal assent on July 29, 1856 (19 & 20 Vict. c.88).   Like at Oxford, the Cambridge was to be saddled with a temporary royal Executive Commission  (¬ß1) to oversee the implementation of the reforms.  Cambridge colleges would be given the chance to alter their college statutes themselves (¬ß27), and only if they failed to do so, would the Executive Commission step in and legislate for them (¬ß29) (similarly for the University statutes  (¬ß30-31)) . The act established a Council of the Senate  (¬ß5), composed of 18 persons, including members of the professoriat  (¬ß6).  Secret oaths or conspiracies to resist changes are declared illegal (¬ß22).  The opening of private hostels was permitted (¬ß23-¬ß26).   The act abolished religious tests for all bachelor degrees (except divinity) (¬ß45) - indeed the original motion passed in Commons included the abolition of religious tests for MA degrees (thus allowing Dissenters to sit on government bodies), but the MA restrictions were restored by the House of Lords in the final act.  The act also removed religious restrictions on exhibitions and scholarships (¬ß46).  Unlike the Oxford Act, the Cambridge Act does not contain any clause pertaining to mandatory chapel. The 1856 reform opened Cambridge University to students of Dissenting religions. But the continued religious restriction on MAs, and certain college fellowships and other emoluments,  meant they were still barred from becoming Cambridge fellows, professors and readers.  This barrier to finally removed in 1871, with the elimination of all remaining religious tests.   The celibacy requirement for fellowships was retained until 1882.. Professorship The Moral Sciences Tripos was overhauled by John Grote, who succeeded Whewell in the moral philosophy chair in 1855. In 1860, the Moral Sciences Tripos finally became an honours course for a B.A. degree and a Moral Sciences Board established.  General jurisprudence remained on the Moral Sciences curriculum for a while, although Laws of England was removed to a separate ""Law Tripos"" (for an LL.B. degree) that had been established in 1858.  In its place, Logic and Mental Philosophy (i.e. psychology) was introduced.  Nearly a decade later, in 1867,  Jurisprudence and Modern History (which continued to engulf the examination) was finally removed from the Moral Sciences tripos, and Political Philosophy introduced in its place. (History was initially transferred to Law, becoming ""Law and History"" Tripos in 1870, but it was an unhappy arrangement; they were separated with the formation of the History tripos in 1873).  So with Law and History finally expurged, the Moral Sciences Tripos examination was freed of their dominance. It was really only then that Moral Sciences was given room to develop, and students finally given reason to study economics.  In sum, by 1870, the Moral Sciences Tripos was defined as Moral and Political Philosophy, Mental Philosophy and Logic and Political Economy. The Professorship in Political Economy was only made permanent by the university senate in October, 1863.   The holder was to be paid ¬£300 annually, plus a share of student fees.  The professor would have to stay in residence at Cambridge for at least eighteen weeks per year, and give lectures.  To facilitate its passage, the long-time holder George Pryme resigned the chair.  Contests were immediately opened in November 1863, and four candidates proposed: J.B. Mayor (a lecturer in moral sciences and fellow of St. John's), Leonard Courtney (former professor of political economy at UCL, and also a fellow of St. John's), Henry Dunning Macleod (banker) and Henry Fawcett (fellow of Trinity Hall).  Fawcett had recently published his Manual of Political Economy, which was well-received, and was armed with recommendation from prominent economists (e.g. John Stuart Mill, W.T.Thornton, William Newmarch, Herman Merivale, J.E. Thorold  Rogers among others). Choice of the Professor was by ballot, with the electors consisting of all M.A.s who had maintained residency at Cambridge.  Fawcett won easily.  Fawcett would give an annual course of lectures on political economy at Cambridge for the next twenty years, until his death in 1884. The Cambridge Professor of Political Economy would be on the board of both the Moral Sciences Tripos and the History Tripos, and thus economics classes had honours students attempting either of those examinations.  But it was still a weak course.   The economics textbooks required by Pryme in 1860 (bk) for the examination were thoroughly Classical: Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, Malthus's Essay, Ricardo's Principles, J.S. Mill's Principles, McCulloch's Political Economy, Richard Jones's Rent, Carey's Political Economy and Chevalier's Cours.  Fawcett slimmed it down in 1867 (bk) to Smith, Ricardo and Mill, plus Cairnes's Character and Bastiat's Harmonies. Fawcett's own Manual was used for the special examination for ordinary (poll) degrees. As Mary Paley later recalled, in 1870, the Moral Sciences Tripos had a reputation as ""the course for girls"", as it required neither mathematics nor classics.  But the reputation of Moral Sciences began to ascend with several notable honours candidates in the early 1870s. Local examinations and extension lectures The drive for reforming universities, was followed up by a more general drive for improving all education in Britain. Movements, like the National Education League, pushed for the introduction of general, non-sectarian public schools, reaching its climax in Forster's 1870 Education Act.  The universities were caught up in the fever for expanding education to the general public.  In 1873, Cambridge launched the ""Cambridge Extension"" lectures,. to bring academic fare to adult students outside the university. Foxwell and Cunningham were early extension lecturers on economics.  The idea for university extension lectures was reputedly begun by James Stuart, a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Asked in the Fall of 1867 to lecture on the art of teaching to an audience of school-teachers, Stuart decided to demonstrate it instead, and went on to give a series of lectures on astronomy to various audiences of teachers and artisans in Leeds, Sheffield, Manchester and Liverpool. While public lectures had been routinely sponsored by mechanics institutes and literary societies, Stuart introduced several innovations - courses of multiple lectures (rather than single lectures), syllabi for note-taking, and written examinations by correspondence.  Stuart persuaded some other Cambridge friends to follow his lead in subsequent years, but there was little incentive.  The extension lecturers tried to set themselves up a peripatetic university, hoping to tap into workers' cooperatives for organization and funding, but this proved difficult..  So in 1871, Stuart proposed that Cambridge University incorporate the extension lecturers as an integral part of the university.  A trial period was undertaken, and three fellows of Trinity promptly set out north to the provincial cities of Nottingham, Derby and Leicester, to deliver courses on economics, mechanics and English literature.  The prescribed rules were that an extension course consisted of (1) twelve weekly lectures,  (2) printed syllabi, (3) weekly written exercises, (4) a tutorial class in connection with each lecture; (5) written examinations at the end of the course, overseen by examiners appointed by the syndicate, and the provision of a certificate of completion..  Goschen proposed the adoption of the extension system to London in 1875, and it was accepted and launched in 1876.  Benjamin Jowett pressed the plan on Oxford, and it launched its own university extension syndicate in 1878. It had trouble getting started, and was virtually abandoned a couple of years later.  But in 1885 Oxford revived the extension system by providing for six-lecture courses (cheaper to fund than the original twelve-lecture scheme), and the extension lectures moved onto explosive growth.  Oxford also had lecturers be accompanied by a traveling library, ensuring students had access to the readings in the syllabi, and began bringing in select extension pupils in to Oxford for more intensive summer teaching. 1882 Statutes New statutes for Cambridge University were introduced in 1877, and came into law in 1882.  In the reorganization, there would be a Moral Science board consisting of three professors: Political Economy (Fawcett), Moral Philosophy (T.R. Birks) and Mental Philosophy and Logic (vacant at the time).  In 1883, the utilitarian philosopher Henry Sidgwick succeeded Birks to the Knightsbridge chair of Moral Philosophy.  The third chair (Mental Philosophy) was only filled with the appointment of James Ward in 1897.  By the new statutes, the stipends for the professors were increased to ¬£700 (minus ¬£200 if he also held a separate fellowship at a college).  Professors were required to give annual lecture series and expected to undertake ""research and the advancement of knowledge in the department"".  The fulfillment of these requirements would be overseen by the Moral Sciences Board.   The economics curriculum changed dramatically over time.  The Moral Sciences board (Fawcett & Sidgwick's) 1883-84 reading list still placed Mill's Principles as centerpiece, but included content from more Historicist (Roscher, Cunninhgam, Cliffe-Leslie), Financial (Bagehot, Goschen) and Neoclassical (Walker, Cournot, Jevons and Marshall) literature.  For the economics section of the History Tripos, there were additional readings from Levi, Brentano and Thorold Rogers. Marshall and the Economics Tripos [see also Cambridge Neoclassicals] Fawcett died in November 1884, and a new competition for the Professorship of Political Economy began - which, under the new statutes, were to be chosen by a select committee of nine rather than elected by the much wider body of resident MAs.  There were six candidates in the running - four of them considerably strong and equally matched:  H.D. Macleod  (again),  R.H. Inglis Palgrave (another banker), William Cunningham (a rising economic historian) and Alfred Marshall (then teaching at Oxford). In the end, Alfred Marshall was elected.  At the time, Marshall was still a relative unknown, having few publications compared to the others; but he had a solid reputation as a long-time lecturer (whereas it was a question mark with the others), and close friendships with some of the electors (notably Herbert S. Foxwell),  Marshall gave his inaugural lecture as professor at Cambridge on February 24, 1885.  Almost from the outset, Marshall set about trying to expand the proportion of economics in both the Moral Sciences and History curriculum and exams.  For this, there were titanic struggles behind the scenes in Cambridge.  Marshall's scheme of aggrandizement naturally came up against the resistance of the other two members of the Moral Sciences Board - Henry Sidgwick (Moral Philosophy) and, later, James Ward (Mental Philosophy).  Moreover, Marshall's narrowly Neoclassical vision of what constituted :""economics"" also annoyed natural allies, like the historicist lecturer William Cunninhgam.  But in his endeavor, Marshall had the support of some lecturers. notably Herbert Foxwell and John Neville Keynes.  Eventually, through negotiation, Marshall and Sidgwick gradually agreed on the increasing separation of the philosophical from the economic parts of the Moral Sciences curriculum, effectively accomplished in 1897, allowing students to specialize in one or the other. After Sidgwick's death in 1900, Marshall pressed for a permanent secession, pointing at the example of the LSE (f.1895) as showing the direction Cambridge needed to go.  He finally won his case, and the ""Economics Tripos"" (in full ""Economics and Associated Branches in Political Economy"") was introduced in 1903.  The supervisory Economics Board included the Professor of Political Economy (Marshall), but also the new professor of Moral Philosophy (W.R. Sorley), Modern History (J.R. Bury), Laws of England (Maitland),  International Law (J. Westlake) and Geography (H.Y. Oldham).  A.W. Ward (Master of Peterhouse) was the first chairman of the Economics Board and political scientist Lowes Dickinson was its first secretary.  Marshall still hoped for some overlap - that is, Marshall expected that students in Moral Sciences Tripos would still be required to learn economics in Part I of their degree program, and if they had a taste for it, could transfer over to Economics Tripos for Part II.  But this was denied him - economics was expunged entirely from the Moral Sciences curriculum, and the professor of political economy removed from the Moral Sciences Board. In 1903, the London livery company of Girdlers endowed a lectureship in economics at Cambridge, with an emolument of ¬£100 per annum, to begin in 1904 and run for three years.  Marshall student Arthur Cecil Pigou (who had obtained his degree in 1900) was appointed the first Girdlers' University Lecturer.  The Girdlers renewed their endowment in 1907. In the early years of the new Economics Tripos, there were only three paid instructors dedicated to economics - Marshall as professor, Foxwell as St. John's lecturer and Pigou as Girdlers' lecturer (Neville Keynes, now deep into logic, remained with Moral Sciences).  Other teachers were drawn from other triposes  (e.g. H.D. MacGregor and William Cunningham from history).  Marshall succeeded Ward as chairman of the Economics Board in 1906, and began to prepare his own retirement from the economics professorship.  The succession to Marshall's professorial chair in 1908 was marked by controversy.  The chair had long been promised by Marshall to his former pupil Herbert S. Foxwell, who had reluctantly accepted the chair at UCL back in 1881 (albeit retaining his St John lectureship), on the promise that he would succeed Marshall at Cambridge.  But by the mid-1900s, it was clear Marshall's preferences had changed definitively in favor of Arthur Cecil Pigou.  Marshall placed heavy pressure on on the electors - A.J. Balfour,  Leonard Courtney, F.Y. Edgeworth, J.N. Keynes, J.S. Nicholson, R.H. Inglis Palgrave, V.H. Stanton and W.R. Sorley - and Pigou was elected Professor of Political Economy in 1908.  Later that year, when former Foxwell student, Henry Higgs, proposed to raise money for a second economics chair at Cambridge specifically for Foxwell, Marshall sunk the proposal, openly declaring Foxwell unfit.  To this injury was added insult in 1916, when Pigou petitioned for exemption from military service in World War I, on account that there was ""no one"" at Cambridge able to replace him (Foxwell was still lecturing there).  Pigou years To take up the professorship in June 1908, Arthur Cecil Pigou resigned the Girdlers' lectureship to economic historian H.O. Meredith. At the same time, to make up for Foxwell's departure, the Economics and Politics Board authorized two new lectureships in economics (with a modest stipend of ¬£100 each, paid out of Pigou's professorship).  These were awarded to Walter Thomas Layton (a recent Trinity graduate) and the young John Maynard Keynes (graduated from King's in 1906, Keynes had been since cooling his heels at the India Office in London, waiting for a chance to return).   Meredith would resign in 1911, to take up a post in Queen's College Belfast, and so Keynes moved up to Girdlers lecturer in 1911.  Simultaneously, the second lectureship, held by Layton, was upgraded (made official, with the funds now coming from the general university fund rather than Pigou's pocket).  Rounding off the teaching of economics in this period were the mathematician and moral sciences lecturer W.E. Johnson, tthe economic historians John Clapham and C.R. Fay, and the political scientist Lowes Dickinson. There is little doubt that Pigou and Keynes were the dominant figures at Cambridge, the heirs of Marshall and Foxwell.  In October 1909, Keynes launched the ""Political Economy Club"" at Cambridge, an exclusive discussion club that met on Monday evenings, consisting mostly of faculty (although Pigou rarely attended), graduate students and some bright undergraduates.. Among the new economics students bred during this time by Pigou and Keynes were Dennis H. Robertson (Trinity), Hubert D. Henderson and Frederick Lavington (Emmanuel), Gerald Shove and Hugh Dalton (King's College) and Dudley Ward (St. John's).  The atmosphere was also changing at this time, with the arrival of the Fabian Socialists in 1906, with their open membership and politically fashionable radical ideas.  The Fabians soon became the center of intellectual and social life at Cambridge, gradually eclipsing the older and more detached ""Apostles"". The First World War decimated Cambridge.  Legions of its students had abandoned their studies to enlist, many of them going on to be slaughtered in the trenches of the western front.  Keynes had been seconded to the Treasury, while Pigou lectured to nearly empty classrooms.. With the loss of a generation, its adjustment to the post-war situation were difficult. In the lectureships, Layton would be succeeded by Hubert D. Henderson in 1919 and Keynes by Frederick Lavington  in 1920.  In the early 1920s, this included, besides Pigou and Keynes, Gerald Shove (King's College), Dennis H. Robertson and Frank P. Ramsey (Trinity),  Austin Robinson (Corpus Christi), Frederick Lavington (Emmanuel), and Maurice H. Dobb ( (Clare).  Joan Maurice/Robinson (Girton) was excluded. The Department of Applied Economics was created in 1945, with director Richard Stone.  It merged with the Faculty of Economics in 2004.      Professors of Political Economy 1816 George Pryme

Cambridge," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by Cambridge University, nor its constituent colleges nor any other organization. See the official Cambridge University website] The University of Cambridge, alongside its great rival Oxford, is one of the ancient universities of England.  In the course of its history, the economics faculty at Cambridge has been arguably the single most influential faculty in the development of economics in the 20th Century. Structure Cambridge is a collegiate university, composed of 31 colleges, half of which have been founded since the 1880s.  The oldest extant college is Peterhouse (or St. Peter's College) which was founded in 1284 by the Bishop of Ely.  The largest and arguably most famous of its colleges is Trinity College (f.  1546 by Henry VIII), which nurtured Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton and other leading lights of the scientific revolution of the 17th C.  The powerful mathematics tradition at Trinity produced a second scientific revolution in the 19th C. under the leadership of William Whewell, which included Charles Babbage, Augustus de Morgan, Francis Galton, Arthur Cayley, James Clerk Maxwell and others.  Towards the end of the century, Trinity was also the home of the philosophers Alfred North Whitehead, Bertrand Russell, G.E. Moore and Henry Sidgwick.   But historians of economics are usually drawn to Trinity's great rival, King's College (f.1441 by Henry VI), the home of Arthur Cecil Pigou and John Maynard Keynes and crucible of the Keynesian revolution, and the post-Keynesian 'Cambridge School' of economics of  Richard F. Kahn, Nicholas Kaldor, Joan Robinson. Although Cambridge traditionally hosted a number of ""university professors"", usually one for each field, by and large, the job of educating the students was left to the constituent colleges, the central university merely providing the final examination and bestowing the degrees.  Each college had a stable of 'fellows' who acted as tutors and lecturers for the students. In principle, fellows were recent graduates that continued residing at the college to 'mentor' undergraduate. By statute, the fellows of a college were expected to be ordained into the Anglican priesthood after seven years.  However, a fellow who took up lecturing could retain the fellowship without ordination (although, until 1882, he was still required to remain unmarried.)   A fellowship was originally designed for only a few years for a small emolument, but its length increased greatly over time and better paid, becoming a quite comfortable career-long option.  To encourage resignations of fellows and open up spaces for 'new blood', colleges introduced a number of well-paid 'livings' (effectively, retirement pensions) available, competition for which was also quite stiff.  History Cambridge University was legendarily founded in 1209 by exiled scholars from Oxford. Cambridge was in full operation probably by 1229, and formally granted a royal charter by Edward I in 1291.  Its status as a Studium generale was confirmed by papal bull in 1318. Like monasteries and other church-related institutions, Cambridge was in danger of being seized during the Protestant reformation of Henry VIII in the 1530s. But the king decided to reform the university instead.  Endowments were overhauled and colleges were consolidated (famously King's Hall and Michaelhouse were merged to create Trinity College in 1546).  In 1540, Henry VIII had the crown create (and control) five professorial chairs, the 'Regius Professors' of Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Law and Medicine. (a crown chair in Divinity had already been endowed back in 1502). During the Henrican reforms, the traditional Catholic Scholastic curriculum was purged in favor of a more Humanistic one, marking the break with the Medieval  university.   Edward VI's Chantries Act of 1547, seizing revenues of church schools, specifically exempted Cambridge and Oxford.       Under Elizabeth I, Parliament passed the Act of Incorporation (1571), establishing the structure of Cambridge University, recasting it as a seminary for the Church of England and regulating the relationship between the central university and the constituent colleges.  The Elizabethan statutes were very detailed, down to curriculum and student life, and would remain unchanged until the 1856 Reform. The Tripos Through much of its history, Cambridge University was geared towards training clergy, and dominated by a Scholastic curriculum. By the Elizabethan statutes of the university, students were required in their first year to learn rhetoric, their second and third logic, and their fourth philosophy. Students obtained their undergraduate degrees after an oral examination, a Latin disputation to assess their language skills and mastery of Scholastic logic. In the course of the 17th C., the encroachment of vernacular teaching and the scientific revolution began whittling away at the importance of the disputation.  Around the 1730s, the newly-founded Senate House at Cambridge introduced the first  written examinations to students who had already met the statute requirements for graduation.  These Senate House examinations would become better known as the famous Tripos, a multi-day written examination ordeal in vernacular English.  The first two days of the Tripos were dedicated to Mathematics (Euclid, Algebra and, for those wishing higher grades, Newton's Principia), with a bit of appended Natural Science (mechanics, hydrostatics, astronomy and optics).  The third day was Moral Philosophy (principally an understanding of Locke's Essay and, later, a couple of Paley's texts), although this section was only added in 1779 and its scores did not really matter for the overall Tripos.  The fourth day saw the preliminary results, where students were grouped into six ordered categories, and a student in a lower category would be given a chance in the course of the day to challenge a higher student to a mathematical duel.  Finally, on the fifth day, the final results, the (in)famous Tripos list, would be published, rank ordering the students from the highest to the lowest.   At the start, the Tripos was wholly voluntary (the required final oral Latin disputation was not dropped until 1838).  But in the course of the 18th and 19th C., it became increasingly important and students competed fiercely for it.  As the Tripos was really the only 'objective' way of assessing the intellectual achievement of Cambridge students, a high score on the Tripos opened doors to better careers for many students of modest backgrounds. A high Tripos score practically guaranteed a Fellowship to a College, a requirement for anyone hoping for an academic career or high ecclesiastical position.  The annual Tripos list was published openly from 1748 to 1909, and usually made it to the national newspapers.  Of course, the already well-connected sons of the nobility and gentry, who regarded the university as merely a 'finishing school' for good manners and connections, did not bother with the Tripos, and a differentiation soon emerged between 'honours' students (those intending to attempt the Tripos) and 'pass' (or 'poll') students (those who didn't).  From 1753, an honours student that completed the Tripos examination with high marks ('first class honours') was known as a Wrangler, those with second-class honours  as Senior Optimes and the third class honours as Junior Optimes.   Wranglers were usually offered Fellowships at their Colleges.   The highest scoring student was known as the 'Senior Wrangler', the next as the 'Second Wrangler', and so on. William Paley (1763) and A.W. Flux (1887) achieved the top rank of Senior Wrangler.  Among Second Wranglers, we find William Whewell (1816), Leonard Courtney (1855), Alfred Marshall (1865) and George H. Darwin (1868).  Rev. Robert Malthus placed 9th (1768), while John Maynard Keynes placed 12th (1905).  Philippa Fawcett, daughter of Henry Fawcett, was unofficially the Senior Wrangler of 1890, and the first woman to top the list. As the harder and highest-scoring questions on the Tripos were in the mathematical section, honours students tended to focus almost exclusively on studying mathematics, to the exclusion of other subjects, during their time at Cambridge.  In an attempt to rectify this, the Moral Philosophy section was added to the Tripos in 1779, but because it did not really impact the scores, was not really studied for.  The dominance of the Tripos undermined the wider curriculum the colleges sought to teach - and indeed were required to teach.   But few students cared for anything outside the mathematics required for the Tripos.  Beginning with St. John's in the 1770s, individual colleges began instituting their own in-house written examinations in other subjects (Classics, Moral Philosophy, etc.), frequently for cash prizes, to encourage students to make an effort to study outside mathematics.   Indeed, Trinity College went so far as to make the results on its in-house examination (est. in 1790), rather than the Tripos, as the condition for its fellowships. A Classical Tripos was introduced in 1824, although it was required (until 1857) that a student must pass the Mathematical Tripos before attempting this (exceptions were given to noblemen).  Although there were no formal requirements for admission into a Cambridge college other than a headmaster's letter, the 'Previous Examination' was introduced in 1824, whereby all second-year students were required to pass a written examination, demonstrating their knowledge of one of the Gospels (in Greek), a Greek or Latin classic, Paley's Evidences of Christianity and the first three books of Euclid - something any public school education would have given them.  Candidates for honours degrees had additional requirements in mathematics in their Previous Examinations.  Poll students were supposed to sit a Final Examination in May, essentially a reiteration of the Previous Examination, with additional sections relating to the material from one of the compulsory courses taught by the dozen or so university professors.  Consequently, a professors' lectures tended to packed with unwilling poll students seeking to meet this requirement.  Honours students took their final Tripos Examination in January, on the different honors syllabus.   Despite these efforts, the mathematical character of the Tripos distorted the educational balance at Cambridge.  Students disinclined to that mathematical race, often preferred to enroll at logic-focused Oxford instead.   The type of mathematics itself was also twisted by the very structure of the examination scheme.  As so much was hanging on the precise ordering of the students, the examiners took to constructing very precise but abstruse questions, which would trip up many but could be objectively graded.  The mathematics also remained firmly confined to the Euclidian geometry and Newtonian world of yesteryear, with little or no infusion from developments in mathematics, particularly in algebra, from the Continent.   It is significant that despite Cambridge's focus, very few top-level British mathematicians taught at Cambridge. As a result, the press for reform of the Tripos came not merely from the rearguard of Classics and Humanities, but also from Mathematicians and Natural Scientists themselves, who did not feel that their subjects were being properly learned because of these examinations. Economics enters Cambridge The English lord Charles Townshend (3rd Viscount) persuaded Cambridge University to introduce a prize in 1754 for the best essay on an economic topic (""for the Study of the Theory of Trade"").  The prize was awarded in 1755, but discontinued in 1756, when Townshend himself objected to the question decided upon (on the relationship between commerce and population growth) as he had not been consulted.  The topic was briefly revived in the 1770s, when William Paley lectured at Cambridge.  Paley's lectures touched on some economic topics - what would subsequently be published (in 1785) as Paley's Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy. The earlier (non-economic) parts of Paley's Principles were subsequently introduced into examinations at Trinity College in 1786, and eventually became part of the Tripos examination well into the 19th C. After Paley left, in 1784, R.A. Ingram, a fellow of Queen's, submitted a plan for incorporating economics in the Cambridge curriculum, proposing a set of public lectures at the university, but that plan failed to generate interest.  William Smyth, who was Professor of Modern History at Cambridge from 1807, incorporated some economic subjects in that context. Paley was leaving just as the young Robert Malthus enrolled at Jesus College, Cambridge.  Although Malthus was elected fellow and maintained his contacts with Cambridge over the years, he was not sufficiently inspired to stick around, spending most of his time as a country pastor in Albury.  Malthus made a splash with his 1798 Essay on Population.  It owes next-to-nothing to his Cambridge period, and if anything, annoyed the clerics.  But it led to Malthus's appointment as England's first professor of political economy in 1805 - not, however, at Cambridge, but at the East India College in Haileybury. Malthus's population essay kicked off the revival of interest in economics in England.  It accelerated with the 1810 Bullionist controversy and the 1815 Corn Laws debate.  Political economy became the rage in social circles, the subject of discussion everywhere. Marcet's primers and popular lecturers brought the topic to common people. And it was the height of this that a young lawyer, George Pryme, proposed to bring economics to Cambridge in 1816. Cambridge University hired George Pryme as its first lecturer on political economy in 1816.  Although that is a slight overstatement - he was not paid by the university (Pryme collected his fees directly from students), and it was understood that Pryme's lectures would not interfere with the students' real studies.  And, as it turns out, it did not interfere too much.  Interest was strong at first, but Pryme was a dull lecturer and his coverage very elementary.  As the topic receded in public interest and attendance waned, Pryme's lectures were confined to alternate years. In 1825, Oxford University instituted the Drummond chair in political economy.   A similar plan had been hatched by William Huskisson for Cambridge, but only on the condition that it go to someone other than Pryme. But Pryme's administrative services to the university made him hard to exclude and the plan sunk.  Still, unwilling to be left behind by Oxford, the Cambridge senate nonetheless decided to formally create the title of ""Professor of Political Economy"" for George Pryme on May 27, 1828.  It was a mere title, with no additional responsibilities nor emoluments.   Whewell and Empirical-Inductivism Pryme was contemporary to the polymath William Whewell, a supernova in a Cambridge firmament crowded with stars. Dissatisfied with the archaic Cambridge curriculum, Whewell had drunk deeply from continental sources - notably French mathematical science and German philosophy.  Whewell  and his fellow-travelers - John F.W. Herschel, Charles Babbage, George Peacock and others - had launched the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1819, an effort to bring modern continental science to England.  Although he took the relatively humble chair of mineralogy in 1828, Whewell was a multi-faceted scholar and his influence stretched far beyond that. Whewell and the CPS group had opposed Pryme's appointment to the political economy chair. Whewell felt Pryme was a lightweight, that his economics were pass√©, that he was simply taking up valuable space, and even retarding the introduction of proper economics into Cambridge.  Sedgwick's famous Discourse on university education delivered in late 1832 included a plea for economics. Whewell had dabbled in economics himself, most notably Whewell was the first to attempt to translate economic theory into mathematical equations (1828-30).  But Whewell found the Ricardian theory contradictory and lacking.  Whewell's economics guru was  Richard Jones, a former Cantabrigian, now ensconced as a country pastor in Sussex, but still in constant contact with Cambridge.  A strong  proponent of the English empirical-inductivist tradition of Bacon, Jones detached Whewell from his Cartesian proclivities and pushed him in the empiricist direction, not only in economics, but in his entire scientific outlook.  The mission of economics, like in all science, they asserted, was not to rationally deduce complicated theories from thin axioms, but to establish firm premises drawn from evidence, observation and empirical facts. This was boldly proclaimed in Richard Jones's inaugural address as professor at KCL in 1832, and seconded by William , and Charles Babbage.  The empirical-inductivist approach to science in general finds its apotheosis in Whewell's monumental History (1837) and Philosophy of Science (1840). Richard Jones is often called the founding father (or grandfather) of the English Historical School.  One might even characterize the empiricist-inductivist school of Whewell, Jones and Babbage as the first ""Cambridge school"", competing with the logical-deductivist catallactic school at Oxford, and the theoretical Ricardian school in London for the soul of economics in 1830s Britain.  Indeed, it would not be too outlandish to expand this first Cambridge school to include Malthus, who had since developed a great interest in collecting data to supplement his population theory, and turned the population debate into an empirical question.  Malthus, Whewell, Jones and Babbage  were instrumental in the foundation of ""Section F"" (Statistics and Economics) of the British Association in 1833 and the Statistical Society of London in 1834.  Both of these institutions were dedicated to the empirical-inductivist approach, in contrast to the Ricardian-dominated Political Economy Club. The 1834 tests debate At its root, Cambridge University was an ecclesiastical institution, a seminary for the training of clerics for the Church of England.  But Cambridge had always been a little more relaxed about its religious requirements than the more conservative Oxford.  While Oxford required religious tests both at matriculation and to receive a degree, and examined the student carefully for knowledge of the 39 Articles of the Anglican faith, Cambridge dispensed with the matriculation test altogether and only required that a student declare he was a bona fide member of the Church of England to get his degree [following the Cambridge senate resolution, or grace, of June 23, 1772 (txt)].  This allowed Dissenters (non-Anglicans) to enroll at Cambridge and attend classes, even if they could not ultimately graduate with a degree.  As a result, in the course of the centuries, while Oxford maintained itself as the ultimate citadel of orthodox ""High Church"" Anglicanism, Cambridge acquired a reputation as a breeder of Non-Conformists, Puritans, ""Low Church"" enthusiasm and other heterodox strains of religious opinion.  Students may be required to attend college chapel, and occasionally listen to tiresome lectures by Cambridge divines, but otherwise were left to themselves. On March 21, 1834, a group of sixty-two Cambridge residents petitioned the British parliament for the abolition of religion tests for degrees.  The petition was signed by a bevy of senior professors and other notables, including scientists and mathematicians like G.B. Airy, Adam Sedgwick, William Farish, George Peacock and Charles Babbage.  They pointed out that talented Dissenter students found their future professional careers as lawyers, doctors, teachers, etc. severely hampered by lack of a degree. The petition was presented before parliament by the Whig PM Earl Grey. The rest of the Cambridge community balked and immediately arranged a counter-petition, much larger than the original, expressing a desire to maintain the religious tests.  Nonetheless, a bill for removing the religious tests to receiving degrees was soon drafted and introduced.   It was vigorously supported in parliament by  Henry Brougham (then lord chancellor) and George Pryme (then a Cambridge MP).  The debate raged through 1834, in a cascade of pamphlets and articles.  Proponents pointed out it was a minor change,  limited to the BA degrees, a parting gift to graduates on their way out, men who were leaving Cambridge anyway, and would not affect the Anglican character of the university itself in any manner.  But opponents of the bill feared it was the thin end of the wedge, that if passed, then the pressure would be irresistible to remove other religious clauses - to fellowships and scholarships in colleges, say, or to the MA degrees, and consequently university bodies.  A Cambridge governed by multi-denominational councils would lose its fundamental connection with the Church of England. The quarrel soon escalated. Thomas Turton, Dean of Peterborough and the Regius professor of Divinity, deplored the laxity that allowed Dissenters to attend classes at Cambridge to begin with.  A young Trinity tutor Connop Thirlwall offered the reply, partly in jest, that Dissenters did not mind, given that there was so little religious instruction going on at Cambridge anyway, it hardly made any difference. Thirlwall then went on to propose dropping mandatory chapel as well.  Thirlwall's  pamphlet offended the traditionalists, and he was promptly pressed to resign.  The dismissal of Thirlwall quickly became a cause celebre, and many who were originally critical (such as William Whewell), flipped over to the liberal side.   The bill eventually passed the House of Commons, but was thrown out in Lords.  Despite the illustrious names backing it, they were few and too young to be influential, and the conservative forces of both Cambridge and Oxford combined to defeat it. The timing was maybe not perfect, coming on the tail-end of a dizzying sequence of other liberalizing measures that had shocked conservatives - the removal of civil religious tests in 1828, Catholic emancipation in 1829, the parliamentary reform in 1832, Irish church reform in 1833, etc.  By 1834, traditionalists, including the cleric-dominated universities, felt the Anglican church was being besieged, making them adamant about holding the line somewhere, and hyper-vigilant to any further changes.  The 1834 tests debate produced some reactionary blowback - accelerating the ultra-conservative  ""Tractarian"" movement  at Oxford.  However, Cambridge did not experience anything of that kind. The Moral Sciences Tripos William Whewell was elected master of Trinity College in 1841. From this new powerful perch, Whewell finally had the chance to implement his program of modernizing education at Cambridge.    By this time, the push for educational reform was not merely the foreign fantasy of some lone master or philosophical society.  The modern-oriented University College London was up and running, showing how it could be done, and attracting many students.  The needs of growing British industry and the domestic and imperial civil service favored better-prepared graduates.  Unreformed, Cambridge was in danger of losing its inside track to appointments and positions, and shriveling into irrelevance. Whewell was the critical force behind the introduction of the ""Natural Sciences"" and ""Moral Sciences"" tripos examinations in 1848 (a plan for Theological Tripos conjured at the same time was shelved.).  The Moral Sciences Tripos had a difficult birthing history.  In its original 1848 conception, the Moral Sciences Tripos covered Moral Philosophy, Political Economy, Modern History, General Jurisprudence and the Laws of England, a hodge-podge of only faintly related topics.  It may seem that with the Mathematical, Classical and Natural Sciences Triposes in place by 1848, the Moral Sciences Tripos was just an afterthought, a way to just sweep the remaining fields taught by university professors into a single examination (the five topics were examined by the corresponding five professors).  But it can also been argued that Whewell, who was the Knightsbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy since 1838, and chief of the Moral Sciences Tripos, actually believed there was a natural way to weave law, history and economics together, under the grand umbrella of ""natural theology"".  Whatever Whewell's vision may have been, it did not turn out that way.  While economics was on the curriculum, there was little incentive to study it, since in its early years, the Moral Sciences examination consisted primarily of questions about facts of modern history and legal history.  The Moral Sciences Tripos did not attract many students - it did not lead to a B.A. degree (which still had to go through Mathematics or Classics), and its honours were denigrated as the questions called on rote memory rather than skill. With the paucity of students attempting it, the colleges didn't bother to set up lectureships in it. 1856 Reform During the 1834 tests debate, traditionalists at Cambridge had successfully defended religious restrictions by pointing out they were bound by oath to uphold the Elizabethan statutes and the terms of the wills of the founders of the colleges and scholarships.  In the aftermath of their defeat, the proponents of liberalization began examining the statutes themselves in detail. They were 'shocked' to discover that the extensive educational curriculum and requirements mandated in the statutes were quite at variance with practice in the university and colleges.  While it may seem odd in retrospect, the 'discovery' that Cambridge was intended to be an educational institution, rather than an ecclesiastical institution, was something of a novelty.  It gave the liberalizers their opening to argue that parliamentary interference in the internal workings of the university was legally, morally and politically justified.  As the universities were national educational institutions and not private seminaries of the Church of England, parliamentary legislation modifying the statutes would not be 'breaching' some barrier between State and Church.  In their push to reform the statutes, the liberalizers found natural allies in the educational reformers. In April 1850, fifteen years after the tests debate, Sir James Heywood, an MP and Unitarian who had studied (but not taken a degree) at Cambridge, introduced a motion in parliament for a review of the university and college statutes.   The Whig PM Lord John Russell took this in hand and appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the state of Cambridge University.  Parallel commissions were established for Oxford and Dublin.  The Cambridge Commission of five were all Cantabrigians.  It was chaired by John Graham (Bishop of Chester) and included three scientists of reforming bent - mathematician George Peacock, astronomer Sir John Herschel and geology professor Adam Sedgwick [list]  While there was resistance to the royal inquiry by Cambridge university authorities and colleges, it did not reach the same dramatic pitch as the resistance at arch-conservative Oxford.  The subsequent Cambridge Commission report, which was officially delivered on August 30, 1852, was not nearly as harsh either, but in some ways also less radical. Cambridge was commended for the reforms it had already undertaken, and the commission did not recommend changing the celibacy requirement for fellowships, nor removing the existing religious tests for a BA degree (other than extending that same simple bona fide test to other bachelor degrees, like the B.C.L. and  B.M.).  They nonetheless made a general note, that other civil institutions have removed religious barriers and granted equal rights, and that it would be a noble thing if Cambridge kept ""pace with the progress of  enlightened opinion"" and move ""in sympathy and unison with the spirit of the age"", and not  ""estrange itself from the great movement of liberal progress"" (p.44). Parliament tackled Oxford first, and with some difficulty, passed the Oxford reform act in 1854.  It was only two years later that the separate Cambridge reform bill was submitted by Edward Bouverie on May 30, 1846 [Hansard], and passed more easily,  receiving royal assent on July 29, 1856 (19 & 20 Vict. c.88).   Like at Oxford, the Cambridge was to be saddled with a temporary royal Executive Commission  (¬ß1) to oversee the implementation of the reforms.  Cambridge colleges would be given the chance to alter their college statutes themselves (¬ß27), and only if they failed to do so, would the Executive Commission step in and legislate for them (¬ß29) (similarly for the University statutes  (¬ß30-31)) . The act established a Council of the Senate  (¬ß5), composed of 18 persons, including members of the professoriat  (¬ß6).  Secret oaths or conspiracies to resist changes are declared illegal (¬ß22).  The opening of private hostels was permitted (¬ß23-¬ß26).   The act abolished religious tests for all bachelor degrees (except divinity) (¬ß45) - indeed the original motion passed in Commons included the abolition of religious tests for MA degrees (thus allowing Dissenters to sit on government bodies), but the MA restrictions were restored by the House of Lords in the final act.  The act also removed religious restrictions on exhibitions and scholarships (¬ß46).  Unlike the Oxford Act, the Cambridge Act does not contain any clause pertaining to mandatory chapel. The 1856 reform opened Cambridge University to students of Dissenting religions. But the continued religious restriction on MAs, and certain college fellowships and other emoluments,  meant they were still barred from becoming Cambridge fellows, professors and readers.  This barrier to finally removed in 1871, with the elimination of all remaining religious tests.   The celibacy requirement for fellowships was retained until 1882.. Professorship The Moral Sciences Tripos was overhauled by John Grote, who succeeded Whewell in the moral philosophy chair in 1855. In 1860, the Moral Sciences Tripos finally became an honours course for a B.A. degree and a Moral Sciences Board established.  General jurisprudence remained on the Moral Sciences curriculum for a while, although Laws of England was removed to a separate ""Law Tripos"" (for an LL.B. degree) that had been established in 1858.  In its place, Logic and Mental Philosophy (i.e. psychology) was introduced.  Nearly a decade later, in 1867,  Jurisprudence and Modern History (which continued to engulf the examination) was finally removed from the Moral Sciences tripos, and Political Philosophy introduced in its place. (History was initially transferred to Law, becoming ""Law and History"" Tripos in 1870, but it was an unhappy arrangement; they were separated with the formation of the History tripos in 1873).  So with Law and History finally expurged, the Moral Sciences Tripos examination was freed of their dominance. It was really only then that Moral Sciences was given room to develop, and students finally given reason to study economics.  In sum, by 1870, the Moral Sciences Tripos was defined as Moral and Political Philosophy, Mental Philosophy and Logic and Political Economy. The Professorship in Political Economy was only made permanent by the university senate in October, 1863.   The holder was to be paid ¬£300 annually, plus a share of student fees.  The professor would have to stay in residence at Cambridge for at least eighteen weeks per year, and give lectures.  To facilitate its passage, the long-time holder George Pryme resigned the chair.  Contests were immediately opened in November 1863, and four candidates proposed: J.B. Mayor (a lecturer in moral sciences and fellow of St. John's), Leonard Courtney (former professor of political economy at UCL, and also a fellow of St. John's), Henry Dunning Macleod (banker) and Henry Fawcett (fellow of Trinity Hall).  Fawcett had recently published his Manual of Political Economy, which was well-received, and was armed with recommendation from prominent economists (e.g. John Stuart Mill, W.T.Thornton, William Newmarch, Herman Merivale, J.E. Thorold  Rogers among others). Choice of the Professor was by ballot, with the electors consisting of all M.A.s who had maintained residency at Cambridge.  Fawcett won easily.  Fawcett would give an annual course of lectures on political economy at Cambridge for the next twenty years, until his death in 1884. The Cambridge Professor of Political Economy would be on the board of both the Moral Sciences Tripos and the History Tripos, and thus economics classes had honours students attempting either of those examinations.  But it was still a weak course.   The economics textbooks required by Pryme in 1860 (bk) for the examination were thoroughly Classical: Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, Malthus's Essay, Ricardo's Principles, J.S. Mill's Principles, McCulloch's Political Economy, Richard Jones's Rent, Carey's Political Economy and Chevalier's Cours.  Fawcett slimmed it down in 1867 (bk) to Smith, Ricardo and Mill, plus Cairnes's Character and Bastiat's Harmonies. Fawcett's own Manual was used for the special examination for ordinary (poll) degrees. As Mary Paley later recalled, in 1870, the Moral Sciences Tripos had a reputation as ""the course for girls"", as it required neither mathematics nor classics.  But the reputation of Moral Sciences began to ascend with several notable honours candidates in the early 1870s. Local examinations and extension lectures The drive for reforming universities, was followed up by a more general drive for improving all education in Britain. Movements, like the National Education League, pushed for the introduction of general, non-sectarian public schools, reaching its climax in Forster's 1870 Education Act.  The universities were caught up in the fever for expanding education to the general public.  In 1873, Cambridge launched the ""Cambridge Extension"" lectures,. to bring academic fare to adult students outside the university. Foxwell and Cunningham were early extension lecturers on economics.  The idea for university extension lectures was reputedly begun by James Stuart, a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Asked in the Fall of 1867 to lecture on the art of teaching to an audience of school-teachers, Stuart decided to demonstrate it instead, and went on to give a series of lectures on astronomy to various audiences of teachers and artisans in Leeds, Sheffield, Manchester and Liverpool. While public lectures had been routinely sponsored by mechanics institutes and literary societies, Stuart introduced several innovations - courses of multiple lectures (rather than single lectures), syllabi for note-taking, and written examinations by correspondence.  Stuart persuaded some other Cambridge friends to follow his lead in subsequent years, but there was little incentive.  The extension lecturers tried to set themselves up a peripatetic university, hoping to tap into workers' cooperatives for organization and funding, but this proved difficult..  So in 1871, Stuart proposed that Cambridge University incorporate the extension lecturers as an integral part of the university.  A trial period was undertaken, and three fellows of Trinity promptly set out north to the provincial cities of Nottingham, Derby and Leicester, to deliver courses on economics, mechanics and English literature.  The prescribed rules were that an extension course consisted of (1) twelve weekly lectures,  (2) printed syllabi, (3) weekly written exercises, (4) a tutorial class in connection with each lecture; (5) written examinations at the end of the course, overseen by examiners appointed by the syndicate, and the provision of a certificate of completion..  Goschen proposed the adoption of the extension system to London in 1875, and it was accepted and launched in 1876.  Benjamin Jowett pressed the plan on Oxford, and it launched its own university extension syndicate in 1878. It had trouble getting started, and was virtually abandoned a couple of years later.  But in 1885 Oxford revived the extension system by providing for six-lecture courses (cheaper to fund than the original twelve-lecture scheme), and the extension lectures moved onto explosive growth.  Oxford also had lecturers be accompanied by a traveling library, ensuring students had access to the readings in the syllabi, and began bringing in select extension pupils in to Oxford for more intensive summer teaching. 1882 Statutes New statutes for Cambridge University were introduced in 1877, and came into law in 1882.  In the reorganization, there would be a Moral Science board consisting of three professors: Political Economy (Fawcett), Moral Philosophy (T.R. Birks) and Mental Philosophy and Logic (vacant at the time).  In 1883, the utilitarian philosopher Henry Sidgwick succeeded Birks to the Knightsbridge chair of Moral Philosophy.  The third chair (Mental Philosophy) was only filled with the appointment of James Ward in 1897.  By the new statutes, the stipends for the professors were increased to ¬£700 (minus ¬£200 if he also held a separate fellowship at a college).  Professors were required to give annual lecture series and expected to undertake ""research and the advancement of knowledge in the department"".  The fulfillment of these requirements would be overseen by the Moral Sciences Board.   The economics curriculum changed dramatically over time.  The Moral Sciences board (Fawcett & Sidgwick's) 1883-84 reading list still placed Mill's Principles as centerpiece, but included content from more Historicist (Roscher, Cunninhgam, Cliffe-Leslie), Financial (Bagehot, Goschen) and Neoclassical (Walker, Cournot, Jevons and Marshall) literature.  For the economics section of the History Tripos, there were additional readings from Levi, Brentano and Thorold Rogers. Marshall and the Economics Tripos [see also Cambridge Neoclassicals] Fawcett died in November 1884, and a new competition for the Professorship of Political Economy began - which, under the new statutes, were to be chosen by a select committee of nine rather than elected by the much wider body of resident MAs.  There were six candidates in the running - four of them considerably strong and equally matched:  H.D. Macleod  (again),  R.H. Inglis Palgrave (another banker), William Cunningham (a rising economic historian) and Alfred Marshall (then teaching at Oxford). In the end, Alfred Marshall was elected.  At the time, Marshall was still a relative unknown, having few publications compared to the others; but he had a solid reputation as a long-time lecturer (whereas it was a question mark with the others), and close friendships with some of the electors (notably Herbert S. Foxwell),  Marshall gave his inaugural lecture as professor at Cambridge on February 24, 1885.  Almost from the outset, Marshall set about trying to expand the proportion of economics in both the Moral Sciences and History curriculum and exams.  For this, there were titanic struggles behind the scenes in Cambridge.  Marshall's scheme of aggrandizement naturally came up against the resistance of the other two members of the Moral Sciences Board - Henry Sidgwick (Moral Philosophy) and, later, James Ward (Mental Philosophy).  Moreover, Marshall's narrowly Neoclassical vision of what constituted :""economics"" also annoyed natural allies, like the historicist lecturer William Cunninhgam.  But in his endeavor, Marshall had the support of some lecturers. notably Herbert Foxwell and John Neville Keynes.  Eventually, through negotiation, Marshall and Sidgwick gradually agreed on the increasing separation of the philosophical from the economic parts of the Moral Sciences curriculum, effectively accomplished in 1897, allowing students to specialize in one or the other. After Sidgwick's death in 1900, Marshall pressed for a permanent secession, pointing at the example of the LSE (f.1895) as showing the direction Cambridge needed to go.  He finally won his case, and the ""Economics Tripos"" (in full ""Economics and Associated Branches in Political Economy"") was introduced in 1903.  The supervisory Economics Board included the Professor of Political Economy (Marshall), but also the new professor of Moral Philosophy (W.R. Sorley), Modern History (J.R. Bury), Laws of England (Maitland),  International Law (J. Westlake) and Geography (H.Y. Oldham).  A.W. Ward (Master of Peterhouse) was the first chairman of the Economics Board and political scientist Lowes Dickinson was its first secretary.  Marshall still hoped for some overlap - that is, Marshall expected that students in Moral Sciences Tripos would still be required to learn economics in Part I of their degree program, and if they had a taste for it, could transfer over to Economics Tripos for Part II.  But this was denied him - economics was expunged entirely from the Moral Sciences curriculum, and the professor of political economy removed from the Moral Sciences Board. In 1903, the London livery company of Girdlers endowed a lectureship in economics at Cambridge, with an emolument of ¬£100 per annum, to begin in 1904 and run for three years.  Marshall student Arthur Cecil Pigou (who had obtained his degree in 1900) was appointed the first Girdlers' University Lecturer.  The Girdlers renewed their endowment in 1907. In the early years of the new Economics Tripos, there were only three paid instructors dedicated to economics - Marshall as professor, Foxwell as St. John's lecturer and Pigou as Girdlers' lecturer (Neville Keynes, now deep into logic, remained with Moral Sciences).  Other teachers were drawn from other triposes  (e.g. H.D. MacGregor and William Cunningham from history).  Marshall succeeded Ward as chairman of the Economics Board in 1906, and began to prepare his own retirement from the economics professorship.  The succession to Marshall's professorial chair in 1908 was marked by controversy.  The chair had long been promised by Marshall to his former pupil Herbert S. Foxwell, who had reluctantly accepted the chair at UCL back in 1881 (albeit retaining his St John lectureship), on the promise that he would succeed Marshall at Cambridge.  But by the mid-1900s, it was clear Marshall's preferences had changed definitively in favor of Arthur Cecil Pigou.  Marshall placed heavy pressure on on the electors - A.J. Balfour,  Leonard Courtney, F.Y. Edgeworth, J.N. Keynes, J.S. Nicholson, R.H. Inglis Palgrave, V.H. Stanton and W.R. Sorley - and Pigou was elected Professor of Political Economy in 1908.  Later that year, when former Foxwell student, Henry Higgs, proposed to raise money for a second economics chair at Cambridge specifically for Foxwell, Marshall sunk the proposal, openly declaring Foxwell unfit.  To this injury was added insult in 1916, when Pigou petitioned for exemption from military service in World War I, on account that there was ""no one"" at Cambridge able to replace him (Foxwell was still lecturing there).  Pigou years To take up the professorship in June 1908, Arthur Cecil Pigou resigned the Girdlers' lectureship to economic historian H.O. Meredith. At the same time, to make up for Foxwell's departure, the Economics and Politics Board authorized two new lectureships in economics (with a modest stipend of ¬£100 each, paid out of Pigou's professorship).  These were awarded to Walter Thomas Layton (a recent Trinity graduate) and the young John Maynard Keynes (graduated from King's in 1906, Keynes had been since cooling his heels at the India Office in London, waiting for a chance to return).   Meredith would resign in 1911, to take up a post in Queen's College Belfast, and so Keynes moved up to Girdlers lecturer in 1911.  Simultaneously, the second lectureship, held by Layton, was upgraded (made official, with the funds now coming from the general university fund rather than Pigou's pocket).  Rounding off the teaching of economics in this period were the mathematician and moral sciences lecturer W.E. Johnson, tthe economic historians John Clapham and C.R. Fay, and the political scientist Lowes Dickinson. There is little doubt that Pigou and Keynes were the dominant figures at Cambridge, the heirs of Marshall and Foxwell.  In October 1909, Keynes launched the ""Political Economy Club"" at Cambridge, an exclusive discussion club that met on Monday evenings, consisting mostly of faculty (although Pigou rarely attended), graduate students and some bright undergraduates.. Among the new economics students bred during this time by Pigou and Keynes were Dennis H. Robertson (Trinity), Hubert D. Henderson and Frederick Lavington (Emmanuel), Gerald Shove and Hugh Dalton (King's College) and Dudley Ward (St. John's).  The atmosphere was also changing at this time, with the arrival of the Fabian Socialists in 1906, with their open membership and politically fashionable radical ideas.  The Fabians soon became the center of intellectual and social life at Cambridge, gradually eclipsing the older and more detached ""Apostles"". The First World War decimated Cambridge.  Legions of its students had abandoned their studies to enlist, many of them going on to be slaughtered in the trenches of the western front.  Keynes had been seconded to the Treasury, while Pigou lectured to nearly empty classrooms.. With the loss of a generation, its adjustment to the post-war situation were difficult. In the lectureships, Layton would be succeeded by Hubert D. Henderson in 1919 and Keynes by Frederick Lavington  in 1920.  In the early 1920s, this included, besides Pigou and Keynes, Gerald Shove (King's College), Dennis H. Robertson and Frank P. Ramsey (Trinity),  Austin Robinson (Corpus Christi), Frederick Lavington (Emmanuel), and Maurice H. Dobb ( (Clare).  Joan Maurice/Robinson (Girton) was excluded. The Department of Applied Economics was created in 1945, with director Richard Stone.  It merged with the Faculty of Economics in 2004.      Professors of Political Economy 1816 George Pryme

Oxford," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by Oxford University or any other organization. See the official Oxford University website] Contents History Early History The University of Oxford is the oldest university in the English-speaking world, and one of the oldest in Europe. It is said to have been founded around 1167, by English masters and students  expelled from the University of Paris, in the course of the quarrel between Henry II of England and Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury (then in exile in France).  Troubles in 1209 between King John and the Church led to a royal crackdown on the Oxford masters and clerks.  A group of exiled Oxonians are said to have established themselves in the nearby town of Cambridge, creating the nucleus of what would soon become Cambridge University, the ancient and perennial rival of Oxford. Oxford was among the earliest and most prominent of the Scholastic universities of Europe.  Robert Grosseteste introduced the newly-recovered works of Aristotle into Oxford in the 1230s, and went on to produce a famous school of Franciscan Scholastics that included Roger Bacon,  John Peckham, John Duns Scotus, William of Ockham and Richard of Middleton. When Popes started handing out charters granting fledgling universities the privileges of a Studium generale, Oxford (alongside other proud old schools like Paris and Bologna) refused to acquire one, believing their reputation and status sufficient and indisputable.   By the time it realized the privileges were worth having and stooped to apply for one, the pope refused - on the grounds that Oxford was implicated by its association with John Wycliffe and the Lollards.  As a result, Oxford never received a papal charter, one of the only two old European universities (the other was Padua); to have subsisted without one, a Studium generale by custom only Oxford narrowly survived the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII in 1539, by subjecting itself to royal reorganization. During the Henrican reforms, most of the old colleges of Oxford were shut down or broken up, the traditional Scholastic curriculum was purged in favor a more humanistic one.  Henry VIII endowed five ""Regius Professorships"" - in Divinity, Hebrew, Greek, Civil Law and Medicine.  The Elizabethan Act of Incorporation (13 Elizabeth c.29) in 1571 gave Oxford its first formal charter, recasting it effectively as a seminary for the (Anglican/Episcopalian) Church of England.   Religious tests were introduced in 1589.  Students residing in a college were required to officially matriculate in the central university, and affix their names to a subscription book confirming the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Anglican faith (compiled by the Synod of London in 1562).  This ""matriculation test"" was unique to Oxford (Cambridge did not require it), thus effectively barring any  Non-Conformist Protestants, Catholics and Jews, from entering the university.  Oxford also had a ""degree test"", where they in order to receive their B.A. degree, students had to prove their knowledge and confirm the validity of the 39 articles, the Book of Common Prayer and swear an oath to the supremacy of the King (Cambridge had the ""degree test"", but not so detailed; it was sufficient for the candidate to declare he was a member of the Church of England).   Oxford maintained the religious matriculation and degree tests until 1854. In 1606, James I allowed Oxford to send a representative to Parliament.  With the rise in popularity of Calvinist-inspired Puritanism in the 17th C., Cambridge's looser entry requirements allowed it to flirt with the new mood and Cambridge soon acquired a reputation as a breeder of Puritans and Low Church ""enthusiasm"". However, Oxford maintained itself steadfastly traditional, the bastion of ""High Church"" Anglicanism, upholders of traditional ecclesiastical institutions, devoted to the central notion of the union of church and state, and firmly tied to the Stuart monarchy.  Thus it is unsurprising that during the English Civil Wars of the 1640s, King Charles I made Oxford his political and military headquarters.   Oxford's fortunes rose and fell with the Stuarts. After the 1688 Glorious Revolution, Oxford's devotion to the Stuarts made it a Jacobite hotbed, never quite finding a way to reconcile itself with the Williamite and Hanoverian monarchies. Structure The 1571 Elizabethan constitution was overhauled by the ""Laudian statutes"", assembled under the supervision of William Laud (Archbishop of Canterbury and Chancellor of Oxford), that went officially into force on June 12, 1636.  The Laudian statutes would remain the effective constitution of Oxford University until the mid-19th C.  The statutes were very detailed, regulating the relationship between the central university and the constituent colleges, all the way down down to curriculum, examinations and student life. In theory, the government of the university was the Convocation, the notional assembly of all the masters and doctors, resident and non-resident, who maintained their names on the books of one of the constituent colleges.  It served something like a ""legislature"" for the university (e.g. the Convocation elected the Chancellor, the two MPs, etc.)  However, in practice, power was vested in the so-called ""Hebdomadal Meeting"", a smaller oligarchic council  which alone had the power to initiate changes to be voted by the Convocation.  The Hebdomadal council was composed of the heads of Colleges and Halls plus the two ""Proctors"" of the university (proctors were notional representatives of the rest of the university community).  The figurehead of the university was the Chancellor, who in turn appointed a Vice-Chancellor from among the heads of the Colleges.  The Vice-Chancellor customarily had a four-year term and did most of the actual presiding in university meetings.  Up until 1854, Oxford was composed of 19 ""Colleges"" (only a handful of which were founded after the Reformation) and five ""Halls"".  A College was essentially a residential house for students. Each college had a stable of thirty or so 'fellows' who acted as tutors and lecturers for the undergraduates. In principle, fellows were recent graduates who had received their B.A. but continued residing at the college and were paid a small emolument to 'mentor' undergraduates. By statute, the fellows of a college were expected to be ordained into the Anglican priesthood after seven years. However, a fellow who took up the additional task of lecturing could prolong his fellowship without ordination.  However, a fellow was still required to remain unmarried, and any fellow who married would promptly forfeit his fellowship (a codicil that was only changed in 1882.)   The head of a College had a variety of names depending on the college (""Master"", ""President"", ""Provost"", ""Warden"", etc.).  The head was elected by the fellows of his college, with no involvement by the rest of the university. His primary obligation was administrative and spiritual supervision (thus heads were almost always clerics), but usually did not get involved in educational matters, leaving that to the fellows. The difference between a College and a Hall was that a Hall did not offer fellowships or scholarships, and the head of the Hall (almost invariably known as the ""Principal"") was appointed by the Chancellor of the University.  Lack of fellows meant that the Principal of the Hall had to take on more of the educational functions himself. University College (f.1249), Balliol College (f.1263), Merton College (f.1264) have all set out claims to be the oldest still-existing Oxford colleges.  Oriel College (1326) is the oldest to be founded by a royal and for a time enjoyed a reputation as the most liberal and intellectually accomplished, the home of the ""Noetics"" of the19th Century (Copleston, Whately, etc.).  New College (1379) is often credited for pioneering the quintessentially Oxonian system of education, notably the tutorial system. Christ Church College (1525) is traditionally considered the most prominently aristocratic and conservatively High Church, while St. John's (1555), founded by merchant fortunes, was reputedly the richest.  Other old colleges include Exeter (1314), Queen's (1341), Lincoln (1427), Magdalen (1458),  Brasenose (1509), and Pembroke (1624).  Hertford College (formerly Hart Hall) was notable as a collection of point of Renaissance humanists.  Among the colleges designed only for graduates is the prestigious All Souls College (f.1438) and the more modern economics-oriented Nuffield College (f.1937). Traditional curriculum Since Scholastic times, the traditional Oxford curriculum for a Bachelor of Arts encompassed the classical ""seven liberal arts"" - the the 'interpretive' trivium (grammar, rhetoric and logic) and the 'factual' quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music).  Undergraduate degrees (""Bachelor of Arts"") were obtained after an oral Latin disputation, focused on language skills and mastery of logic, and demonstrated familiarity with religious knowledge (with focus on the Thirty-nine Articles of the Anglican Church).  The 1638 Laudian statutes replaced the Latin disputation with a final oral examination on the set of subjects that were required to be taught by statute.  The course of studies set out by statutes were: in the first year, grammar and rhetoric (in a wide humanistic sense), second year, logic and moral philosophy, third & fourth: logic, moral philosophy, geometry and Greek. Although Oxford had hosted William Petty and Thomas Hobbes in the mid-17th C., Oxford's Jacobitism ensured it remained isolated and insular.  In relative terms, Oxford missed out on much of the ""Scientific Revolution"" that raged nearby at Cambridge.  The 18th Century is sometimes considered the ""academic dark ages"" of England, and Oxford in particular.  Students barely attended lectures, and the oral examination deprecated into routines with little actual testing of student's knowledge.  Although Elizabethan statutes (13 Elizabeth c.29) fined students for non-attendance of lectures, this was largely ignored and unenforced. Oriel Noetics During the 18th C., while the Scottish academies had embraced the Enlightenment and a curriculum in modern disciplines, such as moral philosophy and natural sciences Oxford labored under the weight of its Medieval Scholastic heritage. Attempts to modernize the curriculum at Oxford had largely failed - the Whyte Professor of Moral Philosophy (est. 1631) had long since ceased lecturing and was so entirely forgotten, the title stopped being listed on university calendars.  The Regius Professor of Modern History (est. 1724) fared only a little better.   For the most part, in the 18th C., Oxford was regarded little more than a training ground for Anglican clerics, dominated by ultra-Tory High Church views, and a finishing school for gentlemen, with an archaic curriculum dominated by Greek and Latin Classics, and degrees which were hardly earned.  Edward Gibbon famously mocked 18th C. Oxford as a sleeping place for dons.  Adam Smith, who attended Balliol College, Oxford in 1740-46 on a scholarship, had nothing good to say about his experience there.  Things began to change at the turn of the century, with the introduction of competitive ""honours"" examinations in 1800-09 and an overhaul of the curriculum with more exacting educational standards, albeit still dedicated to the classicsal liberal arts.  The locomotive was Oriel College, initially under the leadership of John Eveleigh (provost of Oriel from 1789 to 1814), and then Edward Copleston (provost of Oriel from 1814 to 1827).  Eveleigh had introduced competitive examinations and a new policy of selecting students for intellectual potential rather than family connections, turning Oriel arguably into the most meritocratic college at Oxford in the early 19th C. As a result, Oriel was quickly blessed with a generation of talented young men, bent on intellectual achievement (or over-achievement, by the standards of the day).  Copleston mentored a generation of fellows and students at Oriel known as the ""Noetics"" (Greek for ""reasoners""), that flourished in the 1810s and 1820s, which included Richard Whately, John Davison, Edward Hawkins, Thomas J. Arnold, J. Blanco White, Baden Powell, Renn Dickson Hampden, and others. Oriel Noetics acquired (and cultivated) a reputation as hyper-intellectuals, the leading lights of the university. They also constituted the Oxford branch of the ""Broad Church"" movement, promoting liberal theology and freedom of enquiry, which often stood in stark contrast to the stuffy conservative ""High Church"" Tory outlook that dominated the rest of the university at the time. Political economy was not absent in this transformation.  The Regius Professor of Modern History (f.1724) had always touched on political and economic topics.  This became more pronounced under George Beeke, a fellow of Oriel and Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford from 1801 to 1813. Beeke famously produced an early attempt to measure national income, in an effort to estimate the revenues of the Pitt income tax.  His contemporary, Edward Tatham, the Rector of Lincoln College, had also been involved in public finance matters of the Pitt ministry - crediting himself (without modesty) as the author of the property tax of the late 1790s, and continued to be an occasional commentator on the bullion debate.  Edward Copleston encouraged inquiry and discussion on political economy in the Oriel common room, and dabbled in the field himself, publishing tracts on the bullion controversy and the Poor Laws. In 1808-10, a series of articles appeared in the Edinburgh Review, the latter-day pulpit of the Scottish Enlightenment, deriding the archaic Scholastic curriculum of Oxford, and the centrality given to Aristotlean logic and Christian theology, at the expense of modern subjects like mathematics, science, philosophy and economics.  Copleston rose to the occasion, and authored a Reply to the Calumnies (1810), effectively the ""Noetic manifesto"", defending the Oxonian curriculum.  While acknowledging the importance of economics to general education of the statesmen the English universities turned out, Copleston nonetheless saw economics merely as a science about a ""means to an end"", and insisted on the importance of classical and religious learning to provide the normative basis, the ""value of the end"".   Copleston's program was taken up by his disciple Richard Whately, who led the Oriel Noetics through the 1820s. In his famous textbook, Elements of Logic (1826), Whately famously rescued logic from its dilapidated state in the Scholastic curriculum, and recast it as a modern science of inquiry, setting the field on the road to formalization in the 1830s.  Another Noetic, Renn Dickson Hampden, revived the ancient forgotten professorship of Moral Philosophy in 1831. Economics enters Oxford On May 11, 1825, Oxford accepted an offer by Henry Drummond to endow a Chair in Political Economy.  The offer was viewed suspiciously by the conservative High Church dons of Oxford. Not only were they wary of this new secular science, many believing it incompatible with Christian ethics and teaching, they were a little suspicious of Henry Drummond himself. Although a former student, Drummond had never taken an Oxford degree and had since become the leader of a rather extreme ""Low Church"" evangelical sect in Albury Park. Nonetheless, the Oriel Noetics, led by Whately, urged acceptance. Political economy, they argued, was rapidly becoming indispensable field for statesmen. Oxford purported to educate the future leaders of Britain, and if Oxford did not teach them economics, they would simply pick it up from the London gutters - from the irreligious Ricardians and Radical Utilitarians, who were staking the field as their own exclusive province, and infusing it with their profane ethics and vulgar principles. If Christian thought and ethics are to have any influence on the new science, then economics must be brought inside the cloister, where it can be taught ""properly"". Moreover, Cambridge already had a lecturer in political economy - George Pryme, since 1816 - surely Oxford should have one too?  The Oxford dons held their nose and approved it.   In the original terms, the Drummond chair in Political Economy would receive annual stipend of ¬£100 funded by Henry Drummond from his Albury estate. Candidates must have an advanced Oxford degree (at least an M.A. or a Bachelor of Law), and were to be elected by the Convocation of all masters. The Drummond professor would serve for a fixed term of five years, and could not be re-elected unless a two year interval had passed (this restriction was lifted in December 1867 for Bonamy Price). The professor was required to deliver nine lectures per academic year (October-July) and publish at least one of them. Finally, a lecture must have at least three attendees in order to count.  Whately was instrumental in securing the appointment of his own former pupil and friend, Nassau William Senior, as the first Drummond Professor of Political Economy in June, 1825.  However, Senior took over a year to prepare, and was only ready to deliver his first lectures in December 1826. Although they were rather poorly attended, Senior soldiered on. Senior published many of his lectures, staking out the theoretical and policy positions of what can be called the ""Oxford-Dublin School"", sometimes regarded as a branch of Classical economics, but more properly as a proto-marginalist challenge to it.  After Senior's five year-term ended in 1830, Whately took over the Drummond Professorship himself - but stayed for only a year before accepting a position as the new Archbishop of Dublin in late 1831 (he went on to establish the Whately chair at Trinity College Dublin in 1832, on similar terms as the Drummond chair, which would continue the theoretical line begun at Oxford). Whately's departure in late 1831 led to the appointment of William Forster Lloyd to the Drummond chair at Oxford. Although himself a proto-marginalist, Lloyd was not quite of the school of Whately-Senior - indeed quite the opposite.  W.F. Lloyd was the younger brother of the powerful Charles Lloyd, Bishop of Oxford and Regius professor of Divinity.  Although Charles Lloyd had died in 1829, during his lifetime Lloyd's Christ Church had been a keen competitor of Copleston's Oriel for the soul of Oxford.  The transition in the Drummond professorship from Richard Whately to W.F. Lloyd in 1831 mirrored a decisive transition away from the reformist 'Broad Church' liberalism of the Oriel Noetics towards the reactionary High Church conservatism championed by Christ Church and Lloyd.   Tractarianism The transition really began when Charles Lloyd beat out Edward Copleston in the competition for the Bishopric of Oxford in 1827 (Copleston got the Bishopric of Llandalf - a virtual sentence of exile).  At the time, the conservative High Church community at Oxford was growing alarmed at the fraying of the traditional marriage between Church and State in an increasingly liberal England.  Although the conservative wing of the Tory Party, under the Duke of Wellington and his lieutenant Sir Robert Peel (a protege of Lloyd), had come to power in early 1828, they seemed incapable of reversing the trend. Indeed, Wellington and Peel presided over the repeal of the Test and Corporation acts in 1828, and, in early 1829, passed the Catholic emancipation act.  The Oxford community howled in protest  and forced Sir Robert Peel, Oxford's long-standing Tory MP,  to resign.  Discontent took a more dramatic turn in 1831, when N.W. Senior (then in London) authored a report for the new Whig government effectively recommending the disestablishment of the (Anglican) Church of Ireland.  Blamed by association with Senior, Whately found the atmosphere in Oxford increasingly hostile, and so did not have to think twice when the Dublin preferment came up.   In the aftermath of Whately's departure, the remaining Noetics at Oxford were besieged.  Hampden had assumed the Whyte professorship of moral philosophy in 1831, and pushed the Noetic envelope further in his Observations on Religious Dissent 1834, advocating the abolition of religious tests and allow the admission of Dissenters into Oxford University (a side-effect of the 1834 Cambridge petition to Parliament).. Hampden's pamphlet served as a lightning rod to send the High Churchmen into a frenzy.  The younger men of Oriel - notably John Keble, John Henry Newman, Richard H. Froude, Edward Pusey,  and others - groomed by the old Noetics but subsequently lulled by Lloyd,  revolted against their elders.  They were appalled by what they perceived as the open collaboration between the Noetics and the Whig government in dismantling the institutions of the Anglican Church, and the apparent willingness of the rest of the clergy to simply go along with it.  This group of youngsters - known later as the ""Oxford Movement"" or simply ""the Tractarians"" - blamed not the Whigs, nor parliament, nor the general public, but rather placed the blame squarely on the clergy themselves.  The ""attack"" on the Church of England was not external, but internal.  In their estimation,  the clergy had grown so used to being part of the State, that they had practically forgotten they were part of the Church. The clergy did not vigorously defend their institutions and traditions, partly because were ignorant of them or did not appreciate their history and importance, and partly because they had reconciled themselves to subservience to the will of the State.  The ""confessional sate"", the idea that parliament served effectively as the ruling synod of the Church of England, might have worked well enough in the long decades of conservative Tory rule, but parliament was now in the hands of liberal Whigs, and included non-Anglican Dissenters and Catholics as MPs. In short, secularizers and unbelievers were in charge of the church.  The Anglican church needs a new, separate identity, or more precisely - the Tractarians argued - to recover its old identity as a separate institution with its own distinct history, functions and social role. Keble, Newman, Froude, Pusey et al. consequently decided to correct that.  Starting in 1833, the group began to put out a series of pamphlets known as the Tracts of the Times.  Most of these were innocuous historical tracts, more interested in educating about church history than in engaging in abstract theological polemics.  Their research into the history of the church morphed into a zeal for the revival of traditional High Anglicanism of the Caroline divines and a Romantic-tinged fascination with Medievalism.  The Tractarians urged a revival of old rituals and liturgies, bringing back vestments, candles and incense, to add color and inspire the imagination, and re-center church service on the holy communion and its mystery.  The parish church should be re-cast not only as a spiritual center of the community, but also a social institution.  The parish priest should present himself as a community leader, not a state official, and assume the role of a countervailing force, rather than a conduit, of harsh state policies of the Whig era (like the Poor Laws) The Tractarians dominated intellectual life at Oxford in the 1830s and early 1840s.  The hyper-conservative, ultra-High Church views espoused by the Tractarians not only shocked their more liberal elders - like Hampden and Baden Powell, who were still at Oxford - it was also at odds with the general sentiment outside of Oxford.  While their call for preserving the centrality of the Church of England institutions in English public life found some resonance, their emphasis on its traditional features, and calls for a return to older rituals and liturgies in the Church of England faced more resistance.  Critics derided their ""smells and bells"" ritualism and accused them of trying to reintroduce relics of ""Romanism"" into a solidly Protestant church.  The Tractarians did not disavow the connection, and indeed emphasized the continuity between the Medieval Catholic church in England and the post-Reformation Church of England, seeing an unbroken line of apostolic succession, and a continuation of the sacraments. The Tractarian conflict with the Noetics entered into high phase in 1836 with the vacancy of the powerful Regius Professorship of Divinity.  The Noetics proposed Renn Dickson Hampden, then in moral philosophy, but the Tractarians pushed for Edward Pusey or Keble or Newman or anybody else but Hampden.  They hit the pamphlets, with accusations that in his 1832 Bampton lectures (on the history of the Scholastics), Hampden had postulated some irreligious ideas, insinuating that morals and theology had no connection with scriptural revelations. This was a caricature of Hampden's position - Hampden merely sought to show that the Scholastic arguments were historically conditioned, influenced by contemporary events.  In many ways it was orthodox Protestantism, suggesting the Scholastics were not authoritative over scripture, but it was precisely this that irritated the Tractarians, who were trying to revive the authority of the Patristic Fathers of the church.  The High Church leaders of Oxford only heard  that Hampden believed things like the Nicene creed or the doctrine of the Trinity might be mistaken, and hurriedly declared him unfit for the position.  Nonetheless, the Whig government (pushed by Whately and Copleston) went ahead and appointed Hampden to the professorship.  It was met by a storm of protest in the Oxford community. The Tractarians and High Churchmen launched a campaign to retract the appointment, composing petitions to the King, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and urged other dioceses to join in the push.  When they seemed to make no headway with the government, the Tractarians went so far as to have the Convocation of Oxford pass a statute declaring the university had no confidence in Hampden, removing him from the boards selecting preachers and reviewing sermons, and releasing students of theology from the obligation to attend his lectures.  Although the statute was later declared illegal, it infuriated the Whig PM Viscount Melbourne, who was determined to hold his ground against pretensions of the ""rebels of Oxford"" to seize control of appointments.  Hampden appointment to Divinity was confirmed, but in an act of mollification William Sewell, a sympathizer of the Tractarians, became the new Whyte professor of moral philosophy.  William F. Lloyd's tenure in the Drummond Chair came to an end in 1837, and the search for his successor began at the height of the Tractarian movement.  Sewell persuaded the theologian and future Christian Socialist, Frederick Denison Maurice to stand for the chair, and the Tractarians stood behind him.  The Noetic candidate, Herman Merivale, a Whig and former Whately student at Oriel, threw his hat into the ring, but stood little chance.  Maurice's candidacy, favored by the High Churchmen, seemed a sure thing but then Maurice made some remarks on infant baptism that instantly turned the Tractarians against him.  With Maurice's candidacy lost, Herman Merivale (whose political Whig views were deplored, but at least had never made any religious comments of any kind) slipped into the Drummond chair by default.   Merivale's tenure ended in 1841, and Senior himself decided to submit his candidacy.  But the High Churchmen were still riding high, and the chair went to a lawyer, Travis Twiss, instead.   The Tractarians finally crossed the line with their (in)famous ""Tract No.90"", authored by John Henry Newman in 1841 - effectively concluding that Anglicanism and Catholicism were essentially the same thing, that the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Anglican faith were compatible with Roman Catholic theology.  Or more precisely, in Newman's meticulously razor-thin difference, the Articles were ant-Roman, but not anti-Catholic. It garnered a vociferous response - by Whately among others.  Sympathizers like William Sewell broke with the Tractarians and Richard Bagot (Bishop of Oxford) suppressed further publication of the Tracts.   Despite the scandal of Tract No. 90, the leaders of the Tractarian movement lingered on at Oxford, with significant personal influence, for a few years more.   But times were about to change.  The Tractarians lost the battle for the Professorship of Poetry, which had been vacated by Keble in 1841. Their favored candidate, Isaac Williams, was soundly defeated, partly because of Pusey's own supportive circular letter had inadvertently identified some irregular religious opinions. Emboldened by this victory, the Hebdomadal Council decided to follow it up in 1842 by vacating the 1836 statute against Hampden.  In May 1843, Pusey was accused of delivering a sermon on the Eucharist contrary to Anglican doctrine, after a brief secretive inquiry, found guilty and barred from preaching at Oxford for two years.  The final straw was the publication in 1844 of the Ideal of the Christian Church by William G. Ward, a disciple of the Tractarians, practically condemning the Anglican Church as faithless compared to Catholicism.  The Oxford authorities launched an inquiry into Ward's book.  In February 1845, at the Oxford Convocation, Ward's book was condemned and Ward stripped of his degrees. A third measure, that would have empowered the Vice-Chancellor to launch an inquisition into the orthodoxy of any university member at any time, was vetoed by the Proctors.  But it was only a temporary stay until the end of the Proctors' term of a year.  In the aftermath, the Tractarian movement began to crumble.  A stream of resignations followed in the course of 1845, as Tractarians one by one gave up their posts and future careers. Several the Tractarians (notably starting with John Henry Newman in late 1845) formally converted to Catholicism proper.  The Oxford Movement did not end, but it would have to continue outside of Oxford. The discrediting of the Tractarians also weakened the High Church hold on Oxford after 1845.  After fifteen years, the old Noetic Liberals were finally back on top.   In 1847, Nassau William Senior had few difficulties being elected again to the Drummond Chair in economics.  Senior would serve his second term until 1852.  But greater changes were about the befall Oxford. 1854 Reform Debate over curriculum continued in the meantime.   In the 1830s, the old battle between the Scottish school and Oxford was resumed in the Edinburgh Review, this time between the Scottish philosopher Sir William Hamilton, a professor civil history at Edinburgh, and Vaughan Thomas, an Oriel graduate. This time, the debate was not on the content of the curriculum as much as its implementation. Hamilton derided the tutorial format and argued in favor of lectures, blaming the fragmentary organization and excessive power of Oxford colleges. He also demanded that the classics be approached ""philosophically"", rather than ""philologically"".  The Scottish-educated Whig-Liberal prime minister Lord John Russell took the matter in hand with the appointment of a 1850 Royal Commission to inquire into the state of the university. It consisted of seven commissioners, all respectable Oxonians, but many of them also liberals and reformers, connected with the old Oriel Noetics.  This included the chair, Dr. Samuel Hinds (Bishop of Norwich), Whately's own chaplain, the lingering geometry professor Baden Powell and Archibald C Tait (a follower of Thomas Arnold).  Another Arnold disciple, Arthur P. Stanley was appointed to the powerful position of secretary to the commission   Conservatives protested the composition of the commission, and the Oxford University authorities refused to cooperate.  The Convocation petitioned Queen Victoria to declare the commission unconstitutional, as it interfered with the college founder's wills.  Even after its legality was established, Oxford moved into passive resistance - the university and the colleges refused to supply information to the commission, or even reply to its inquiries.  But the Commission had its allies -  notably the Oxford professors, most of whom had long hoped for reform but had been hitherto powerless.  The professors filled in and provided  the information and evidence the authorities and colleges declined to provide.  The Oxford Commission Report came out in the Spring of 1852 (although formally dated August 30).  And its findings were harsh - indeed quite harsher than the equivalent report on Cambridge. The 1852 Commission Report characterized Oxford University authorities as an ecclesiastical oligopoly, its colleges negligent, and its students merely clerical office-seekers.  The education it offered was irrelevant and collegial instruction ineffective.  There was little or no studying going on, students were mostly idle, college life indolent, most of their time occupied with ""fornication, wine and betting"".  The commission commended the incentives of the honours examinations, but wanted curricular reform across the board.  As it stood, the Oxford curriculum provided no preparation for professional life, not even for the clergy.  Logic, Oxford's central compulsory subject, was of dubious value, and only served to help students avoid mathematics.  The 1852 report set out several recommendations: (1) open up the university administration to include the professors in government bodies, (2) stop relying on colleges, strengthen the central university, build up a corps of university teachers to do the bulk of the instruction; (3)  allow specialization in the curriculum, focus more attention on mathematics and the sciences, (4) remove the ordination requirement for fellows (albeit keep the celibacy requirement), (5) abolish special privileges reserved to certain families, schools or local districts, remove restrictions on scholarships and fellowships and open them up to competition on merit, (6) do something about making it cheaper, so middle class students can attend, e.g. increase number and value of scholarships, allow students to reside in licensed private halls or hostels, rather than colleges.  Pointedly, the report did not, however, recommend lifting the religious tests - although they did point out that the matriculation oath was probably a bad idea (young students should not make solemn oaths about things they do not yet understand). The Commission Report was harsh enough to change the mind of William E. Gladstone.  At the time, Gladstone was not only Russell's chancellor of the exchequer, he was also a member of parliament for Oxford University, a confirmed High Church man and had been one of the most vocal and strident opponents of the royal commission in 1850.  Now, Gladstone took it upon himself to draft the Oxford Reform Bill, incorporating the commission's recommendations, and submitted it to parliament in March 1854. The subsequent debate was acrimonious, but the the bill passed and the Oxford Reform Act (17 & 18 Victoria, c.81) received royal assent on August 7, 1854.  Gladstone wanted to give the university a chance to reform itself.  He wanted to avoid the spectacle of debates on open Commons floor, with wild parliamentarians writing statutes dictating the inner workings of the venerable ancient university and colleges.  Instead, the Act set up a small Executive Commission with statutory powers to oversee the process..[¬ß1]  The university and colleges were asked to reform their statutes and implement the changes in the 1852 report by themselves..[¬ß28]   Only if they failed to do so by a certain date (Michaelmas, 1855), would the Executive Commission step in and legislate for them.[¬ß29]   The 1854 reform act left the old government bodies intact, but added a new one, the ""Congregation of the University of Oxford"" which included the professoriat (professors, deputy professors and public examiners), [¬ß16], as the 'new' legislative body, the older Convocation now merely serving as a kind of upper house. The Hebdomodal council was also opened to include at least six professors  [¬ß5].   The Hebdomadal council still initiated legislation, but it went through the Congregation first, and only in the end was thrown up to the Convocation for final approval.  The veto power of the Convocation was circumscribed only in the next century, in 1926, as a result of the 1922 Asquith Commission. In teaching, the changes in the 1854 act were also not so dramatic.  Many of the older university professorships were reset on new terms, strengthened and their number expanded.  But the college tutorial system remained.  The federal power of the central university was increased, but the colleges were still very powerful.  The curriculum did began to change - although to be fair, changes had already begun before the report. Not only in economics under the Drummond professors, but also in the natural sciences, with geology (under William Buckland and Charles Lyell) leading the way.  The Oxford museum of natural history had opened already in 1850. Indeed, Oxford was probably moving at a faster pace than Cambridge at this time.  The main obstacle to curricular reform was not so much institutional, as personal.  Many professors simply did not have the time or inclination to build it up.. The repeal of religious tests was not recommended by the 1852 Report, nor in Gladstone's original 1854 bill.  They believed that the religious question should be dealt with separately, and did not want to risk sinking university reform because of it.  But the lifting of religious tests had been demanded for very long by Radicals and the urban Dissenters that formed the popular base of the Whigs.  The question was virtually unavoidable, and was fiercely fought during the Commons debate.  It was also influenced by the contemporary Northcote-Trevelyan report, proposing to overhaul the British Civil Service, open up competition and recruit on merit.  As many of these position would require degrees, maintaining the religious tests to exclude Dissenters from universities would be needlessly narrowing the pool of talent from which the civil service could draw.    The removal of many (but not all) religious tests was included in the 1854 act  - most notably the oath at matriculation and the oath at taking a B.A. degree (except for Divinity) [¬ß43 & 44].  Dissenters (non-Anglicans) were finally allowed to matriculate and get BA degrees from Oxford University.  However, the religious test was not lifted from the MA degree, and as a result they were still excluded from participation in Oxford government bodies.  Nor did they lift any religious restrictions that might be attached to college lectureships, fellowships or scholarships. The struggle for full repeal continued, and bills to abolish all remaining religious restrictions was introduced in 1863, and thereafter again yearly,  G.J. Goschen was one of the prime promoters of the campaign at Oxford (Fawcett was equally vigorous at Cambridge).. Gladstone's Liberal party put it on their platform in 1864, but could not get it passed before the Conservatives returned to power in 1865 (Gladstone lost his Oxford seat as a result).  But the fight continued.  After repeated tries, the bill finally passed Commons in 1866, but failed at Lords. The Liberals returned to power in 1868, and kept trying. At last, in 1870, they included it in the Queen's speech.  After a year's delay, it was finally passed.  The remaining religious restrictions were abolished in the 1871 University Tests Act (34 & 35 Victoria c.26) [site, bk]  Teachers of any belief are allowed to sit on university bodies.  It would take some time to implement, and in 1877 an Executive Commission was appointed to sniff out and repeal of any remaining religious restrictions in the nooks and crannies of college endowments and fellowships.. In sum, the 1854 Reform made university government more democratic, reorganized and strengthened the professoriat, set curricular reform moving towards modern specializations, and got rid of special privileges and religious restrictions.  It significantly changed the character of Oxford -  it broke the ecclesiastical grip on the university, cleared out the clerical office-seekers and set it on track to becoming a proper educational institution.   Student enrolment climbed in the aftermath. Needless to say, the Tractarians, already in decline, were finished off by the 1854 Act.  The days of high clericalism and doctrinal quarrels were over.  The old vision of the Noetics, the educational philosophy of Copleston, Whately and especially Arnold, triumphed in the aftermath. Although the colleges were still powerful, a new generation of tutors emerged - such as Benjamin Jowett at Balliol College - whose mission was not merely to teach classics and mathematics, but to mold the character and morals of Oxford students in a broader secular sense.  Although the new, expanding post-reform professoriate nudged it in a scientific direction, with more specialization, it did not embrace the German model, it did not focus on research.  Oxford's new educational mission was the holistic training of leaders, politicians, civil servants and teachers, for the benefit of Britain and the British empire.  It is a mistake to conclude that Oxford became more open in the aftermath of the 1854 reform.  In certain ways, it became more exclusive and elitist than ever. With the clerics gone, Oxford became more firmly a finishing school for the affluent and powerful.  True, it became slightly less aristocratic, but, at the same time, also less accessible to the lower classes.  Post-reform Oxford became essentially the private province of the new upper middle classes, with the goal of turning the children of wealthy manufacturers, merchants and professionals, into a new gentlemanly ruling class. In the half-century between 1854 and 1904, Oxford was essentially closed off to the poor, and contributed to the increase, rather than decrease, of social class divisions in English society.  This had not always been the case.  A clerical career had always been the ticket for bright but poor children to escape their social station.  The original purpose of the Oxford colleges, when they were erected back in the 14th and 15th Centuries, was precisely to provide room and board for poor students.  The children of the nobility and gentry had invaded the colleges after the 16th C. Reformation, but the lower classes were never closed off.  There were ample amounts of scholarships and exhibitions available to the poor, and grammar schools erected and affiliated to the colleges provided a ladder inside. All this was now gone.  The 1854 Act, in sweeping away ""special privileges"", also swept away Oxford's traditional (however rickety) affirmative action for the poor.  Clauses about needy students or local districts were erased, and open competition  for places and scholarships on the basis of merit alone usually meant they were all snapped up by the upper classes.  With the old public and grammar school connections severed,  a series of new private boarding schools rose up in the wake of the reform - Cheltenham, Haileybury, Malvern, Rossall - to prepare the upper middle class children for the competitions. The lower classes did not stand a chance. Oxford's new class exclusivity was famously condemned in Thomas Hardy's 1894 novel, Jude the Obscure. Nonetheless, in 1857 Oxford, and later Cambridge, adopted a system of local examinations in secondary schools. This was initiated on a voluntary basis by Sir Thomas Acland and Dr. Temple Economics in Post-Reform Oxford In the tractarian and reform years, economics at Oxford still traveled on its own course.  Nassau William Senior returned and  held a second five-year tenure as Drummond chair (1847-52).  As far as economics was concerned, things changed little in the immediate aftermath of the 1854 reform. Economics integration in the Oxford curriculum was tentative.  From the outset, it was originally merely an optional subject in the honours course on Literae Humaniores (Classics),  although as late as 1909 it is noted that rarely more than one question on economics was found on the classics exam, and was underweighed anyway.   The Drummond Professorship of Political Economy was organized under the School of History.  With the 1854 reforms, a new honours course in ""Law & Modern History"" was introduced, for which political economy was a subject.  History was strengthened by the establishment of the Chichele Professorship of Modern History in 1862 and the separation of the law component into its own course in 1873.  Modern History (containing economics) quickly became the second most popular honours course, behind Literae Humaniores (Classics).  Familiarity with political economy was also a subject for the general non-honours examination.  In 1873, the recommended textbooks were Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations and  J.S. Mill's Principles and (for lower level) Fawcett's Manual and (later) F.A. Walker's First Lessons. In 1876, the Cobden Club offered a prize of ¬£20 (bumped up ¬£60 in 1881)  for the best essay in economics by an Oxford student (to be awarded every three years). The terms of the Drummond professorship were also revised.  The two-year interval condition was revoked in December 1867, to allow Bonamy Price to serve consecutive terms.  In 1877, the Oxford University statutes were revised and the university added to Drummond's original endowment, bringing up the stipend to ¬£300, supplemented by an additional ¬£200 fellowship at All Souls College. The manner of election was also circumscribed, the convocation was set aside and the candidate was to be now elected by a special board consisting of the Chancellor of the University, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Regius Professor of Modern History, the Whyte Profesor of Moral Philosophy and a fifth elector chosen by the fellows of All Souls.   The 1877 revision led to the further conversion of college fellowships into university professorships. It also established a Common University Fund to finance a new slate of readers and lecturers (albeit no new ones in economics yet). It is to the English historical school, notably the lectures of Bonamy Price and J.E. Thorold Rogers in economics and T.H. Green and Arnold Toynbee in modern history, that interest in economics grew in the 1880s.  Alfred Marshall happened to also be a lecturer at Oxford during this period. Some of the new crop of economic-oriented students included William J. Ashley, John A. Hobson, G.J. Goschen, L.L. Price and Edwin Cannan.  Many stayed on, whether as history fellows or as Oxford extension lecturers, and went on to form organizations like the Social Science Club (1885) and the Oxford Economic Society (1886). The Christian Social Union, a organization primarily consisting of young churchmen for the study and advocacy of ""Christian social principles"", was established at Oxford on November 16,1889. A London branch was set up in 1890, and a division of labor set up - the Oxford branch mainly focusing on economics (from a fact-collecting bent), the London branch mainly doing the outreach (lectures, sermons, etc.) Other branches of the CSU were soon set up in many other cities (including Cambridge), but the Oxford and London branches were by far the largest. The Oxford branch's journal, The Economic Review, established in 1891, was edited by William J.H. Campion (Keble), John Carter (Exeter) and Lancelot R. Phelps (Oriel), and became, for a brief time, something of an organ of English historicism. The arrival of Francis Ysidro Edgeworth as Drummond Professor in 1891 changed matters.  An economic theorist, Edgeworth deflated the historicist energy that had bubbled up during the 1880s.  Edgeworth primarily relied on the theoretical economics of Mill and Marshall for the lion's share of the lectures, and economic history was gradually reduced to a single course out of seven  (Mill's Principles was still the required text in 1909).   Edgeworth was an unpopular lecturer and attendance was scant.  Nonetheless, Edgeworth was content with the space offered and did not push for an expansion of economics in the curricula.  This finally led L.L. Price to complain to the Oxford Hebdomadal council in 1902 that the study of economics had fallen to a point of near-extinction among students.  Price pointed to Cambridge's growing strength in economics, and the imminent introduction of the economic tripos there, suggesting Oxford needed to catch up.  This led to the establishment of a special post-graduate ""Diploma in Economics"", overseen by a special seven-member Committee of Economics, to encourage more systematic study of economics at Oxford.  The Diploma lectures and examinations began in 1904, consisted of five papers - three required papers on economic theory, the history of economic thought, and economic history, and two elective papers on any mix of these (including applied topics). 20th Century Oxford Economics finally ascended with the establishment of the honours course in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) in 1920. The Oxford Institute for Statistics, organized under director Arthur L. Bowley,  served as a gathering point for emigr√© scholars in the 1930s-40s fleeing fascist-dominated Central Europe, most notably Michal Kalecki, but also Thomas Balogh, Fritz Burchardt, Kurt Mandelbaum, E.F. Schummacher and Josef Steindl. The Keynesian Revolution filtered from Cambridge into Oxford in the 1930s initially through Roy Harrod (lecturer at Christ Church since 1922, and a close correspondent of Keynes) and James Meade (fellow at Hertford College since 1930, who had participated in the ""Cambridge Circus"" in 1930-31; Meade left Oxford in 1937).   In the late 1930s, Harrod launched what we have called the ""Oxbridge Programme"", connecting Keynesian macroeconomics with dynamic theories of growth and cycles.  In this effort, Harrod was joined by Kalecki (until he left in 1945) and subsequently John Hicks (who arrived in Oxford in 1946 after a spell at LSE, Cambridge and Manchester). The Keynesian macroeconomist James Meade returned in 1967 as a research fellow at Christ's College.  Another professorship of economics was created in 1969 (to be later called the Edgeworth Professorship of Economics) and first held by James Mirrlees (brought in from Cambridge).  A Professorship of Economics at Nuffield College was established for Amartya Sen (coming from LSE) in 1977.

Appointments to the Regius Professorships are made by the crown. In the 1618-23 period, during the latter part of the reign of James I, a series of new professorships were created by private endowments (Natural Philosophy, Geometry, Astronomy, Moral Philosophy, Ancient History, Anatomy) A series of university statutes in 1854 led to the suppression of several college fellowships and their conversion into university-wide professorships. This process was furthered by the 1877 revision of statutes.  For instance, the University converted five fellowships endowed by to All Souls College, to establish two new ""Chichele professorships"" (International Law, Modern History).  Fellowships of Magdalen college were converted to establish  four ""Waynflete professorships"" (""Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy"",  Chemistry, Physiology, Mathematics).  Fellowships at Corpus Christi College produced three ""Corpus Professors"" (Latin Language, Comparative Philology, Jurisprudence), fellowships at New College funded ""Wykeham professors"" (Logic, Physics) while fellowships in Merton College were used to create the ""Linacre Professor"" of comparative anatomy subsequently two more Merton-funded chairs (English Literature, Classical Archaeology & Art - the latter with Lincoln's help). New statutes in 1877 upped the stipends for many of the professors by attaching to the chairs to fellowships in specific colleges. Drummond Professorship in Political Economy Founded 1825 by London banker Henry Drummond, formerly of Christ Church, with an endowment of ¬£100 per annum. The professor was elected by convocation and had to have an Oxford degree and residence. Under its terms, the professor was required to deliver nine lectures on political economy per year, and publish and print at least one of them.  The term of the Drummond professorship was five years.  Originally, nobody could be re-elected to it until after a two year interval had passed. This clause was repealed in December 1867 (Bonamy Price being the first to benefit from it).  From 1877, Oxford added ¬£300 p/year to the Drummond chair, with an additional ¬£200 for a fellowship at All Soul's College.  The Drummond Professor was elected by a board consisting of the President of the University, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Regius Professor of History, White Professor of Moral Philosophy, and a representative of the Warden and Fellows of All Souls.

University College London," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by University College, the University of London or any other organization. See the official University College London website] University College London (UCL) was founded in 1826 as ""London University"", and reorganized in 1858 as a constituent college of  an overarching ""University of London"". For centuries, London had remained one of the few European capitals without a university.  There were some institutes of higher learning -- Gresham College, founded by Thomas Gresham in 1597, funded professors who held public lectures in London, but took no students nor awarded degrees.  While Scotland counted four major universities (Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, St. Andrews), England made do with two (Oxford, Cambridge). Mechanics Institutes The London Mechanics' Institute (future Birkbeck College) claims to be the first college in London still extant. It was part of the ""mechanics institute"" movement of the 1820s to provide modern technical education for adult working people. Its primary purpose was to bring machinists, artisans and engineers of the burgeoning Industrial Revolution in contact with the principles and latest research in modern science, principally physics and chemistry, with a view to their practical application to solving problems and improving industrial machinery.  Its origins trace back to 1796, when University of Glasgow professor John Anderson, who had routinely conducted public lectures on the practical applications of science, endowed an institution (initially, just a single professor) to continue the effort.  In 1799, the Scottish physician  Dr. George Birkbeck was appointed to the Andersonian institute. Seeing an interest by working class students, in 1800 Birkbeck launched the first special course for mechanics.  In 1804, Birkbeck left Glasgow for London, and eventually became involved in the London Institution (f.1805 by Sir Francis Baring), a library of scientific works, which also conducted public lectures, albeit in a general direction.   Back in Glasgow, Birkbeck's dedicated mechanics course at the Andersonian was continued for a while by Andrew Yure, but the institute preferred to focus on topics of intellectual interest to the middle classes, neglecting the practical course for the working class mechanics. The first dedicated mechanics institute was launched as the School of Arts in Edinburgh in 1821 by Leonard Horner  (brother of Frances Horner).  Inspired by their example, the Glasgow mechanics defected from the Andersonian insitute and, with the backing of well-wishers, established their own Glasgow Mechanics Institute in July 1823.  That same month, a similar ""Mechanics and Apprentices Library"" (later Institute) was launched in Liverpool.  Still within the year, down in London, George Birkbeck had thrown his support behind a new popular science publication, the Mechanics' Magazine, published by J.C. Robertson.  In one of its early issues (Oct 11), Birkbeck wrote of these recent developments and his own past experience in the mechanics course at the Andersonian, and proposed the foundation of a similar institute in London.  On Birkbeck's initiative, a public meeting was held in November and the London Mechanics Institute was founded in December 1823, with the support of a panoply of London luminaries, such as Whig politician Henry Brougham, Radical activist Francis Place, philosopher Jeremy Bentham, classical economist Robert Torrens, Ricardian socialist Thomas Hodgskin, journalist William Cobbett and publisher T.C. Hansard.  In 1824, more mechanics's institutes and libraries were established in Ipswich, Manchester, Newcastle, Leeds, Lancaster, Aberdeen, etc. The fever took hold, and mechanics institutes would multiply and spread to other industrial towns in the subsequent decade. Foundation of London University The project for establishing a proper university in London was hatched in 1825, by Thomas Campbell, a Scottish Romantic poet.  Campbell broached the project in a letter to Henry Brougham (published in The Times, Feb 9, 1825). Campbell's original argument was merely that a university in London would be a great convenience to students from the metropolis, saving on the hefty boarding expenses of Oxford and Cambridge, and making a university education affordable to middle class London families.  Campbell's intended catchment was the London business community, and pointed to great German urban universities, like Berlin and Vienna, as the model.  But Brougham immediately saw a second angle - the London business community contained a very significant proportion of religious minorities, specifically, Protestant Dissenters and Jews, who were blocked from Oxford and Cambridge degrees because of religious test, who could be potentially interested in such a scheme. Brougham arranged a meeting at the London Tavern on July 1, 1825 presided over by the Lord Mayor, and attended by many prominent London figures - Whig political leaders, Philosophical Radicals, Company masters, and a host of businessmen - to listen to the poet's project.  To Campbell's idea that a great metropolis needed a great university, Brougham attached the twist that it would be non-denominational.  Not only would there be no religious tests, but no religious subjects would be taught.  It turned the project into political dynamite (the meeting elicited a satirical poem by Praed in the Morning Chronicle) From the outset, it was agreed the Oxbridge educational model would not do. Nor would simply copying the Scottish one.  Despite their urban locations and the founders' backgrounds - Campbell had fond memories of Glasgow, Brougham of Edinburgh - the Scottish universities still targeted primarily country gentry, rather than urban populations.  Brougham dispatched Campbell to Germany to research university models - basically getting him out of the way. Back in London, Brougham essentially took over the project himself, handling the organizing, fund-raising and political furor. University College London (UCL) was formally founded on February 11, 1826 under the name of ""London University"".  It was set up as a non-denominational  school as an alternative to the religious tests of Oxford and Cambridge.  Dissenters, Jews and others were accepted at the ""Godless college on Gower Street"" or the ""Cockney College"" (as it was popularly referred to).   It was frequently regarded as the utilitarian academy, as it counted philosophical radicals as Jeremy Bentham, James Mill and George Grote among its early benefactors, and followed their practical educational philosophies.  But it had an equally strong presence of Dissenters among its founders, notably Thomas Wilson and the evangelist Zachary Macauley, and a significant Jewish contingent headed by Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid.  Perhaps fittingly, London University was organized as a joint stock company, offering shares at ¬£100 at 4 per cent interest to the public. Widely-subscribed, London University raised an initial capital of ¬£153,000.   Government of the university was by a ""Council"" of 24 members, composed of eminent London gentlemen and patrons elected by the proprietors.  The professors were represented by an advisory ""Senate"", with prerogatives over academic affairs.  The Council's first chairman was the Whig politician Henry Brougham  then rector at Glasgow, and an economist's favorite, who would preside for the next forty years.  Leonard Horner (brother of Frances Horner) was its first warden.  The Greek-themed domed main building (variously referred to as the 'Octagon', or 'Bloomsbury' building), designed by William Wilkins, began being constructed on April 30, 1827.  The university opened its doors for classes in October 1828.  First decade The University of London was launched at half-cock, and would remain somewhat chaotic in its first decade.  It still had no charter and no parliamentary act, and thus no power to grant degrees.  In December 1830, the university submitted a petition to parliament to allow it to grant degrees, and it was on the verge of being granted, when Oxford and Cambridge combined to defeat it. London University had made the conscious decision to forego the 'Oxbridge' curriculum, focusing instead on 'modern' subjects, like living languages, medicine, astronomy, chemistry, economics, subjects of 'practical' men of science and sense (""promotion of useful learning"" was the catchphrase).  But Latin and Greek were not abandoned, and there were also chairs in more exotic topics, such as Oriental Literature, Hindustani and Hebrew. (1831 faculty at London)  In a sense, economics was established at the university before the university itself.  In 1824, a committee of Political Economy Club members, (which included James Mill, Thomas Tooke and George  Grote), raised money to fund a series of paid public lectures in London on political economy in memory of David Ricardo (who had died in 1823).  They persuaded John Ramsay McCulloch to deliver the Ricardo lectures, which they anticipated would be conducted with regularity  at some rented facility.   However, the creation of London University in 1826 prompted a revision of the plan.  It was decided that the Ricardo memorial lectures would be translated to that venue, and the lecturer would occupy a Chair on Political Economy at the new university.  Formally established in 1828, the Ricardo lecturer John Ramsay McCulloch was naturally appointed the first professor. Two other initial hires in 1828 were the young logician Augustus de Morgan as Professor of Mathematics and the scientist Dionysius Lardner as Professor of Natural Philosophy (Science) and Astronomy.  De Morgan would almost single-handedly carry the fledgling university to new intellectual heights.  As it happens, Lardner, together with Thomas Dale (English) and John Williams (Latin), all three of whom were ordained Anglican priests, promptly arranged for the delivery of Divinity lectures - basically in violation of the university's founding principles - and the acquisition of an Episcopal chapel adjoining the main building.  Anatomy seemed to be a perennial problem - the first appointee never showed up.  The second choice, Grenville Pattison, was judged sufficiently incompetent to provoke a student revolt and was summarily dismissal by the Council in 1831  In protest at the Council's intrusion in professorial affairs, de Morgan resigned ""within twenty minutes"".    No less controversial  was the appointment of the philosophy chairs.  There were two chairs envisaged: a Professor of ""Moral and Political Philosophy"" and a Professor of ""Logic and Philosophy of the Mind"".   The original candidate for the first chair, Thomas Southwood Smith, (a physician friend of Bentham's) was rejected by the Council on the grounds that a professor of moral philosophy ought to have some training in theology (or philosophy, for that matter - Southwood Smith was a physician; his greater claim to fame would be to later dissect and embalm Bentham's body, producing the ""autoicon"" which to this day is on display in the main hall of UCL.).  The original candidate for the second chair, John Hoppus (a student of Scottish philosopher Dugald Stewart) was opposed by the utilitarian radical George Grote.  Grote argued the appointment of Hoppus, an ordained Congregationalist minister, was inconsistent with the university's non-denominational premise.  Grote forwarded his own candidate, the jurist Charles Hay Cameron, for the chair, but it was resisted by the Council.  So, for the first couple of years, a university ostensibly founded by utilitarian philosophers, did not teach any philosophy at all.  The deadlock was finally broken in 1830, when, availing themselves of Grote's absence, the Council swiftly approved John Hoppus's appointment to the chair of Logic and Philosophy of Mind.  Grote resigned in anger, and broke with his old friends Henry Brougham and  James Mill.  As Grote had been doing a lot of administrative heavy-lifting at the young institution, it did not bode well for the future. Nonetheless, Hoppus would continued to serve as the lone philosopher at the university for the next thirty-five years.  The fledgling university in London had encountered a new challenger almost immediately.  The Tory fathers of London decided to counter the ""Godless one"" by establishing a proper Anglican university - King's College, London - in 1829, armed with a royal charter (something London University lacked). The design of the KCL curriculum and even the admissions policies were practically identical, only religious tests remained for the professors.  This cut deeply into London University's attraction and contributed to its financial straits. And the university was facing serious financial problems indeed.  The initial salary offers (a guaranteed ¬£500) to lure the professors had been over-optimistic, and were gradually ratcheted down by exigency (¬£300, without guarantees).  To make up for shortfalls, high student fees were instituted, but this only kept students away.    As financial woes mounted, the relationship between the Council and the professors deteriorated. De Morgan and  Lardner had resigned in 1831. McCulloch's courses dwindled and had to be cancelled in 1831 and 1832, leaving McCulloch in a financial bind, nursing a grudge against Brougham and Mill, whom he blamed for mismanagement. In 1834-35 session, McCulloch delivered his last course, to an audience of seven.  After McCulloch finally resigned from the position formally in 1837, the economics chair at UCL was declared vacant. (it was poor consolation that King's College discontinued its own economics lectures at around this time too)   Nonetheless, London University managed to hobble along.  In 1834, it opened North London Hospital (now University College Hospital) for its medical students.  In the meantime, by deft diplomacy, Augustus de Morgan had been lured back in 1836, in the hope that he might infuse some life into the crumbling school. It paid off.  A highly popular lecturer and scholar, De Morgan attracted and energized the students and became the paramount figure at the university for the next three decades.  He produced several exceptional students, like Isaac Todhunter and E.J. Routh, who would become Senior Wranglers at Cambridge. Many of De Morgan's students would go on to form the London Mathematical Society. University College The state of the university had fallen in sufficient disrepair to promote a radical rethinking of its organization.  Despite repeated petitions, London University (unlike King's) remained bereft of a royal charter, and thus remained unable to grant degrees. Its stock price had plummeted, trading at ¬£23 by 1836.  The 1834 religious tests fracas at Cambridge however softened opposition.  There was an evident need for Dissenters to get degrees somewhere, and allowing London to grant them would weaken the pressure on Oxbridge to reform.  But opposition now came from the medical schools in London and the Royal College of Surgeons (who did not give out degrees).  It was also opposed by King's College London, who did not want to allow London University to monopolize the  ""University of London"" brand. At length, a compromise was reached with the Whig government of Viscount Melbourne.  In November 27, 1836, a new, overarching, degree-granting, examining institution was chartered - the ""University of London"" - and that same day a separate charter for ""London University College"" was issued to the previously-named London University.  Thus it was only now that London University was renamed ""University College London"" (to many, still an awkward name).  The ""University of London"" was a Board of Examiners modeled on the Senate House in Cambridge, with the power to examine candidates and confer degrees in three areas - Arts, Law and Medicine - to candidates presenting themselves from only two colleges - University College London and King's College London.  However the London charter reserved the right to examine candidates from other institutions (""whether in the metropolis or elsewhere in the United Kingdom"") sometime in the future.   UCL and KCL continued to be run as independent universities, except for the degree examinations.  The overall University of London was to be governed by a Senate of royal appointees. (By an unusual oversight, the charter was granted ""by royal will and pleasure"", thereby expired a few months later upon the death of William IV in 1837 and had to be renewed by Queen Victoria).  This seemed to signal a new beginning for UCL.   But the university started recovering its footing only slowly.  By deft diplomacy, Augustus de Morgan was lured back to UCL in 1836, in the hope that he might infuse some life into the crumbling school. It paid off.  A highly popular lecturer, De Morgan attracted and energized the student body and became the paramount academic figure at the university for the next three decades.  He produced several exceptional students, like Isaac Todhunter and E.J. Routh, who would become Senior Wranglers at Cambridge. Many of De Morgan's students would go on to form the London Mathematical Society.   The resumption of political economy did not seem to be of great urgency. Although a public subscription had been raised in 1839 to house David Ricardo's library at UCL, the subject itself went untaught for nearly two decades. In 1853, Manchester New College, a peripatetic northern Unitarian academy of some distinction, moved to London, and sapped some of the strength away from UCL, particularly in philosophy, where MNC's James Martineau ran rings around UCL's uninspiring Hoppus.  A  deal was eventually struck, where UCL would specialize in the secular subjects, and leave theological philosophy and related subjects to MNC.  UCL students wanting to study moral philosophy in depth would usually just walk across town and sign up for Martineau's courses (as Jevons did, in 1860). In 1853, Jacob Waley, a former de Morgan student, finally reopened lectures on economics at UCL.  Although more of a lawyer than an economist, Waley revived the defunct Chair in Political Economy that McCulloch had left vacant nearly twenty years earlier. (It is instructive that the King's College chair was revived simultaneously by lectures in commercial law.) 1858 Charter But new radical changes were afoot.  In 1858, after nearly a decade of agitation, the charter of the University of London was amended, allowing graduates to form a society, with a say in the administration, including the right to nominate one-quarter of the academic senate.  But even more revolutionary was the opening of the university's examinations and degrees to outsiders.  On the eve of 1858, the University of London had 37 affiliated colleges, most of them theological colleges of Catholic, Baptist, and other minority denominations. Students of any of these affiliate colleges could sit for University of London examinations and degrees upon presenting proof of two years matriculation at any of the affiliated schools.  But in a new measure introduced in 1858, all the London examinations and degrees (except medicine) were opened up to anyone, whether studying at an affiliated college or not.  It caused a bit of an uproar at the time, but it was soon settled and the external examination system took root. In 1866, a new crisis erupted again at UCL.  The philosophy professor John Hoppus retired, opening his chair in Logic and Mental Philosophy up to competition again.  James Martineau, the professor of philosophy at Manchester New College, was nominated unanimously by the professorial Senate as the best candidate.  But, as chance would have it, Martineau was an ordained Unitarian minister.  Once again, George Grote, who had returned to the UCL Council in 1849, rankled the anti-clerical chains and blocked Martineau's appointment.  Grote forwarded his own candidate, the young and inexperienced George Croom-Robertson (a student of utilitarian philosopher Alexander Bain but who had drawn the greater part of his learning in the German academies).   John Stuart Mill - along with half of the newspapers of London - were drawn into the fray. Although not on the UCL Council himself, Mill was virtually there by association.  At any rate, as the pre-eminent living philosopher in England, Mill's opinion was bound to be decisive. In the end, Mill sided with his old friend Grote.  In explaining his decision to Martineau, Mill noted that Croom-Robertson ""would certainly teach doctrines much nearer"" to his own.  Mill went on to note that ""opportunities are so few & unfrequent of obtaining for opinions similar to my own their fair share of influence in the public teaching of this country....I shd think myself bound, in the general interest of philosophical thought no less than my own form of it, to give the preference to a candidate ... who would teach my own opinions"".  (Mill to Martineau, July 5, 1866) It was not Mill's most honorable moment (even if bluntly honest).  Mill's treatises on logic, philosophy and economics, were required reading at Oxford, Cambridge and practically every other school in Britain; it was Martineau's own theoretical bent - Idealism - that was struggling for a hearing.  The decision to reject Martineau was not well-received by the faculty.  Although he had no connection with  Martineau, UCL's leading professor, Augustus de Morgan resigned in protest on the principle of the matter.  Economics chair Jacob Waley called on former students, like Walter Bagehot, to rally in support of de Morgan's stance.  But this time, unlike back in the 1830s, Grote would prevail and de Morgan would not return.  Grote himself succeeded Brougham as chairman of the council of the university in 1868.  Upon his death in 1871, Grote provided an endowment for the Grote Chair in Logic and Philosophy of Mind, on the condition that it not be held by an ordained minister.  In 1876, Croom-Robertson made up for his controversial appointment by helping found Mind, the first English academic journal of philosophy and psychology. In the meantime, busy at the bar, Jacob Waley resigned from the political economy chair in 1866, and a competition for succession was opened up.  The banker-economist H.D. Macleod threw his hat into the ring, but he was too controversial (and too openly anti-Millian) a figure.  The chair went instead to one of John Stuart Mill's lieutenants, the Irish economist John Elliot Cairnes. (curiously, Cairnes was allowed to retain his chair at Queen's College Galway throughout his tenure in London).  But the sickly Cairnes could hardly bear the strain. T.E. Cliffe-Leslie, then at Queen's College Belfast, stood in for Cairnes' lectures for one year (1869).   In 1867, two more changes were made to the charter: the university was allowed to return a member to parliament and allowed women into the examinations.  In 1871, Cairnes took the unprecedented step of allowing women to join the men in his lectures, thus hosting the first co-educational university class in Britain.  A supplemental charter in 1878 finally allowed women to receive full degrees.   Cairnes's health faltered, and he retired from the economics chair in 1871.  He was succeeded by his old rival and now friend Leonard Courtney (this time Mill's favored candidate - Cliffe-Leslie - had not prevailed).  Courtney would hold the economics chair until 1875, when William Stanley Jevons, a former student of De Morgan's at UCL, was appointed.  Unable to immediately break his commitment to Owens College, Jevons proposed to have the young Herbert S. Foxwell, one of Alfred Marshall's prize pupils at Cambridge, fill in for him at UCL for a semester. Jevons retained the political economy chair at UCL until 1880, when ill-health forced him to retire.  Herbert S. Foxwell seemed the natural candidate to succeed him.  However, Foxwell expressed reluctance to leave Cambridge, where he hoped to succeed Marshall.  It is alleged that it was Marshall himself, eager to hold the UCL chair for the Neoclassical school, that persuaded Foxwell to accept the London appointment, on the promise that it would be only temporary and that Foxwell would brought back later to Cambridge upon Marshall's own retirement.  But this did not come to pass.  The promise was not fulfilled. Upon his retirement in 1908, Marshall passed the Cambridge chair to Pigou instead. Foxwell would remain at UCL until 1928. Throughout his tenure, Jevons had urged an expansion and deepening of economics, with greater emphasis on the emerging science of statistics. UCL had yet to find an answer to the establishment of the Tooke Professorship and the Statistical Society of London at King's College.  This was finally rectified in 1883.  Following the death of William Newmarch, a special memorial fund was created for a ""Newmarch Lectures on Economic Science illustrated by Statistics"" at UCL, with a modest emolument of ¬£60 contingent on the delivery of six annual lectures.  Unlike regular courses, the Newmarch Lectures was open to the general public. Notionally, the professor of economics (i.e. Foxwell) was the supposed to deliver the Newmarch lecture every year, but could appoint someone else as ""Newmarch Lecturer"" in his place.  Foxwell chose to deliver all the Newmarch lectures up to 1890.  Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, was the first outsider appointed Newmarch lecturer in 1891. The University of London entered into an identity crisis during the 1870s and 1880s, with the expansion of so many constituent colleges outside of London - including in the British empire, in Sydney (f. 1850) and Bombay (f.1857).  The relationship between the university and the colleges, between the examining function and control of teaching, was a mess.  Both UCL and KCL contemplating seceding from the London system, and founding a new university on their own (among various names floated was ""Gresham University"").  The British government set up multiple inquiries - the Lord Selborne Commission (1888-89), the Cranbrook Committee (1891) and the  Earl Cowper Commission (1892-94) - to resolve the question, but failed to come up with a acceptable solution.  Sidney Webb broke the impasse after the creation of the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1895.  He proposed the solution of a two-decker system, whereby the colleges were to retain control at the undergraduate level, but the faculties and board of studies would be intercollegiate.  Post-graduate study was to be in the hands of a professoriat concentrated in one or two higher faculties. In 1886, professors were allowed into the Council for the first time.  In 1900, the London School of Economics, which had been founded five years earlier, was admitted as a constituent college of the University of London.  In 1901, Foxwell sold his massive economics library (some 40,000 volumes) to the Goldsmiths' Company of London, which promptly donated it to UCL (Foxwell went on to amass another collection of 20,000 volumes, but this second library was later sold to Harvard, forming the Kress Library) (to be completed)

See the official King's College, London website] King's College, London (KCL) was founded in 1828/9 by a group of Tory fathers under the leadership of the then-prime minister Arthur Wellesley (Duke of Wellington).  It was the orthodox Anglican answer to the non-conformist  University College London (UCL). King's College was originally set up on the east side of Somerset House on the Strand and, although it did allow the attendance of Dissenters, Jews, and others, only professing Anglicans could hold offices or professorships. In 1836, both King's and University colleges joined forces as the founding schools of the University of London system.  Religious tests would remain in force at King's until 1903.  Although King's College has never had an economics department, it had an important role in the history of economic thought for hosting pioneering professorships in the political economy in the 19th C.  In 1831, following on the recent footsteps of Oxford, Cambridge and UCL, King's College set up a professorship in political economy.  The first holder, Nassau William Senior, was controversially forced to resign shortly after for having published a pamphlet recommending the transfer of some of the revenues of the (Protestant) Church of Ireland to support the Roman Catholic institutions of the island.  With benefactors threatening to withdraw their funding from the fledgling institution, Senior stepped down. He was replaced by Richard Jones, who would hold the chair until 1835, when he departed to succeed Malthus at the East India College in Haileybury.   The chair fell subsequently vacant. In 1853, on popular demand, Leone Levi was invited to prepare a set of lectures on commerce and commercial law, but an formal appointment withheld until 1855, when Levi entered the Church of England.  In 1859, a public subscription by admirers Thomas Tooke  led to the creation of the Tooke Professorship of Economic Sciences and Statistics at King's College.  The emolument was meager (a mere ¬£50) and the condition was at least twenty public lectures per year, of which ten would be given in the evening to allow the working public to attend.  The appointments were managed by the Tooke Memorial Committee, headed by Tooke's friend, William Newmarch. The first holder of the Tooke chair was J.E. Thorold Rogers, who would hold that chair (simultaneously with the Drummond Professorship at Oxford) until 1890.  He was succeeded by F.Y. Edgeworth and, a year later, the Cambridge historicist, William Cunningham.  In 1873,  the Gilbart Lectures on Banking were inaugurated by King's College, named after J.W. Gilbart and aimed largely and City bankers and clerks. In 1874, the Statistical Society of London, in which Newmarch, Rogers, Levi, Guy and others had been so active, moved to new facilities on the King's College campus. In 1919, during E.J. Urwick's tenure as Tooke Professor, a deal was reached between King's College and the L.S.E. transferring the Tooke Professorship to the latter, in return for a chair in palaeography.  As part of the deal, King's College committed not to teach economics, and LSE not to teach languages.  The rough purpose was to prevent overlap between the two University of London colleges and allow the LSE to specialize in social sciences and KCL in sciences and humanities.  Although the deal was revised in 1935, to this day, King's College does not have an economics department. After Urwick death in 1908, the Tooke Professorship at L.S.E. fell into intermittent abeyance.  It was revived in 1931 for Friedrich Hayek, then again in 1958 for A.W. Phillips and once more in 1982 for the econometrician Denis Sargan.

Manchester,"  [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the University of Manchester or any other organization. See the official Manchester University website] As perhaps the leading industrial city of Britain and home of the ""Manchester School"" of free trade activists, it is natural that the denizens of that city would try to assert themselves on the English academic landscape in the 19th C. The early history of higher education in Manchester is dominated by three notable institutions - Manchester New College, the Manchester Mechanics Institute and Owens College. At the time, English higher education was dominated by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. However, they were explicitly Anglican institutions and historically inaccessible to religious minorities - Oxbridge's religious tests were removed only in 1854, and it was still barred to non-Trinitarians until 1871.  Religious minorities - which include Non-Conformist Protestant sects (Presbyterians, Baptists, Quakers, Unitarians, etc.), Catholics and Jews - erected their own parallel system of education, frequently high schools or ""academies"", primarily to serve the children of rising merchant and manufacturing classes in major urban areas (where religious minorities were concentrated).  As the dissenting academies were not preparing their students for entry into Oxbridge, they were not compelled to follow the traditional grooves of Greek-Latin ""Classics"" curriculum, but had the flexibility to develop an independent curriculum.  As a result, they tailored their curriculum on modern subjects, more similar to the Scottish universities - science, modern history, modern languages, etc..  As a result, it can be argued the dissenting academies were some of the best schools in England.  The dissenting academies were preparatory to a business or commercial career most of their students would likely follow (lack of a university degree, as well as religious tests, would bar them from the civil service and many professions). Manchester was for a time the home of one of the best of the dissenting academies, that approached a university level of education open to dissenters: Manchester New College, a Unitarian stronghold with something of a footloose history.  It started in 1756 as the ""Warrington Academy"", where Priestley taught and Malthus attended.  It then moved to Manchester in 1786 (where it went under the name of Manchester Academy), then on to York in 1803 (renamed Manchester College), returned to Manchester in 1840 (renamed Manchester New College).  While still retaining its name, it moved to London in 1853, finally to Oxford in 1889, where it eventually settled on its final name, Harris Manchester College (it became an Oxford college proper in 1996). During its stay in London, it was the perch of the philosopher James Martineau, who attracted students like Philip H. Wicksteed and W. Stanley Jevons (from nearby UCL).  The mechanics institute movement. launched in 1821 and swept through the country, focused on technical teaching of adults.  The Manchester Mechanics Institute was set up in April 1824 by Mancunian industrialists, notably banker Benjamin Heywood, for the training of artisans, engineers and scientists.   The Manchester Mechanics Institute would evolve into the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST). The idea of a dissenting university - or more precisely, for a modern, non-denominational school of higher education in England - had been shown to be viable with the the establishment of University College London (UCL, f.1826)   In 1846, a dissenting Mancunian cotton merchant, John Owens, left in his will a substantial endowment for the foundation of a strictly non-denominational college, following the Oxbridge program of study, with no religious tests whatsoever.  The principal idea was not to create businessmen, but rather to provide higher training for teachers for the other dissenting academies and institutes.  The result was Owens College, founded 1851 under the leadership of Owens's friend and trustee, George Faulkner, the kernel of what would later become the University of Manchester. Its first premises were in a former home of Richard Cobden on Quay Street.  Although initially designed for day classes for non-residential students, in 1853, Owens College opened the doors for its first evening classes, directed primarily at schoolmasters, as a way to bulk up enrollments and achieve its civic mission.  From the outset, Owens College found itself with more chairs than professors. Rev. Alexander John. Scott, the first principal of Owens, was also professor of English language and literature, grammar, logic, mental and moral philosophy.  Scott's administrative tenure was not a particular success and Owens ran into financial difficulties.  In 1857, Scott relinquished his principalship in favor of Joseph Gouge Greenwood, the professor of classics, who would ably steer the university until 1890.  Greenwood fought for and won the support from well-wishers in the Manchester business communities (many of them Anglicans and Congregationalists turned away from Manchester New College and without many other options).  Soon Owens College was back on sufficient financial footing to move to its current premises on Oxford street in 1873. In 1854, the professor of ancient and medieval history, Richard Copley Christie, was given the Faulkner Chair of Political Economy and Commercial Science (the next year, he would also be saddled with jurisprudence and law).  Finding the burden too much to handle, Christie relinquished the economics chair in 1865 to W. Stanley Jevons, a young tutor who had been hanging around at Owens since 1863. Jevons also temporarily filled in for the ailing Scott on logic, which would translate the next year into a separate professorship in logic, moral and mental philosophy. The death of Richard Cobden in 1866 brought forth the endowment for the creation of the Cobden Lectureship in Political Economy, to be conjoined with the economics professorship.  The terms of the Cobden award obligated the professor to deliver a weekly course of evening lectures on economics to the public (primarily, schoolteachers).  A bump in the emolument and the glittering name of the ""Stanley Jevons Professorship"" was added in 1899.  The first incumbent to hold that title was Alfred W. Flux, who had been lecturing at Owens since 1893. Inspired by the University of London's ""federal"" system of colleges, Owens College attempted to create a federation of northern autonomous civic colleges - the Victoria University - the idea being they could eventually set their own examinations and confer their own degrees.  Victoria University was chartered in 1880 with Owens College as its only constituent member.  As a condition of the Victoria charter, it had to open its doors to women students, something principal Greenwood tried to resist until 1883, when forced by court order.  Owens was joined in the Victoria system by University College Liverpool in 1884, and the Yorkshire College of Leeds in 1887.  The application of Firth College of Sheffield to join the system in 1895, was famously (and controversially) turned down. In 1902, the Balfour Act allowed for the development of civic colleges into universities.  Consequently, in 1903, UC Liverpool left the Victoria system to become the University of Liverpool.  Yorkshire College followed suit in 1904, going on to become the University of Leeds.  Owens College was alone again, now recast as the Victoria University of Manchester.  In 1903, soon after S.J. Chapman had inherited the Cobden professorship by Flux's departure, a Faculty of Commerce was established at Manchester to teach banking, industrial organization, accounting, modern languages and geography, and commercial law. It would provide a new degree - the B.Com - in distinction from the traditional alternative of taking economics as part of moral philosophy or history.  In content, it struck a medium between Marshall's heavily theoretical economic tripos at Cambridge and Ashley's theory-free vocational system at Birmingham.   The faculty was expanded with new appointments, and drew students, teachers and funds from the Manchester industrial & commercial community. After Chapman's departure in 1915 for the civil service, economics began to drift at Manchester.  D.H. Macgregor, the new Jevons professor, decamped for Oxford in 1922, to be succeeded by Henry Clay.  Simultaneously, a new Chair in Commerce and Administration was created, filled by a Manchester graduate, George W. Daniels.  In 1927, Clay abandoned the Jevons professorship to Daniels, taking up a Chair in Social Economics instead.  Clay left for the Bank of England in 1930, and was succeeded in the Social Economics chair first by T.E. Gregory and then, in 1936, by John Jewkes. Jewkes, while still a lecturer, had already begun energetically recasting the school.  Among other activities were the upgrading of  the house journal, The Manchester School of Economic and Social Science (founded 1930, renamed 1939) and the creation of the Economic Research Section.  After Daniels premature death in 1938, Jewkes secured John Hicks in 1938 for the Jevons Professorship.  Hicks would finish writing his classic Value and Capital there, his Cobden lectures channeled into his Social Framework (1942).   Two members of the Kiel School - Adolph Lowe and H.C. Hillman - found refuge at Manchester during this time.  Other presences included the young lecturers T.S. Ashton and Hans W. Singer.  With the heavy presence of economic research, the school of commerce was overhauled and renamed the Faculty of Economic and Social Science in 1944. The post-war period was a time of transition.  Hicks left for Oxford in 1946, passing the Jevons professorship to Jewkes, until he too departed two years later.  Lowe left for the New School, Ashton for the LSE and Singer for the United Nations.  Manchester would be reinvented and continue on its own track: in 1948-9, W. Arthur Lewis would become the new Jevons Professor and the chemist and liberal philosopher Michael Polanyi take up the chair in ""social studies"". In 2004, the Victoria University of Manchester (Owens College) merged with the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Manchester Mechanics Institute) to create a single University of Manchester.  Although a new creation, the University of Manchester has used the MMI's 1824 birth-date as its ""official"" foundation date (at least in its logo and advertisements).

LSE," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This site is not related to or endorsed by the London School of Economics or any other organization. See the official L.S.E. website]  The London School of Economics and Political Science (known everywhere by its ""L.S.E."" acronym) was set up as in 1895 by Sidney J. Webb and Beatrice Potter Webb.  In 1900, it became one of the colleges of the University of London system.   The quixotic philosopher Bertrand Russell gave his considerable inheritance to help fund the L.S.E.   Despite being founded by Fabian socialists, its early appointments were more conservative:  W.A.S. Hewins (later a Tory MP) was its first director,  the outspoken and staunchly Neoclassical economist, Edwin Cannan, was to head the economics department, the technocratic Arthur L. Bowley headed statistics and liberal theorists L.T. Hobhouse headed sociology.  However, the Fabian roots of the school were well-represented in the appointments of  more radical scholars such as Graham Wallas, R.H. Tawney, Lord Beveridge, Harold Laski and Hugh Dalton. The L.S.E. from the very beginning aimed at being an academic teaching-and-research powerhouse.  It was one of the group of ""new universities"" founded at the turn of century which eschewed the Oxbridge-Ivy League ""gentlemanly education"" approach in favor of a more serious academic and technical approach, akin to the Central European model.  Like other ""new universities"", the L.S.E. was keen on raising its profile via academic research. They shocked the old Oxbridge system by creating departments that were hitherto unheard of, like anthropology (under Malinowski) and sociology (under Hobhouse), and by splitting economics into separate ""pure economics"" and ""economic history"" components.  In arriviste fashion, the L.S.E encouraged the formation of professional associations and  journals --  in economics alone, the L.S.E. brought forth Economica in 1921 the Economic History Review in 1927 and the Review of Economic Studies in 1933. Edwin Cannan served from 1895 to 1926, after which Allyn A.Young took over.  Young, however, died rather suddenly in 1929 and was succeeded by the thirty-year old Lionel Robbins, a young economist much influenced by the work of Philip H.Wicksteed and the Austrian School of economics.   The remarkable Robbins saw the L.S.E. as an instrument by which to break the orthodox Marshallian hold over English economics. Under Robbins, continental economic theory (Walrasian, Austrian and Swedish) began to finally infiltrate the Anglo-Saxon world. Robbins himself announced the arrival of this ""new"" economics in his famous Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science (1932) expounding the methodology of radical Neoclassical theory.    The Robbins years were glory years for the L.S.E.  It produced a remarkable group of economists, notably John Hicks, Paul Sweezy, Roy G.D. Allen, Abba Lerner, Nicholas Kaldor, George Shackle, Ursula (Webb) Hicks and Tibor Scitovsky in the 1930s, all of whom went on to stretch and change economic theory in a significant manner.  One of their notable efforts was the resurrection of Paretian general equilibrium theory and the forging of the ""New Welfare Economics"" in this period.  Much of this new activity was channeled into the Review of Economic Studies, a publication founded and run by L.S.E. graduate students. One of Robbins' more daring moves was to bring the Austrian economist Friedrich A. Hayek to the L.S.E. in 1932 as the L.S.E's answer to Cambridge's young star, John Maynard Keynes.  Hayek and Keynes locked horns over the theory of macrofluctuations in the early 1930s, and their rivalry placed the L.S.E. clearly on the map.  However, the Keynesian Revolution did much to entice many of the younger members of L.S.E. away from the Robbins-Hayek sphere of influence.  The fault for this ""disloyalty"" lay in good part with the intransigence of their elders: the deserting students, notably Kaldor, Lerner and Shackle, had made numerous attempts to forge the L.S.E. approach with the Keynesian, but Robbins and Hayek refused to entertain such a merger.   Be that as it may, the L.S.E. heritage of these younger economists remained quite visible, even in their subsequent ""Keynesian"" work. In later years, the L.S.E. continued to travel in its distinct path -- albeit it gradually arranged a modus vivendi with the Neo-Keynesian orthodoxy.  Nonetheless, a ""Continental"" flavor maintained itself throughout, as we see in the work of  later L.S.E. economists such as Harry G. Johnson,  Michio Morishima, Frank H. Hahn,  Helen Makower, Hla Myint, W. Arthur Lewis, Peter Bauer and Ronald H. Coase.        The Early (Fabian) Years  The Robbins Circle Later L.S.E. Figures   Resources on the L.S.E.

Mechanics Institutes," Already during the 18th Century Enlightenment, the idea had been flouted to connect industry with science.  Although trade manuals had existed since the very earliest days of publishing, they tended to make little use of scientific theory.   Although many scientific developments emerged as a result of tinkering, communication was limited.  Craftsmen learned their skills directly via apprenticeships with a master, and usually simply replicated that, largely ignorant of developments elsewhere.  Any innovations they came up with were often treated as trade secrets, rarely published, and passed only in person within a tight guild network.  Pure scientists, whether amateur or academic, did publish their theories and findings.  But in an era without public education system,  craftsmen did not usually have sufficient basic background to appreciate them.  As a result, industry and science had tended to proceed on separate grooves.  Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia or an Universal Dictionary of arts and sciences of 1728 and more famously the Encyclop√©die of Diderot and d'Alembert, launched in 1754, had, at least in principle, the goal of bringing the theoretical advances of the scientific revolution to the attention of artisans and manufacturers.  However, these Enlightenment dictionaries, as well as other similar publishing efforts, turned out to be largely unaffordable to the classes they were trying to reach.  The natural next effort in opening up communication came in the form of libraries, whether funded by worker cooperatives or by benevolent well-wishers, to make these volumes accessible. Industrial museums, notably the Conservatoire national des arts et m√©tiers (CNAM), founded in 1794, holding specimens of new machinery, served a similar purpose.  Some of these libraries had the wherewithal to organize occasional public lectures, but they were not sustained, nor were the usually focused on teaching basics or useful skills.  They often consisted of just some lecturer theatrically flogging his latest idea, as a means of self-promotion, and mostly attended by curious middle class audiences, much of it women of leisure. There was little prospect of translating it to any manufacturing process. The advent of the industrial revolution made the matter more urgent.  Machinery spread and grew more complicated just as the labor which used it grew more unskilled.  In between emerged a new class of ""mechanics"", or ""machinists"", skilled working class craftsmen who could understand and repair the machinery.  But improving complex machinery was often beyond them.  In order to tinker successfully, the tinkerer now required some knowledge of the scientific principles behind the machines.  The advent of the ""mechanics institute"" movement of the 1820s Britain was precisely to provide a modern technical education for adult workers. Its primary purpose was to bring machinists, artisans and engineers of the burgeoning industrial revolution in contact with the basic principles and latest research in modern science, principally physics and chemistry, with a view to their practical application to solving problems and improving industrial machinery. The origins of the movement trace back to 1796 when University of Glasgow professor John Anderson, who had routinely conducted public lectures on the practical applications of science, endowed an institution (initially, just a single professor) to continue the effort.    In 1799, Dr. George Birkbeck, a Yorkshire physician trained in the Scottish academies, was appointed the professor at the Andersonian Institute.  The Andersonian lectures were still in the form and reach of previous lecture efforts - that is, for the curious middle classes.  But Birkbeck launched a new direction.  As a physician, Birkbeck frequently worked with craftsmen to make medical instruments. According to legend, some craftsmen having built a centrifugal pump at Birkbeck's directions, asked about how it worked.  Birkbeck gave an impromptu lecture on scientific principles on the spot, and found his audience not only receptive, but captivated.  Energized by the experience, in 1800, Birkbeck persuaded the Andersonian insitute to allow him to launch a special course of lectures dedicated specifically for mechanics.  They were a success, and heavily attended by working class men of Glasgow. Birkbeck left Glasgow in 1804, to set up a medical practice in London. He became involved in the London Institution (f.1805 by Sir Francis Baring), a library of scientific works, which also conducted public lectures, albeit in a general direction.   Back in Glasgow, Birkbeck's dedicated mechanics course at the Andersonian was continued for a while by Andrew Yure, and working class men themselves helped fund the establishment of an associated library.  But the directors of the Andersonian institute preferred to focus on topics of intellectual interest to the middle classes, and gave little or no support to the efforts of the working class mechanics. The first dedicated mechanics institute was launched as the School of Arts in Edinburgh in April 1821 by Leonard Horner (brother of the late Frances Horner).  Horner claimed to have been inspired by stories from Birkbeck in Glasgow at the beginning of the century.  The Edinburgh school was ""for the instruction of mechanics in the branches of physical science as are of practical application in their several trades"".   Its first classes, opening in October, were in chemistry, natural philosophy (mechanics), architecture and farriery, with mathematics added next year, and English, French and drawing shortly after.   The participation of Horner, a minor celebrity, in the Edinburgh School gave it national publicity. Encouraged by Horner, the Glasgow mechanics defected from the Andersonian institute and established their own Glasgow Mechanics Institute in July 1823. That same month, a similar ""Mechanics and Apprentices Library"" (later Institute) was launched in Liverpool.  Still within the year, down in London, George Birkbeck helped support the launch of a new popular science publication, the Mechanics' Magazine, published by J.C. Robertson.  In one of its early issues (Oct 11), Robertson gave notice of the recent institutes in the north and proposed the foundation of a similar institute in London. Birkbeck wrote an immediate reply (Oct 18), recalling his own past experience in the mechanics course at the Andersonian, and threw his weight behind the London scheme. A public meeting was held in November and the London Mechanics Institute was founded in December 1823.  It was supported by a panoply of London luminaries, such as Whig politician Henry Brougham, Radical activist Francis Place, philosopher Jeremy Bentham, classical economist Robert Torrens, Ricardian socialist Thomas Hodgskin, journalist William Cobbett and publisher T.C. Hansard.  In 1824, more mechanics' institutes and libraries were established in Ipswich, Manchester, Newcastle, Leeds, Lancaster, Aberdeen, etc. The fever took hold, and mechanics institutes would multiply and spread to other industrial British towns in the subsequent decade. Although the London Mechanics Institute contained an overrepresentation of Whigs and especially Radicals.  Created around the same time as the repeal of the Combination Acts, and involving the same activists, there was a fusion of outlooks on workers' education and trade unions.  Indeed, under Hodgskin's influence, the LMI would acquire something of a socialistic streak.  It was not wholly unwelcome by Conservatives - Tory politicians like William Huskisson, Frederick J. Robinson and Robert Peel supported the Liverpool and Edinburgh Institutes. But other Tories were more suspicious.  Henry Brougham's 1825 Practical Observations on the Education of the People gave the mechanics institute movement its intellectual defense.

Ireland," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by Trinity College Dublin nor any other organization. See See the official Trinity College Dublin website] Trinity College, in Dublin, was founded 1591 by Queen Elizabeth.  A year later, in 1592, she founded the University of Dublin, designed as a collegiate Anglican university on the same pattern as Oxford and Cambridge.  However, the University of Dublin would never have more than one constituent college - Trinity College Dublin.  As a result, TCD and UD are often spoken of synonymously, although the first is the actual college where teaching is done, the latter is merely the holder of examinations and conveyer of degrees. In 1724, chairs were introduced in natural and experimental philosophy, in 1762 in mathematics and oriental language, in 1776 two chairs in modern languages, in 1785 chemistry and botany, and in 1791 a chair in Gaelic (Irish).

Governance was by a chancellor, vice-chancellor and the senate, conferring degrees. In addition there was the council, a body which represented the board, fellows, professors and the senate. In practice, the university was governed by a small oligarchic board and ""visitors"" (which consisted of the vice-chancellor and the Archbishop of Dublin), required to conducted periodic visitations. board was the center of power, it appointed all academic posts (except the Provost, which was appointed by the crown), controlled the administration and all the executive officers. The (Anglican/Episcopalian Protestant) Church of Ireland established in 1560, and although university fellows were required to be Anglicans, there was no exclusivity on students until 1627, when Charles I took over the charter and instituted religious tests to exclude Dissenters and Catholics from attending. These test were repealed in the Catholic Relief Act of 1793 (although Anglican tests remained for professors and fellows).  After the Irish rebellion of 1798,  the Irish legislative assembly as dissolved and Ireland was integrated with the United Kingdom in the 1801 Act of Union.  Full emancipation of the Catholic population (some three-quarters of Ireland) would have to wait until the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829. The Church of Ireland itself was only disestablished in 1869. Catholics received the Maynooth College in the 1790s. 

1845 Act of parliament establishing three new colleges in Ireland, ""Queen's Colleges"" of Belfast, Cork and Galway.  They were designed as non-denominational, with the intention of allowing Dissenters and Roman Catholics, barred from Anglican Trinity College Dublin, to attend. In 1850, Queen's University in Ireland founded to grant degrees at the three Queen's colleges. To make the non-denominational label stick, the teaching of theology was forbidden at the Queen's Colleges.  The Catholic bishops of Ireland were dissatisfied, and forbade their constituencies from attending the ""godless colleges"", urging instead for the foundation of a proper Catholic university.  The (Catholic) University of Dublin was organized in 1854, depending wholly on popular contributions.  Its first rector was John Henry Newman, the famous future cardinal  Coincidentally, Newman had been Whately's main disciple and protege at Oxford, but the two men had quarreled and broken with each other c.1830. Although they sometimes moved in the same social circles in Dublin, Whately never deigned to speak to Newman again.   The Catholic University was finally formally chartered in 1908, and ninety years later, renamed ""University College Dublin"" in 1998, and incorporated as a constituent college of a  new larger university structure, the National University of Ireland. Whately Chair at Dublin Richard Whately, the leading member of the Oxford School, resigned from his the Drummond chair at Oxford University in late 1831 to take up the appointment as (Episcopalian) Archbishop of Dublin.  Within weeks of his arrival, Whately approached Trinity College with a proposal to fund a Professorship of Political Economy at TCD.  The subject not having been taught before, the proposal was greeted cautiously at first by the denizens of the university (""They thought that it was all a scheme of mine to blow up the University"", Whately later recalled), but finally accepted in January 1832, although the terms of the arrangement were not finalized until March.  The chair was set up on similar terms as the Drummond Professorship: Whately would provide an emolument of ¬£100 per annum, the professor would hold the chair for a fixed five-year term, and have to deliver nine lectures (and publish one) per year.  Candidacy was open to graduates of Trinity, Oxford and Cambridge. Where the Whately chair differed from Drummond was in the process of selection.  Whately was not willing to leave the choice of professor up to the board or convocation of Trinity College, but insisted on having a personal role in selecting the candidates himself.  This provoked resistance from some quarters of the university, but Whately insisted and finally prevailed.  Candidates for the chair would have to undertake an anonymous competitive examination, with questions set and answers reviewed personally by Whately himself, who would select a shortlist to be voted upon by the board, and reserved a final say on their ultimate choice.  This structure would continue until Whately's death in 1863. Nine candidates applied for the first opening in the Summer of 1832, from which Whately selected three to submit to the board.  The choice finally fell on Mountiford Longfield, a lawyer and Trinity graduate, who thus became the first holder of the Whately chair, and the first professor of economics in Ireland.  Trinity College Dublin bred a famous generation of students in the 1840s, including John Kells  Ingram, T.E. Cliffe-Leslie, John Elliot Cairnes and William E. Hearn.   The Dublin Statistical Society was founded on November 23, 1847, with Richard Whately as its first president, and Longfield and Lascom as vice-presidents.  In 1849, the DSS took over the administration of the Barrington Fund, a trust fund established by Dublin merchant John Barrington back in 1834 to fund lectures in political economy for working men in various towns throughout Ireland.

Yale ","    Beginnings First dedicated course of lectures on economics was delivered at William & Mary in 1790s, by James Madison (no, not the US president, but rather James Madison, Bishop of Virginia, president of Wm & Mary).

Up until the latter part of the 19th C., the curriculum of American colleges and universities were still very archaic, geared towards the education of clergymen, dominated by a classical curriculum derivative of the Oxbridge model, where next-to-no modern subjects were taught.  An undergraduate degree consisted primarily of three mandatory years of Classics (Greek and Latin, incl. ancient literature, ancient history, logic, etc.), plus 'Rhetoric' (English grammar and composition, pre-law) and Mathematics (Euclid, trigonometry and later algebra and some physics), with dabs of theology and Biblical studies. There were almost no electives. Only in the final year were senior students given a generic ""moral philosophy"" course, traditionally taught by the college president himself, covering ethics, law and politics, to inculcate finishing students with a general outlook on man and society.  This was designed to ""top off"" the education of gentlemen-students, the future civic and political leaders of the state.  Some economics was often taught as part of this final year course, but it wasn't very deep. The overall purpose was just to inform students what the ""correct"" positions on economic policy every proper gentleman should hold (e.g. laissez faire good, socialism bad). The exact positions indoctrinated depended on the political proclivities of the powers-that-be, that is, the trustees, and it varied from state to state (some free trade, others protectionist; some for hard money, others flexible money). Not that the trustees dictated the content of the final year course, but they would hire college presidents that usually reflected their outlook. Most colleges being clerical training grounds, there was, of course, a very religious tinge from the start - e.g. free markets are God's order, ""invisible hand"" as ""Divine hand"", etc.

There had been many pushes throughout the 19th century to ""modernize"" the curriculum, and introduce modern subjects more systematically, like modern history, geography, modern languages, natural and experimental sciences (geology, chemistry, biology, etc.) and, yes, economics, but it was generally resisted. Would-be reformers pointed to the 'modern' curriculum of the Scottish academies, or the French Grand Ecoles, and especially the German research universities, but most American universities stuck with the Oxbridge curriculum. As a rule, they only hired tutors in Latin, Greek and mathematics. If allowed, modern subjects were often segregated as occasional electives or restricted to graduate courses, so as not to interfere with the main education of undergraduates. The push for reform began early. Thomas Jefferson, who was enamored with the modern French Grand Ecoles, set up West Point and the University of Virginia from scratch, consciously on that model. Jefferson originally envisaged economics as part of a dedicated school of politics, taught by a professor, and fantasized about luring Jean-Baptiste Say to Virginia to fill that chair. But it was nixed, and economics lectures at Virginia were assigned to the professor of law, and when he refused to teach it, to the professor of moral philosophy (George Tucker). Ex-Virginian Thomas Cooper, a chemistry professor, and subsequently president of South Carolina College (future USC), taught the first serious dedicated course on economics at South Carolina during his presidency (1820s). The theologian Rev. Francis Wayland taught it as part of the final year moral philosophy lectures while president of Brown (Rhode Island) in the 1820s-40s, and produced the first American college textbook on the subject as a result. The first professor to be given ""economics"" in his title was Rev. John McVickar, who was hired in 1817 by Columbia as professor of moral philosophy, and ""political economy"" was added to his title in 1826. But he was not a modernist - McVickar was dedicated to the traditional classical curriculum, and taught everything (classics, theology, rhetoric & belles lettres, ethics, history and, yes, economics as part of senior year course).  Harvard introduced their first dedicated economics lectures in 1853, as part of the final year course, and assigned it to the philosopher Francis Bowen (""professor of natural religion, moral philosophy and civil polity""). So the general pattern up until the mid-19th is detectable: college presidents taught it as part of the generic final year course, and in some cases outsourced it to a dedicated senior professor in moral philosophy.

While a few lectures in a final year course may seem sparse, keep in mind that actually American colleges were exposing their undergraduates to more economics than many other countries at the time. English universities, although having dedicated professors of political economy earlier (e.g. 1816 at Cambridge, 1825 at Oxford), kept it apart, lectures went largely unattended (if given at all) and so the average English student was entirely ignorant of it. In France, you'd have to be in the law school to come into contact with it. In Germany economics was found both in the law school and in the ""philosophy"" school (i.e. school of arts), in a special course called ""cameralistics"" (covering public finance, administration, etc.), but German students specialized early, so not everybody took it. In the US, every senior student had to take the final year course, so everyone was exposed to at least some lectures on economics. Nonetheless, the method of instruction was also not deep or flexible. Bulk of the lectures were not really lectures, but just consisted of reading passages out loud from a textbook, often Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, or Francis Wayland's compedium of Ricardian writers. Recitation and rote repetition was still the pedagogic method of choice.  The American ""clerical economists"" loosely adhered to British Ricardian Classicism and its laissez faire tenets (although some were proponents of ""American System"" protectionism).

Reform experiments

Now, it was evident, as the 19th C. advanced, that Oxbridge-based education at American colleges was basically backwards and inadequate. Would-be reformers, who had seen ""modern"" schools in Europe, placed strong pressure to modernize curricula. Local business communities, who often supplied some trustees and hired the graduates, were sympathetic to the reformers, but the clerical-dominated professoriat and administration would have none of it. So reformers joined forces with businessmen to set up ""experiments"" outside.

One of the first such experiments was NYU, established in 1831, on the modern non-denominational model of London's UCL, with backing from the New York finance and merchant community (whose relationship with exlusionist episcopalian Columbia was often toxic). Another was the Rensselaer Institute in Troy, NY, established for engineering and technology in 1835, in imitation of the French ecoles.

A more famous experiment was the University of Wisconsin, established in 1848 by the Wisconsin legislature as part of a state-wide educational system, notionally on the high-minded principle of ""public service"". But it was unclear what that meant exactly, and so its curriculum for years merely followed the only curriculum they were aware of - the Oxbridge model of the Ivy League. A similar problem plagued the University of Michigan, founded a bit earlier, and would plague other state universities founded later.  The Wisconsin experiment revealed an underlying problem with reform: however much State charters talked about wanting to make university education ""useful"" and for ""public service"", the truth of the matter is that a classical education remained the ""entry ticket"" into the American elite. The ambitious sons of Midwestern farmers did not want to learn practical agricultural science, they wanted to get off the farm, learn Greek and Latin, and move up the social ladder. A ""modern"" university which didn't offer the classical route was widely seen as pointless. Still, the reformers kept at it, and deepened their connections with businessmen and especially manufacturers, who were more consciously aware of the need to keep up with recent developments in science (esp. chemistry, physics). They joined in the pressure and pledged private money to fund modern schools. While private money was irresistible, existing university authorities had no intention of letting modern subjects infect their undergraduates.

Both Harvard and Yale relented enough to allow business money to found two modern schools in the 1850s - the ""Lawrence Scientific School"" at Harvard and the ""Sheffield Scientific School"" at Yale. But they kept them strictly segregated from their main colleges. The students were separate, the courses were separate, the degrees separate (B.Phil & Ph.D. from the scientific schools vs. B.A. & M.A. from the main colleges). Most importantly, the funding was separate - Scientific Schools subsisted mainly on student fees and private donations from the business community, and did not draw from the general university fund. In short, the scientific schools were effectively freelance lectures given in New Haven and Cambridge, and had relatively little to do with the main university itself other than borrowing the brand. The scientific schools curriculum was not exclusively technical nor overly specialized. The label ""scientific"" was a generic euphemism for ""modern"". The objective was not to turn out only professional engineers and scientists, but broadly-educated people that went into many professions. The reformers took hold of the scientific schools as a showpiece of how a modern curriculum could work. The clerics at the main college tolerated it so long as it was segregated away.

Scientific schools developed showpiece general courses covering the range of modern subjects mentioned above (natural and experimental sciences, modern history, geography, modern languages, English literature, etc.) Economics was just one part of the ""Select Course"" of Yale's Sheffield School developed by Daniel Coit Gilman in the 1860s. When Gilman's example was ignored, and he was passed over for the Yale presidency, he resigned and headed to California (see below). Gilman's successor at Sheffield in 1872 was Francis Amasa Walker, the dean of American economics, and one of the first persons in the country to hold the title of ""Professor of Political Economy"" exclusively. But, to reiterate, that had nothing to do with Yale itself. Yale president T.D. Woolsey still lectured the final year course at Yale college until 1871, then William Graham Sumner (a Biblical scholar and professor of Greek & ancient History) took over the economics lecturing and made it is own. Through the 1870s, Sumner did the economics lectures at Yale College, while Walker taught in the Sheffield ghetto. Different schools, different students, the two had nothing to do with each other.

Columbia did not enter the ""scientific school"" game, but it actually went further in 1857 with the introduction of an ""elective year"", where senior students could choose to forego classics in favor of either science or jurisprudence. Economics and history was to be included under the latter, and Columbia brought in Francis Lieber that same year for the purpose. German-born Lieber was an economics enthusiast, and had been Cooper's successor at South Carolina. Lieber came to Columbia as professor of History and Political Science, taking over the economics courses away from moral philosopher McVickar. Lieber tried to expand the economics course, making it more frequent, but things ended flat. The 1857 reforms were reversed, the elective year abolished by 1861, and Lieber himself removed in 1865 by incoming president Barnard. Everything went back to how it was before, with economics falling under the final year moral philosophy course, now assigned to moral philosopher Charles Nairne (who didn't much care for economics, and primarily taught English literature, Rhetoric, etc.)

Morrill Act

A great watershed was the Morrill Act of 1862, when the US government assigned federal money (more specifically, grants of federal land, which could be sold for cash) for the establishment of schools for ""agricultural and mechanical arts"".  Specifically the maintenance of ""at least one college where the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanical arts, in such a manner as the legislature of the States may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions of life.""  There was no exact formula on what that meant. Congress's notional idea was to improve American industry and agriculture by putting farmers and machinists in touch with modern scientific principles. But it did not have to be narrowly technical - the Morrill act specifically noted that classics and other fields did not have to be excluded. Some reformers saw this as an opportunity to design an entire university from scratch, without any constraints. But they would be disappointed.

How the Morrill money was used varied by state. The Morrill act specified 30,000 acres of federal land per senator or congressman, so more populous states got more money. But proposals had to be submitted within five years. Many states used them to erect public universities (e.g. University of California in 1868). Others created new appendages (e.g. the College of Agriculture at Wisconsin). Massachusetts split its money - 70% went to found a Massachusetts Agricultural College in Amherst (future UMass), while 30% went to fund a new polytechnical school (M.I.T.). New York State originally toyed splitting the money, but eventually (persuaded by reformist A.D. White) put it all into raising one new university - Cornell University in 1865.

The curriculum of the new universities was still very unsettled. For many new universities, not knowing better, the formula used was still the traditional classical one, where economics only popped in as part of the final senior year. The new Morrill-created state universities looked to the older state universities (Wisconsin, Michigan) for tips, and that is still how it was done. Through the 1860s and 1870s, economics was taught at Wisconsin by the president John Bascom as part of ""mental and moral philosophy"", while at Michigan, economics was taught by president James B. Angell in a final year together with international law (semesters alternated).

Morrill-created  University of California (Berkeley) got a little more complicated because California state politics got very heavily involved. In the original stages, designed by the State's elites, California followed the classical model simply because they did not know better. But in 1872, they hired Gilman from Yale's Sheffield school as California president. Gilman finally thought he had the opportunity to design his ideal modern university from scratch (much like his reformer friend A.D. White did with Cornell). But then the political winds changed, and coalitions of farmers and artisans pushed the legislature and demanded that the university jettison all the non-practical courses and become an exclusively ""agricultural-and-mechanics"" school. They imposed a State-appointed Board of Regents on the university, and Gilman resigned. Things in California continued in uncertain state for years thereafter. Future agrarian socialist leader, Henry George (then an newspaper editor in San Francisco, who had led the charge against the elitist design) would soon put in a bid as professor of political economy (in preparing his candidacy, George wrote up the notes that would become Progress and Poverty).

The new narrow technical colleges, like M.I.T., fate was a little different. There was pressure, for quite some time, that MIT should be merged with Harvard's Lawrence School, and become the science and engineering branch of Harvard. This was resisted by MIT's president and faculty. But that meant they had to come up with a wider set of courses on their own, and give their own students a background in the humanities and social sciences. (The underlying notion was that churning out engineers was not enough; the engineers were supposed to be hired by the private sector, and move up the career ladders which would eventually place them in management and upper level positions where they would need more than just their technical skills.) So MIT actually hired one person (William Parsons Atkinson) to do all the non-science teaching for many years. Atkinson did not do classics, but essentially modern history, modern languages, English literature, ethics, law, politics and yes a dab of economics. These were all lumped together in what was called ""Course IX"" (still the common nickname for decades). Originally obligatory for all MIT students, Course IX later became optional and the only non-science specialization at MIT for a long time.

In sum, up until the 1870s, despite the experiments and the Morrill act, little had actually changed. Although there were now some special schools with modern curricula, the main colleges were still married to their classical curriculum. Classics dominated, and the only economics was delivered by presidents (or their moral philosophy proxies) in the generic final year course, and that was it. Many of the new state universities created by the Morrill Act merely replicated that formula, or remained in a state of flux.

It is only in the 1870s that things began to really change. And even then, only slowly.

1870s Changes

The main influence for change in the 1870s was three factors.

(1) Firstly, that undergraduate students were now older - whereas previous to the Civil War, they had enrolled in college at fifteen or so, they now began to enroll later, and thus the pedagogic value of the classical education, with its mental and moral training for teenagers, were no longer seen as vital for 18- and 19-year-old adults. University authorities gradually began to recognize that specialization in electives was more useful for their futures than a tour-de-force of ancient classics.

(2) Secondly, the enrollment of women in coeducational land grant and other colleges broadened the student base. A narrow mandatory classical education seemed less appropriate for young women. Moreover, the influx demanded more courses and more teachers, which afforded the opportunity to create more elective courses (Michigan, Cornell and Boston went co-ed by 1879; Berkeley co-ed by 1870)

(3) Thirdly, the arrival of the ""new generation"" of American scholars, who had gone for graduate training in Germany, and came home looking for positions. German-trained Americans began as a trickle in the early 1870s, but turned into a flood by the 1880s. Again, American universities were only hiring tutors in Greek, Latin and mathematics, even in the new Morrill colleges. The new generation of teachers put pressure for change.

The leading reformers of the 1870s had done earlier tours of Europe and were eager to introduce the modern German education model into the US. Now older and nearer positions of power, many ascended into university president positions and made common cause with the new generation. The leading names are well known - presidents Daniel Coit Gilman (Hopkins), Andrew Dickson White (Cornell), Charles W. Eliot (Harvard), etc.

Some pinned their hopes on change from within, others in the blank slate opportunities offered by the Morrill Act. When these proved too resistant, they turned to the Gilded Age tycoons - Vanderbilts, Carnegies, Rockefellers, etc. to make new homes for them.

Andrew Dickson White showed the way by roping in Ezra Cornell's Western Union fortune and New York State's Morrill money into creating Cornell University back in 1865. It took a while to get economics organized. Cornell initially started with a moral philosopher (William Dexter Wilson) delivering the economics dose in the fourth year, before White finally got around to hiring their first economist (Henry Carter Adams) in 1879. Adams is notable for being the first Ph.D. in economics to come out of Johns Hopkins.

The Johns Hopkins University, founded 1876 with B&O railroad money, was the brainchild of ex-Sheffielder Daniel Coit Gilman, after his ignoble evacuation from Berkeley. Hopkins was the first German-model research university, with advanced undergraduate and graduate degrees. At Hopkins, economics was still together with history in a joint ""Department of Moral and Historical Sciences"" for many years. (This was not a mere relic - the ""Historicist School"" of German economics, in which the new generation was trained, saw economics, politics and history as integral; the leading Hopkins teachers - economist Richard T. Ely and historian Herbert Baxter Adams - worked together like two gloves.).

While Hopkins could be just have become another experiment, and prospectively meet a similar ignoble fate as the scientific schools, Hopkins changed the dynamics by quickly pumping out a generation of well-trained American economists, ready to be hired in colleges across the country. At a time when new Morrill colleges were finding their footing and trying to grow, or existing colleges looking to add courses to meet the influx, a ""reserve army"" of Hopkins graduates were ready and available.

As mentioned, Hopkins granted its first Ph.D. in economics in 1878 to Henry Carter Adams. But Hopkins had been pipped to the punch by Harvard, which gave its first Ph.D. for an economics topic in 1875 (to Stuart Wood). Indeed, Harvard had spearheaded the reform period of the 1870s with the appointment of MIT chemistry professor Charles W. Eliot as Harvard's new president in 1869. Eliot transferred the modernization lessons of fledgling MIT to Harvard. Eliot took economics away from the wide-ranging moral philosopher Bowen, and appointed Harvard's first dedicated professor of economics, Charles Dunbar, in 1871. Eliot went on to hire a couple more economists a few years later as Dunbar's assistants (Silas MacVane, J. Laurence Laughlin).

The emergence of Johns Hopkins proved fatal for Yale's Sheffield School. Through the 1870s, Francis A. Walker (at Sheffield) and W. G. Sumner (at Yale College) had been dueling for the economics crown in New Haven. Initially, economics was supposed to be contained in Walker's Sheffield ghetto. But W.G. Sumner changed that. Despite his traditionalist background, Sumner turned out to be an economics enthusiast and reformist gnat and pushed the Yale administration into expanding the scope of economics and social sciences at Yale College. He even got a couple of German-trained assistants by the late 1870s (H.W. Farnam and A.T. Hadley - even though they originally hired as Greek & Latin tutors, they were soon teaching ""optional"" courses on economic topics). This took away some of the specialness of Walker's Sheffield. Nonetheless, Walker continued to fight for resources and harbored the fantasy of turning Sheffield into the country's foremost school of economics. Looking beyond New Haven, Walker wanted Sheffield to be where people across the US, interested in a civil service career, or involved in social reform movements, or high school and college teachers wanting to improve their own teaching, could come for special training. The emergence of Johns Hopkins in the late 1870s, fulfilling precisely that role and mopping up all such students, killed that dream. Walker quit Sheffield in 1880, and went on to become president of MIT (after Walker, Sheffield's scope declined and it since became a merely Yale's school of engineering; economics, under Sumner, become firmly established in Yale college).

Although the first Columbia experiment back in 1857 had failed, it was ready to try again by the late 1870s. Columbia president F.A. Barnard changed his mind, and joined forces with a young ""new generation"" history professor John Burgess to launch a ""School of Political Science"" in 1880. In Burgess's scheme, it was to be a French Grande Ecole-style school for the training of civil servants (Burgess's proposal basically translated the curriculum of SciencesPo in Paris). Its curriculum covered economics, history, international law and the like. It was not as firmly segregated as the old scientific schools had been - Columbia college students could enter SPS after completing three years of classics (but they would go on to receive a B.Phil rather than B.A.). Burgess introduced a German-style seminar and Ph.D. for post-graduates. German-trained Richmond Mayo-Smith was the first economist appointed to Columbia, and raised to ""professor of political economy"" in 1887, when more economists (e.g. Seligman) were brought in. Columbia's SPS was a success and soon would rival Hopkins and arguably surpass it in prominence and production of graduates by the end of the century.

The University of Michigan followed closely. President Angell had reluctantly divested himself of economics in 1880, and passed it over to H.C. Adams (who now split his semesters between Michigan and Cornell), and made a couple other social science and history appointments (T.M. Cooley, C.K. Adams). During Angell's absence on a mission to China in 1880-81, Michigan established a ""School of Political Science"" on Columbia's model.

The University of Pennsylvania tapped gilded age fortunes to create the Wharton School that same year (1880), not for civil servants per se, but for the training of business and political leaders. Penn's history in economics is actually a little interesting, since it was the most overtly political. Never quite a domineered clerical bastion like the older Ivy Leagues, Penn's trustees included many notable Philadelphia industrialists, and they were adamant about having their views on economic policy (notably American System protectionism) delivered to the students. They ejected Penn president Henry Vethake in 1860, who had been delivering economics as part of the final year course for a while, for not being protectionist enough, and in 1870 introduced a new required social sciences course (and from 1874 a dedicated professor of social sciences, Ralph Ellis Thompson), with readings coming exclusively out of Henry Carey's textbook. Industrialist Joseph Wharton (a Carey disciple) wanted to reinforce that mission. The creation of the Wharton School in 1880 gave the funds for the hiring of a new slate of German-trained ""new generation"" economists (E.J.James, S.N. Patten) through Wharton who crossed over with the main Penn college and took over Thompson's social sciences load. The rise of a new provost, William Pepper, an enthusiast of the German model, in 1881, reinforced that direction. 1880s & after

Economics at the beginning of the 1870s had been practically non-existent and teaching limited to the president (or his proxy) in a final year. A decade later, by the beginning of the 1880s, economics professors began being appointed and a slate of elective courses on a variety of economics topics began popping up on the menu in many schools. It was still not exclusively economics - it was usually married with modern history and politics under political science or social sciences generally. But by the late 1880s it was already being pushed in the direction of further specialization.

The new generation of German-trained Americans were the principal spirits behind the reform push in the 1880s, towards the German model in American universities. In places like Hopkins, the German seminar model was introduced, and students had to present a research theses to graduate. But the seminar model did not take hold everywhere, or became limited to a graduate school thing (e.g. Columbia). Nonetheless, there were significant changes at the undergraduate level, the old Oxbridge method of tutoring, strict reading and recitation fell away, replaced by more open-ended lectures and written exams, which continues to characterize American colleges today.

The new generation brought not only German-style education, but also German-style economics to American shores - specifically, the German Historical School. With it came a suspicion of economic theory and an attachment to empiricism and historicism. In the 1880s, feisty new generation economists broke into Methodenstreit fights with the old guard in the pages of contemporary American magazines and reviews.

The new generation also carried German policy ideas about the role of the state. They were suspicious of laissez faire, and saw the mission of economics in the service of social reform, which fed into the growing progressive movement, sometimes spilled over into outright socialism. Many of the new professors of economics styled themselves public intellectuals, wrote about social sciences and policy generally, and spoke openly in the local and national press about hot topics which sometimes landed them in hot water with still-clerical administrators and conservative university trustees.

As the Gilded Age advanced, there were still more universities created out of the industrialist fortunes. 

Stanford University (f.1884) tapped into the Central Pacific fortune of railroad tycoon Leland Stanford, as a vanity project of Stanford himself, after he was rejected by the political-dominated Board of Regents of the University of California. He had no idea what he wanted to do with it, but hired a president David Starr Jordan who had very much the Hopkins model in mind, and stocked it with Hopkins graduates. Economics was envisaged from the start as part of political science and sociology. But Stanford had immense growing pains - particularly over the issue of salaries and academic freedom. Dominated by Jane Stanford (the widow of Leland), who insisted on hiring and firing professors at will, Stanford was unable to hold on to faculty for long and became a revolving door with a poor reputation that took many decades to overcome. So Stanford is not really a factor at this stage, other than a temporary staging post in the careers of many economists.

The University of Chicago (f.1892) took Standard Oil money of John D. Rockefeller. Unlike Stanford, Rockefeller gave Chicago president William Rainey Harper virtual carte blanche. And Harper used it to build the first exclusive economics department in the country, unattached to any other division. Harper raided Cornell and other universities for faculty. Its first economics professor, J. Laurence Laughlin became a sort of the ""King Arthur"" of Chicago economics - a semi-mythical founder of Chicago's combative conservatism, and presided for nearly three decades over a round-table of varied young knights that came and went. Unlike Stanford, Chicago became a factor almost immediately.

The creation of Chicago threatened Wisconsin's bid as the premier Midwestern university (Michigan aside), and prompted Wisconsin to finally get its act together. President Bascom had been run out by the trustees in 1887 for his excessive progressive moral crusading. The new president T.C. Chamberlin had an affectation for German model, but also the original Wisconsin ""public service"" mission in mind. He began implementing both immediately - introducing extension lectures on practical topics for the Wisconsin public, promoting greater interaction between the College of Agriculture and practicing farmers, while at the same time introducing more Germanic research-orientated graduate programs for the Wisconsin students. But, as mentioned, the creation of Chicago proved a threat, and Chamberlin hurriedly founded the ""School of Economics, Political Science and History"" in 1892 (arguing the French civil service angle) and succeeded in roping in the dean of the new generation, Richard T. Ely (then unhappy at Hopkins) to head it. Ely arrived with a coterie of junior faculty and advanced students from Hopkins. Wisconsin's rise as a bastion of Institutionalist economics begins here. Associations

Professionalization and specialization quickly followed, and by the late 1880s had taken wing.

It is unsurprising that the first professional associations - the AEA (f.1886) and the AAPSS (f.1889) - came out of the most German of schools, Johns Hopkins and Penn respectively. But associations had started earlier and had growing pains of their own.  The earliest American association in the social sciences (generally speaking) was the American Statistical Association (f. 1839). It had been founded on the model of the British SSL, where social science researchers (mostly amateurs and social reformers) could meet and present empirical data on social stuff they had collected to each other.  In a similar spirit, the American Social Science Association (ASSA) had been founded in 1865 by a group of charities in Boston, and was modeled on the British NAPSS. This came in response to mass immigration and rapid urbanization of the 1850s which had brought up a series of social problems in many eastern cities. The ASSA was not an academic organization, but a social reform organization. Its intent was to bring together educated people of various backgrounds (activists, academics, clerics, charity workers, businessmen, politicians, etc.) in contact with each other, to present their findings, and coordinate with each other on legislative proposals (on public health, sanitation, education, urban planning, police and penal system, trade unions, etc.). The ASSA was never really effective as a national organization, given that most such reforms were the prerogative of municipal and state legislatures, rather than national. So some local chapters of the ASSA were better organized and more active than others.

The big thing of the ASSA was its annual national conference, where people from all over the country met. In the 1880s, as social scientists were finally setting themselves up in universities as professional academics, it quickly dawned that this was a unique opportunity for holding parallel conferences on more exclusively academic topics they were researching. The Johns Hopkins academics were the first to part ways and use the annual ASSA meeting to set up exclusive sessions for themselves, without the confusing hoi polloi of amateurs. The historians, under Herbert Baxter Adams, defected first, founding the American Historical Association (AHA) in 1884. This was followed up by the economists, under Richard T. Ely, who founded the American Economic Association (AEA) in 1886. These moves had encouraged by Hopkins president Gilman as a way to raise Hopkins's national profile.

But the idea for the AEA was actually older. The Penn economists, besides being all German-trained and faithfully protectionist, were also the first to come up with the idea of putting economics in the service of economic and social reform, along the lines of the German Verein fur Socialpoliitk. While still students in Halle, Germany, James and Patten had drafted the first scheme for an equivalent American association, to fight the influence of ""British"" economics (with its attachment to laissez faire and free trade), and embrace a more ""German"" economics (more protectionist, with an interventionist state). But Ely pipped them to the punch, and established the AEA in 1886 with a manifesto articulating the similar Verein-like principles and goals.

The Penn economists (James, Patten) actually protested the creation of the AEA. They disliked the professional character of the AEA and the segregation of economics from the other social sciences. They urged economists should stay under the ""Economics"" and ""Finance"" sections of the ASSA meetings as the best avenue to fulfill its social reform function. They saw the AHA & AEA defections as a Hopkins-engineered gambit to take over. As the ASSA was impotent to prevent it, and hobbled as a result, the Penn guys decided to strike out on their own and founded their own association, more in line with the original open ASSA spirit. The Philadelphia branch of the ASSA  was one of the more active branches anyway, so it was not too hard to elevate that branch into a new American Academy of Political and Social Science (AAPSS, f.1889). Despite its national monicker, the activities of the AAPSS were primarily coordinated between Pennsylvania schools (Penn, Bryn Mawr, Swarthmore, etc.)

Conservative economists did not like the German historicist and socialist spirit of Ely's AEA, and had already founded their own small exclusive private ""Political Economy Club"" in 1883 (main spirit was J. Laurence Laughlin, then at Harvard, and Hopkins's Simon Newcomb), modeled on the similar London dining-discussion club. The AEA and the PE Club threw muck at each other for a little while, but it was clear the AEA, with its more open membership and more professional character had the upper hand, and the PE Club dissipated. Laughlin refused to join the AEA and chided former members, like Harvard's Taussig, from breaking ranks and doing so.

The main move for the ""acceptability"" of the AEA was ejection of Ely in 1892 for too much radicalism. After Ely's departure, the AEA took decisive moves to become a more broad-based, more academic, more professional, and less polemical, and neutral on policy.

Ely's ""loss of control"" of the AEA was not taken kindly his fellow travelers, and provoked a new split in 1895: the creation of the ""Political Science Association"" (PSA). The name was deceptive. It was an economics association, chock-full of bona fide economists - mainly Institutionalist economists from the Midwest, who had been former colleagues and students of Ely (notably HC Adams at Michigan and John Commons, then at Indiana; Ely himself had moved to Wisconsin in 1892). Disappointed by the neutral turn of the AEA, the PSA explicitly ""restored"" the original political and social reform goals of the original AEA. Although the PSA diplomatically assured the AEA that it was not a rival organization, but merely a regional one, limited to the Midwest, it was nonetheless perceived as a threat. The PSA charged that the AEA was dominated by eastern economists, that meetings were always east of the Alleghenies, negligent of the needs and struggles of Midwestern states, and the pressure which Midwestern economists were under in their universities (this was the height of agrarian socialism and the Bryan campaign, where Midwestern economists being asked to pick sides). The threat of schism prompted the AEA to hold joint meetings with the PSA in Indianapolis (Commons's base) in 1895 and elected HC Adams as president to mollify the midwesterners. The PSA lingered on as a regional organization, but its schismatic character dissipated when Ely was unexpectedly elected president of the AEA in 1899, healing some of the old rifts.

[Note: the second PSA - the modern APSA - was created in the early 1900s, not for ideological or regional reasons, but rather professional reasons; as further specialization in the late 1890s and early 1900s finally separated economics from sociology from political science, and professors in the latter wanted their own professional association. With the academics all gone into their own associations, the ASSA was hallowed out, and basically wound up by 1909.]

Publications

Early American economists tended to publish sparingly but widely, in general-interest reviews, like the Atlantic Monthly, Harper's, the New Englander, the Princeton Review, North American Review, etc. The closest thing to an economics journal in the 1870s was the curious International Review, a review of history and social sciences, edited by the president of Lehigh University.

But beginning in the mid-1880s, a slate of new dedicated economics publications were launched to advertise the research of the new departments and associations. Again, this was very similar to the model in German universities. The Hopkins folks blazed the way with launching the The Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science in 1882, properly speaking a periodically-published paper series rather than a journal. 1886 was a banner year: it saw the launch of Harvard's Quarterly Journal of Economics and Columbia's Political Science Quarterly and also the Publications of the AEA (half-paper series, half-journal that would drag out to 1911, when firmly journal AER was founded). The Penn guys launched the Annals of the AAPSS in 1891, Chicago responded with the Journal of Political Economy in 1892, while Yale social scientists took over the Yale Review in 1892 and made it effectively their house organ. Further afield, Michigan launched the Publications of the Michigan Political Science Association in 1893.

American Universities,"    Beginnings First dedicated course of lectures on economics was delivered at William & Mary in 1790s, by James Madison (no, not the US president, but rather James Madison, Bishop of Virginia, president of Wm & Mary).

Up until the latter part of the 19th C., the curriculum of American colleges and universities were still very archaic, geared towards the education of clergymen, dominated by a classical curriculum derivative of the Oxbridge model, where next-to-no modern subjects were taught.  An undergraduate degree consisted primarily of three mandatory years of Classics (Greek and Latin, incl. ancient literature, ancient history, logic, etc.), plus 'Rhetoric' (English grammar and composition, pre-law) and Mathematics (Euclid, trigonometry and later algebra and some physics), with dabs of theology and Biblical studies. There were almost no electives. Only in the final year were senior students given a generic ""moral philosophy"" course, traditionally taught by the college president himself, covering ethics, law and politics, to inculcate finishing students with a general outlook on man and society.  This was designed to ""top off"" the education of gentlemen-students, the future civic and political leaders of the state.  Some economics was often taught as part of this final year course, but it wasn't very deep. The overall purpose was just to inform students what the ""correct"" positions on economic policy every proper gentleman should hold (e.g. laissez faire good, socialism bad). The exact positions indoctrinated depended on the political proclivities of the powers-that-be, that is, the trustees, and it varied from state to state (some free trade, others protectionist; some for hard money, others flexible money). Not that the trustees dictated the content of the final year course, but they would hire college presidents that usually reflected their outlook. Most colleges being clerical training grounds, there was, of course, a very religious tinge from the start - e.g. free markets are God's order, ""invisible hand"" as ""Divine hand"", etc.

There had been many pushes throughout the 19th century to ""modernize"" the curriculum, and introduce modern subjects more systematically, like modern history, geography, modern languages, natural and experimental sciences (geology, chemistry, biology, etc.) and, yes, economics, but it was generally resisted. Would-be reformers pointed to the 'modern' curriculum of the Scottish academies, or the French Grand Ecoles, and especially the German research universities, but most American universities stuck with the Oxbridge curriculum. As a rule, they only hired tutors in Latin, Greek and mathematics. If allowed, modern subjects were often segregated as occasional electives or restricted to graduate courses, so as not to interfere with the main education of undergraduates. The push for reform began early. Thomas Jefferson, who was enamored with the modern French Grand Ecoles, set up West Point and the University of Virginia from scratch, consciously on that model. Jefferson originally envisaged economics as part of a dedicated school of politics, taught by a professor, and fantasized about luring Jean-Baptiste Say to Virginia to fill that chair. But it was nixed, and economics lectures at Virginia were assigned to the professor of law, and when he refused to teach it, to the professor of moral philosophy (George Tucker). Ex-Virginian Thomas Cooper, a chemistry professor, and subsequently president of South Carolina College (future USC), taught the first serious dedicated course on economics at South Carolina during his presidency (1820s). The theologian Rev. Francis Wayland taught it as part of the final year moral philosophy lectures while president of Brown (Rhode Island) in the 1820s-40s, and produced the first American college textbook on the subject as a result. The first professor to be given ""economics"" in his title was Rev. John McVickar, who was hired in 1817 by Columbia as professor of moral philosophy, and ""political economy"" was added to his title in 1826. But he was not a modernist - McVickar was dedicated to the traditional classical curriculum, and taught everything (classics, theology, rhetoric & belles lettres, ethics, history and, yes, economics as part of senior year course).  Harvard introduced their first dedicated economics lectures in 1853, as part of the final year course, and assigned it to the philosopher Francis Bowen (""professor of natural religion, moral philosophy and civil polity""). So the general pattern up until the mid-19th is detectable: college presidents taught it as part of the generic final year course, and in some cases outsourced it to a dedicated senior professor in moral philosophy.

While a few lectures in a final year course may seem sparse, keep in mind that actually American colleges were exposing their undergraduates to more economics than many other countries at the time. English universities, although having dedicated professors of political economy earlier (e.g. 1816 at Cambridge, 1825 at Oxford), kept it apart, lectures went largely unattended (if given at all) and so the average English student was entirely ignorant of it. In France, you'd have to be in the law school to come into contact with it. In Germany economics was found both in the law school and in the ""philosophy"" school (i.e. school of arts), in a special course called ""cameralistics"" (covering public finance, administration, etc.), but German students specialized early, so not everybody took it. In the US, every senior student had to take the final year course, so everyone was exposed to at least some lectures on economics. Nonetheless, the method of instruction was also not deep or flexible. Bulk of the lectures were not really lectures, but just consisted of reading passages out loud from a textbook, often Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, or Francis Wayland's compedium of Ricardian writers. Recitation and rote repetition was still the pedagogic method of choice.  The American ""clerical economists"" loosely adhered to British Ricardian Classicism and its laissez faire tenets (although some were proponents of ""American System"" protectionism).

Reform experiments

Now, it was evident, as the 19th C. advanced, that Oxbridge-based education at American colleges was basically backwards and inadequate. Would-be reformers, who had seen ""modern"" schools in Europe, placed strong pressure to modernize curricula. Local business communities, who often supplied some trustees and hired the graduates, were sympathetic to the reformers, but the clerical-dominated professoriat and administration would have none of it. So reformers joined forces with businessmen to set up ""experiments"" outside.

One of the first such experiments was NYU, established in 1831, on the modern non-denominational model of London's UCL, with backing from the New York finance and merchant community (whose relationship with exlusionist episcopalian Columbia was often toxic). Another was the Rensselaer Institute in Troy, NY, established for engineering and technology in 1835, in imitation of the French ecoles.

A more famous experiment was the University of Wisconsin, established in 1848 by the Wisconsin legislature as part of a state-wide educational system, notionally on the high-minded principle of ""public service"". But it was unclear what that meant exactly, and so its curriculum for years merely followed the only curriculum they were aware of - the Oxbridge model of the Ivy League. A similar problem plagued the University of Michigan, founded a bit earlier, and would plague other state universities founded later.  The Wisconsin experiment revealed an underlying problem with reform: however much State charters talked about wanting to make university education ""useful"" and for ""public service"", the truth of the matter is that a classical education remained the ""entry ticket"" into the American elite. The ambitious sons of Midwestern farmers did not want to learn practical agricultural science, they wanted to get off the farm, learn Greek and Latin, and move up the social ladder. A ""modern"" university which didn't offer the classical route was widely seen as pointless. Still, the reformers kept at it, and deepened their connections with businessmen and especially manufacturers, who were more consciously aware of the need to keep up with recent developments in science (esp. chemistry, physics). They joined in the pressure and pledged private money to fund modern schools. While private money was irresistible, existing university authorities had no intention of letting modern subjects infect their undergraduates.

Both Harvard and Yale relented enough to allow business money to found two modern schools in the 1850s - the ""Lawrence Scientific School"" at Harvard and the ""Sheffield Scientific School"" at Yale. But they kept them strictly segregated from their main colleges. The students were separate, the courses were separate, the degrees separate (B.Phil & Ph.D. from the scientific schools vs. B.A. & M.A. from the main colleges). Most importantly, the funding was separate - Scientific Schools subsisted mainly on student fees and private donations from the business community, and did not draw from the general university fund. In short, the scientific schools were effectively freelance lectures given in New Haven and Cambridge, and had relatively little to do with the main university itself other than borrowing the brand. The scientific schools curriculum was not exclusively technical nor overly specialized. The label ""scientific"" was a generic euphemism for ""modern"". The objective was not to turn out only professional engineers and scientists, but broadly-educated people that went into many professions. The reformers took hold of the scientific schools as a showpiece of how a modern curriculum could work. The clerics at the main college tolerated it so long as it was segregated away.

Scientific schools developed showpiece general courses covering the range of modern subjects mentioned above (natural and experimental sciences, modern history, geography, modern languages, English literature, etc.) Economics was just one part of the ""Select Course"" of Yale's Sheffield School developed by Daniel Coit Gilman in the 1860s. When Gilman's example was ignored, and he was passed over for the Yale presidency, he resigned and headed to California (see below). Gilman's successor at Sheffield in 1872 was Francis Amasa Walker, the dean of American economics, and one of the first persons in the country to hold the title of ""Professor of Political Economy"" exclusively. But, to reiterate, that had nothing to do with Yale itself. Yale president T.D. Woolsey still lectured the final year course at Yale college until 1871, then William Graham Sumner (a Biblical scholar and professor of Greek & ancient History) took over the economics lecturing and made it is own. Through the 1870s, Sumner did the economics lectures at Yale College, while Walker taught in the Sheffield ghetto. Different schools, different students, the two had nothing to do with each other.

Columbia did not enter the ""scientific school"" game, but it actually went further in 1857 with the introduction of an ""elective year"", where senior students could choose to forego classics in favor of either science or jurisprudence. Economics and history was to be included under the latter, and Columbia brought in Francis Lieber that same year for the purpose. German-born Lieber was an economics enthusiast, and had been Cooper's successor at South Carolina. Lieber came to Columbia as professor of History and Political Science, taking over the economics courses away from moral philosopher McVickar. Lieber tried to expand the economics course, making it more frequent, but things ended flat. The 1857 reforms were reversed, the elective year abolished by 1861, and Lieber himself removed in 1865 by incoming president Barnard. Everything went back to how it was before, with economics falling under the final year moral philosophy course, now assigned to moral philosopher Charles Nairne (who didn't much care for economics, and primarily taught English literature, Rhetoric, etc.)

Morrill Act

A great watershed was the Morrill Act of 1862, when the US government assigned federal money (more specifically, grants of federal land, which could be sold for cash) for the establishment of schools for ""agricultural and mechanical arts"".  Specifically the maintenance of ""at least one college where the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanical arts, in such a manner as the legislature of the States may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions of life.""  There was no exact formula on what that meant. Congress's notional idea was to improve American industry and agriculture by putting farmers and machinists in touch with modern scientific principles. But it did not have to be narrowly technical - the Morrill act specifically noted that classics and other fields did not have to be excluded. Some reformers saw this as an opportunity to design an entire university from scratch, without any constraints. But they would be disappointed.

How the Morrill money was used varied by state. The Morrill act specified 30,000 acres of federal land per senator or congressman, so more populous states got more money. But proposals had to be submitted within five years. Many states used them to erect public universities (e.g. University of California in 1868). Others created new appendages (e.g. the College of Agriculture at Wisconsin). Massachusetts split its money - 70% went to found a Massachusetts Agricultural College in Amherst (future UMass), while 30% went to fund a new polytechnical school (M.I.T.). New York State originally toyed splitting the money, but eventually (persuaded by reformist A.D. White) put it all into raising one new university - Cornell University in 1865.

The curriculum of the new universities was still very unsettled. For many new universities, not knowing better, the formula used was still the traditional classical one, where economics only popped in as part of the final senior year. The new Morrill-created state universities looked to the older state universities (Wisconsin, Michigan) for tips, and that is still how it was done. Through the 1860s and 1870s, economics was taught at Wisconsin by the president John Bascom as part of ""mental and moral philosophy"", while at Michigan, economics was taught by president James B. Angell in a final year together with international law (semesters alternated).

Morrill-created  University of California (Berkeley) got a little more complicated because California state politics got very heavily involved. In the original stages, designed by the State's elites, California followed the classical model simply because they did not know better. But in 1872, they hired Gilman from Yale's Sheffield school as California president. Gilman finally thought he had the opportunity to design his ideal modern university from scratch (much like his reformer friend A.D. White did with Cornell). But then the political winds changed, and coalitions of farmers and artisans pushed the legislature and demanded that the university jettison all the non-practical courses and become an exclusively ""agricultural-and-mechanics"" school. They imposed a State-appointed Board of Regents on the university, and Gilman resigned. Things in California continued in uncertain state for years thereafter. Future agrarian socialist leader, Henry George (then an newspaper editor in San Francisco, who had led the charge against the elitist design) would soon put in a bid as professor of political economy (in preparing his candidacy, George wrote up the notes that would become Progress and Poverty).

The new narrow technical colleges, like M.I.T., fate was a little different. There was pressure, for quite some time, that MIT should be merged with Harvard's Lawrence School, and become the science and engineering branch of Harvard. This was resisted by MIT's president and faculty. But that meant they had to come up with a wider set of courses on their own, and give their own students a background in the humanities and social sciences. (The underlying notion was that churning out engineers was not enough; the engineers were supposed to be hired by the private sector, and move up the career ladders which would eventually place them in management and upper level positions where they would need more than just their technical skills.) So MIT actually hired one person (William Parsons Atkinson) to do all the non-science teaching for many years. Atkinson did not do classics, but essentially modern history, modern languages, English literature, ethics, law, politics and yes a dab of economics. These were all lumped together in what was called ""Course IX"" (still the common nickname for decades). Originally obligatory for all MIT students, Course IX later became optional and the only non-science specialization at MIT for a long time.

In sum, up until the 1870s, despite the experiments and the Morrill act, little had actually changed. Although there were now some special schools with modern curricula, the main colleges were still married to their classical curriculum. Classics dominated, and the only economics was delivered by presidents (or their moral philosophy proxies) in the generic final year course, and that was it. Many of the new state universities created by the Morrill Act merely replicated that formula, or remained in a state of flux.

It is only in the 1870s that things began to really change. And even then, only slowly.

1870s Changes

The main influence for change in the 1870s was three factors.

(1) Firstly, that undergraduate students were now older - whereas previous to the Civil War, they had enrolled in college at fifteen or so, they now began to enroll later, and thus the pedagogic value of the classical education, with its mental and moral training for teenagers, were no longer seen as vital for 18- and 19-year-old adults. University authorities gradually began to recognize that specialization in electives was more useful for their futures than a tour-de-force of ancient classics.

(2) Secondly, the enrollment of women in coeducational land grant and other colleges broadened the student base. A narrow mandatory classical education seemed less appropriate for young women. Moreover, the influx demanded more courses and more teachers, which afforded the opportunity to create more elective courses (Michigan, Cornell and Boston went co-ed by 1879; Berkeley co-ed by 1870)

(3) Thirdly, the arrival of the ""new generation"" of American scholars, who had gone for graduate training in Germany, and came home looking for positions. German-trained Americans began as a trickle in the early 1870s, but turned into a flood by the 1880s. Again, American universities were only hiring tutors in Greek, Latin and mathematics, even in the new Morrill colleges. The new generation of teachers put pressure for change.

The leading reformers of the 1870s had done earlier tours of Europe and were eager to introduce the modern German education model into the US. Now older and nearer positions of power, many ascended into university president positions and made common cause with the new generation. The leading names are well known - presidents Daniel Coit Gilman (Hopkins), Andrew Dickson White (Cornell), Charles W. Eliot (Harvard), etc.

Some pinned their hopes on change from within, others in the blank slate opportunities offered by the Morrill Act. When these proved too resistant, they turned to the Gilded Age tycoons - Vanderbilts, Carnegies, Rockefellers, etc. to make new homes for them.

Andrew Dickson White showed the way by roping in Ezra Cornell's Western Union fortune and New York State's Morrill money into creating Cornell University back in 1865. It took a while to get economics organized. Cornell initially started with a moral philosopher (William Dexter Wilson) delivering the economics dose in the fourth year, before White finally got around to hiring their first economist (Henry Carter Adams) in 1879. Adams is notable for being the first Ph.D. in economics to come out of Johns Hopkins.

The Johns Hopkins University, founded 1876 with B&O railroad money, was the brainchild of ex-Sheffielder Daniel Coit Gilman, after his ignoble evacuation from Berkeley. Hopkins was the first German-model research university, with advanced undergraduate and graduate degrees. At Hopkins, economics was still together with history in a joint ""Department of Moral and Historical Sciences"" for many years. (This was not a mere relic - the ""Historicist School"" of German economics, in which the new generation was trained, saw economics, politics and history as integral; the leading Hopkins teachers - economist Richard T. Ely and historian Herbert Baxter Adams - worked together like two gloves.).

While Hopkins could be just have become another experiment, and prospectively meet a similar ignoble fate as the scientific schools, Hopkins changed the dynamics by quickly pumping out a generation of well-trained American economists, ready to be hired in colleges across the country. At a time when new Morrill colleges were finding their footing and trying to grow, or existing colleges looking to add courses to meet the influx, a ""reserve army"" of Hopkins graduates were ready and available.

As mentioned, Hopkins granted its first Ph.D. in economics in 1878 to Henry Carter Adams. But Hopkins had been pipped to the punch by Harvard, which gave its first Ph.D. for an economics topic in 1875 (to Stuart Wood). Indeed, Harvard had spearheaded the reform period of the 1870s with the appointment of MIT chemistry professor Charles W. Eliot as Harvard's new president in 1869. Eliot transferred the modernization lessons of fledgling MIT to Harvard. Eliot took economics away from the wide-ranging moral philosopher Bowen, and appointed Harvard's first dedicated professor of economics, Charles Dunbar, in 1871. Eliot went on to hire a couple more economists a few years later as Dunbar's assistants (Silas MacVane, J. Laurence Laughlin).

The emergence of Johns Hopkins proved fatal for Yale's Sheffield School. Through the 1870s, Francis A. Walker (at Sheffield) and W. G. Sumner (at Yale College) had been dueling for the economics crown in New Haven. Initially, economics was supposed to be contained in Walker's Sheffield ghetto. But W.G. Sumner changed that. Despite his traditionalist background, Sumner turned out to be an economics enthusiast and reformist gnat and pushed the Yale administration into expanding the scope of economics and social sciences at Yale College. He even got a couple of German-trained assistants by the late 1870s (H.W. Farnam and A.T. Hadley - even though they originally hired as Greek & Latin tutors, they were soon teaching ""optional"" courses on economic topics). This took away some of the specialness of Walker's Sheffield. Nonetheless, Walker continued to fight for resources and harbored the fantasy of turning Sheffield into the country's foremost school of economics. Looking beyond New Haven, Walker wanted Sheffield to be where people across the US, interested in a civil service career, or involved in social reform movements, or high school and college teachers wanting to improve their own teaching, could come for special training. The emergence of Johns Hopkins in the late 1870s, fulfilling precisely that role and mopping up all such students, killed that dream. Walker quit Sheffield in 1880, and went on to become president of MIT (after Walker, Sheffield's scope declined and it since became a merely Yale's school of engineering; economics, under Sumner, become firmly established in Yale college).

Although the first Columbia experiment back in 1857 had failed, it was ready to try again by the late 1870s. Columbia president F.A. Barnard changed his mind, and joined forces with a young ""new generation"" history professor John Burgess to launch a ""School of Political Science"" in 1880. In Burgess's scheme, it was to be a French Grande Ecole-style school for the training of civil servants (Burgess's proposal basically translated the curriculum of SciencesPo in Paris). Its curriculum covered economics, history, international law and the like. It was not as firmly segregated as the old scientific schools had been - Columbia college students could enter SPS after completing three years of classics (but they would go on to receive a B.Phil rather than B.A.). Burgess introduced a German-style seminar and Ph.D. for post-graduates. German-trained Richmond Mayo-Smith was the first economist appointed to Columbia, and raised to ""professor of political economy"" in 1887, when more economists (e.g. Seligman) were brought in. Columbia's SPS was a success and soon would rival Hopkins and arguably surpass it in prominence and production of graduates by the end of the century.

The University of Michigan followed closely. President Angell had reluctantly divested himself of economics in 1880, and passed it over to H.C. Adams (who now split his semesters between Michigan and Cornell), and made a couple other social science and history appointments (T.M. Cooley, C.K. Adams). During Angell's absence on a mission to China in 1880-81, Michigan established a ""School of Political Science"" on Columbia's model.

The University of Pennsylvania tapped gilded age fortunes to create the Wharton School that same year (1880), not for civil servants per se, but for the training of business and political leaders. Penn's history in economics is actually a little interesting, since it was the most overtly political. Never quite a domineered clerical bastion like the older Ivy Leagues, Penn's trustees included many notable Philadelphia industrialists, and they were adamant about having their views on economic policy (notably American System protectionism) delivered to the students. They ejected Penn president Henry Vethake in 1860, who had been delivering economics as part of the final year course for a while, for not being protectionist enough, and in 1870 introduced a new required social sciences course (and from 1874 a dedicated professor of social sciences, Ralph Ellis Thompson), with readings coming exclusively out of Henry Carey's textbook. Industrialist Joseph Wharton (a Carey disciple) wanted to reinforce that mission. The creation of the Wharton School in 1880 gave the funds for the hiring of a new slate of German-trained ""new generation"" economists (E.J.James, S.N. Patten) through Wharton who crossed over with the main Penn college and took over Thompson's social sciences load. The rise of a new provost, William Pepper, an enthusiast of the German model, in 1881, reinforced that direction. 1880s & after

Economics at the beginning of the 1870s had been practically non-existent and teaching limited to the president (or his proxy) in a final year. A decade later, by the beginning of the 1880s, economics professors began being appointed and a slate of elective courses on a variety of economics topics began popping up on the menu in many schools. It was still not exclusively economics - it was usually married with modern history and politics under political science or social sciences generally. But by the late 1880s it was already being pushed in the direction of further specialization.

The new generation of German-trained Americans were the principal spirits behind the reform push in the 1880s, towards the German model in American universities. In places like Hopkins, the German seminar model was introduced, and students had to present a research theses to graduate. But the seminar model did not take hold everywhere, or became limited to a graduate school thing (e.g. Columbia). Nonetheless, there were significant changes at the undergraduate level, the old Oxbridge method of tutoring, strict reading and recitation fell away, replaced by more open-ended lectures and written exams, which continues to characterize American colleges today.

The new generation brought not only German-style education, but also German-style economics to American shores - specifically, the German Historical School. With it came a suspicion of economic theory and an attachment to empiricism and historicism. In the 1880s, feisty new generation economists broke into Methodenstreit fights with the old guard in the pages of contemporary American magazines and reviews.

The new generation also carried German policy ideas about the role of the state. They were suspicious of laissez faire, and saw the mission of economics in the service of social reform, which fed into the growing progressive movement, sometimes spilled over into outright socialism. Many of the new professors of economics styled themselves public intellectuals, wrote about social sciences and policy generally, and spoke openly in the local and national press about hot topics which sometimes landed them in hot water with still-clerical administrators and conservative university trustees.

As the Gilded Age advanced, there were still more universities created out of the industrialist fortunes. 

Stanford University (f.1884) tapped into the Central Pacific fortune of railroad tycoon Leland Stanford, as a vanity project of Stanford himself, after he was rejected by the political-dominated Board of Regents of the University of California. He had no idea what he wanted to do with it, but hired a president David Starr Jordan who had very much the Hopkins model in mind, and stocked it with Hopkins graduates. Economics was envisaged from the start as part of political science and sociology. But Stanford had immense growing pains - particularly over the issue of salaries and academic freedom. Dominated by Jane Stanford (the widow of Leland), who insisted on hiring and firing professors at will, Stanford was unable to hold on to faculty for long and became a revolving door with a poor reputation that took many decades to overcome. So Stanford is not really a factor at this stage, other than a temporary staging post in the careers of many economists.

The University of Chicago (f.1892) took Standard Oil money of John D. Rockefeller. Unlike Stanford, Rockefeller gave Chicago president William Rainey Harper virtual carte blanche. And Harper used it to build the first exclusive economics department in the country, unattached to any other division. Harper raided Cornell and other universities for faculty. Its first economics professor, J. Laurence Laughlin became a sort of the ""King Arthur"" of Chicago economics - a semi-mythical founder of Chicago's combative conservatism, and presided for nearly three decades over a round-table of varied young knights that came and went. Unlike Stanford, Chicago became a factor almost immediately.

The creation of Chicago threatened Wisconsin's bid as the premier Midwestern university (Michigan aside), and prompted Wisconsin to finally get its act together. President Bascom had been run out by the trustees in 1887 for his excessive progressive moral crusading. The new president T.C. Chamberlin had an affectation for German model, but also the original Wisconsin ""public service"" mission in mind. He began implementing both immediately - introducing extension lectures on practical topics for the Wisconsin public, promoting greater interaction between the College of Agriculture and practicing farmers, while at the same time introducing more Germanic research-orientated graduate programs for the Wisconsin students. But, as mentioned, the creation of Chicago proved a threat, and Chamberlin hurriedly founded the ""School of Economics, Political Science and History"" in 1892 (arguing the French civil service angle) and succeeded in roping in the dean of the new generation, Richard T. Ely (then unhappy at Hopkins) to head it. Ely arrived with a coterie of junior faculty and advanced students from Hopkins. Wisconsin's rise as a bastion of Institutionalist economics begins here. Associations

Professionalization and specialization quickly followed, and by the late 1880s had taken wing.

It is unsurprising that the first professional associations - the AEA (f.1886) and the AAPSS (f.1889) - came out of the most German of schools, Johns Hopkins and Penn respectively. But associations had started earlier and had growing pains of their own.  The earliest American association in the social sciences (generally speaking) was the American Statistical Association (f. 1839). It had been founded on the model of the British SSL, where social science researchers (mostly amateurs and social reformers) could meet and present empirical data on social stuff they had collected to each other.  In a similar spirit, the American Social Science Association (ASSA) had been founded in 1865 by a group of charities in Boston, and was modeled on the British NAPSS. This came in response to mass immigration and rapid urbanization of the 1850s which had brought up a series of social problems in many eastern cities. The ASSA was not an academic organization, but a social reform organization. Its intent was to bring together educated people of various backgrounds (activists, academics, clerics, charity workers, businessmen, politicians, etc.) in contact with each other, to present their findings, and coordinate with each other on legislative proposals (on public health, sanitation, education, urban planning, police and penal system, trade unions, etc.). The ASSA was never really effective as a national organization, given that most such reforms were the prerogative of municipal and state legislatures, rather than national. So some local chapters of the ASSA were better organized and more active than others.

The big thing of the ASSA was its annual national conference, where people from all over the country met. In the 1880s, as social scientists were finally setting themselves up in universities as professional academics, it quickly dawned that this was a unique opportunity for holding parallel conferences on more exclusively academic topics they were researching. The Johns Hopkins academics were the first to part ways and use the annual ASSA meeting to set up exclusive sessions for themselves, without the confusing hoi polloi of amateurs. The historians, under Herbert Baxter Adams, defected first, founding the American Historical Association (AHA) in 1884. This was followed up by the economists, under Richard T. Ely, who founded the American Economic Association (AEA) in 1886. These moves had encouraged by Hopkins president Gilman as a way to raise Hopkins's national profile.

But the idea for the AEA was actually older. The Penn economists, besides being all German-trained and faithfully protectionist, were also the first to come up with the idea of putting economics in the service of economic and social reform, along the lines of the German Verein fur Socialpoliitk. While still students in Halle, Germany, James and Patten had drafted the first scheme for an equivalent American association, to fight the influence of ""British"" economics (with its attachment to laissez faire and free trade), and embrace a more ""German"" economics (more protectionist, with an interventionist state). But Ely pipped them to the punch, and established the AEA in 1886 with a manifesto articulating the similar Verein-like principles and goals.

The Penn economists (James, Patten) actually protested the creation of the AEA. They disliked the professional character of the AEA and the segregation of economics from the other social sciences. They urged economists should stay under the ""Economics"" and ""Finance"" sections of the ASSA meetings as the best avenue to fulfill its social reform function. They saw the AHA & AEA defections as a Hopkins-engineered gambit to take over. As the ASSA was impotent to prevent it, and hobbled as a result, the Penn guys decided to strike out on their own and founded their own association, more in line with the original open ASSA spirit. The Philadelphia branch of the ASSA  was one of the more active branches anyway, so it was not too hard to elevate that branch into a new American Academy of Political and Social Science (AAPSS, f.1889). Despite its national monicker, the activities of the AAPSS were primarily coordinated between Pennsylvania schools (Penn, Bryn Mawr, Swarthmore, etc.)

Conservative economists did not like the German historicist and socialist spirit of Ely's AEA, and had already founded their own small exclusive private ""Political Economy Club"" in 1883 (main spirit was J. Laurence Laughlin, then at Harvard, and Hopkins's Simon Newcomb), modeled on the similar London dining-discussion club. The AEA and the PE Club threw muck at each other for a little while, but it was clear the AEA, with its more open membership and more professional character had the upper hand, and the PE Club dissipated. Laughlin refused to join the AEA and chided former members, like Harvard's Taussig, from breaking ranks and doing so.

The main move for the ""acceptability"" of the AEA was ejection of Ely in 1892 for too much radicalism. After Ely's departure, the AEA took decisive moves to become a more broad-based, more academic, more professional, and less polemical, and neutral on policy.

Ely's ""loss of control"" of the AEA was not taken kindly his fellow travelers, and provoked a new split in 1895: the creation of the ""Political Science Association"" (PSA). The name was deceptive. It was an economics association, chock-full of bona fide economists - mainly Institutionalist economists from the Midwest, who had been former colleagues and students of Ely (notably HC Adams at Michigan and John Commons, then at Indiana; Ely himself had moved to Wisconsin in 1892). Disappointed by the neutral turn of the AEA, the PSA explicitly ""restored"" the original political and social reform goals of the original AEA. Although the PSA diplomatically assured the AEA that it was not a rival organization, but merely a regional one, limited to the Midwest, it was nonetheless perceived as a threat. The PSA charged that the AEA was dominated by eastern economists, that meetings were always east of the Alleghenies, negligent of the needs and struggles of Midwestern states, and the pressure which Midwestern economists were under in their universities (this was the height of agrarian socialism and the Bryan campaign, where Midwestern economists being asked to pick sides). The threat of schism prompted the AEA to hold joint meetings with the PSA in Indianapolis (Commons's base) in 1895 and elected HC Adams as president to mollify the midwesterners. The PSA lingered on as a regional organization, but its schismatic character dissipated when Ely was unexpectedly elected president of the AEA in 1899, healing some of the old rifts.

[Note: the second PSA - the modern APSA - was created in the early 1900s, not for ideological or regional reasons, but rather professional reasons; as further specialization in the late 1890s and early 1900s finally separated economics from sociology from political science, and professors in the latter wanted their own professional association. With the academics all gone into their own associations, the ASSA was hallowed out, and basically wound up by 1909.]

Publications

Early American economists tended to publish sparingly but widely, in general-interest reviews, like the Atlantic Monthly, Harper's, the New Englander, the Princeton Review, North American Review, etc. The closest thing to an economics journal in the 1870s was the curious International Review, a review of history and social sciences, edited by the president of Lehigh University.

But beginning in the mid-1880s, a slate of new dedicated economics publications were launched to advertise the research of the new departments and associations. Again, this was very similar to the model in German universities. The Hopkins folks blazed the way with launching the The Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science in 1882, properly speaking a periodically-published paper series rather than a journal. 1886 was a banner year: it saw the launch of Harvard's Quarterly Journal of Economics and Columbia's Political Science Quarterly and also the Publications of the AEA (half-paper series, half-journal that would drag out to 1911, when firmly journal AER was founded). The Penn guys launched the Annals of the AAPSS in 1891, Chicago responded with the Journal of Political Economy in 1892, while Yale social scientists took over the Yale Review in 1892 and made it effectively their house organ. Further afield, Michigan launched the Publications of the Michigan Political Science Association in 1893.

Berkeley,"    [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by University of California or any other organization. See the official Berkeley website] The University of California was established by the State of California in 1868, with its flagship campus at Berkeley. California was the westernmost part of a large chunk of territory ceded by Mexico the United States in 1848, after the brief Mexican-American war.  Distant and relatively inaccessible, California was originally sparsely populated.  But the 1849 Gold Rush quickly changed all that, and brought a massive stream of  immigrants from the east.  The sleepy old mission town of San Francisco, at the entry of the San Francisco Bay, catapulted from less than 500 persons to 25,000 in a less than a year.  By 1850, California was populous enough to apply for admission as a new state of the United States. In 1862, the US Congress passed the Morrill Act making grants of federal land for states to fund the erection of colleges of ""agricultural and mechanical arts"".  But there was no formula on what that meant.  While some took it to mean it had to be a technical school, to train farmers and machinists, the federal act specifically noted it did not have to exclude standard academic fare like classics or sciences generally.  Having populated rapidly, California, at the time, had next to no schools of any kind in place, and so the State legislature of California determined to use the Morrill funds to address the education deficiency.  Many originally looked to older state schools, like Wisconsin, as a model, but tussles on the design delayed plans. California submitted a hazy proposal in 1866, just before the Morrill five-year deadline, to ensure it did not miss out, but it was merely a barely adequate outline and it would take a few more years to take shape and launch. For location, they naturally chose the San Francisco Bay area, the most populated region of the state at the time.  To get it up and going as quickly as possible, the State struck a deal with the local College of California, a private Presbyterian-Congregationalist high school that had been set up by pioneers in Oakland a few years earlier (1854).  The College transferred its existing facilities, and some of its teachers and administrators, to the University of California in 1868.  This is formally the beginning of the University of California.  The college facilities were temporary, and the State purchased a large empty track of land north of Oakland, which they elected to call ""Berkeley"" (after the Enlightenment thinker), to erect the main permanent campus.  From the outset, the university was non-sectarian and became co-educational from 1870.  California opened for classes in the Fall of 1869, with nine teachers but as yet no president (Civil War general George B. McClellan had been offered the post, but turned it down).  A Board of Regents, composed of elected state officials, was set up to govern the university, but was still debating the shape of the university. In the 1868 charter, the University of California envisaged six colleges: Letters, Agriculture, Mechanics, Chemistry, Mining, and Civil Engineering.  By the terms of the State's deal with the College of California, the latter college would essentially continue as before, recast the ""College of Letters"" of the University, and teach a standard academic curriculum in the liberal arts, dominated by classics (Latin, Greek, mathematics, etc.) while the five remaining technical colleges were under construction.  But several politicians felt that the compromise was inadequate, and the continuation of archaic curriculum was an affront to the new university's mission of public usefulness.  So they made an offer to education reformer Daniel Coit Gilman, then at Yale's Sheffield School, who had set up a pioneering curriculum in modern subjects (natural and applied sciences, modern history, modern languages, geography, international law, economics, etc.).  But Gilman was angling for the presidency of Yale itself, and decided to wait until that failed in 1872, to resign from Sheffield and take up California's offer (Henry Durant, the retired head of the College of California. served as interim president until 1872)  After his arrival in 1872, president Gilman promptly set about trying to bring his vision into fruition, appointing more professors and proposed setting up additional professional colleges in Law and Medicine. In emulation of Sheffield, Gilman himself taught a courses in political economy, geography and history in the main college for the first couple of years. The university finally moved from Oakland to its new Berkeley campus in 1873.  The Morrill funds only covered establishment of the university, the operating expenses were dependent on appropriations by the State legislature, making the university a political issue of wider interest.  Seeking to break the university's dependence on the State, Gilman set about trying to raise an endowment by seeking private donations from the nouveau riche California business community.  But Gilman could not outrun California's politics.   From the outset, the California press, notably the San Francisco Evening Post edited by Henry George, decried the fledgling university, noting that the Morrill Act required that it be a technical school, not a school of ""polite learning"".  By ""technical"" they understood ""vocational"", and were dissatisfied when Gilman's appointed academic scientists rather than practitioners to head the technical colleges.  Their bark was given bite when the ""Granger movement"", a coalition of farmers organized to fight  monopolistic railway rates, erupted in California.  The Grangers formed a new political party (""People's Independents"") and defeated both Democrats and Republicans in the California state elections of 1873.  Denouncing all forms of elitism, the Grangers took aim at the university and Gilman in particular.  Gilman's courtship of the California business elites only stoked Granger antagonism, and ensured those same elites kept their wallets closed until the dust settled.  The legislature debated seizing control of the university, dismantling all but the agricultural and mechanical colleges, and replacing the appointed Board of Regents with a popularly-elected governing board.   The local press (notably George) made sensational allegations of corruption in university building contracts.  Although an inquiry by the State legislature in 1874 exonerated the Regents, things did not stabilize.  The Granger campaign to bring the university under tighter public control, and  and transform it into ""a sort of low manual labor school"" (Gilman's words), crippled the fund-raising efforts.  Concluding that Berkeley's outlook was bleak, Gilman did not have to think twice when the opportunity came up to head a new private university funded by Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, and resigned the presidency of California in 1875..  The University limped on, under an interim president, John LeComte, a physician.  A German-trained ""new generation"" historian Bernard Moses was brought in 1876 as Professor of History and Political Science, and took over Gilman's social science load, including economics   Nonetheless, the California regents apparently felt there was a need for a separate professor in political economy and seem to have opened a competition for it.  San Francisco journalist Henry George threw his hat into the ring, and in 1877 delivered a lecture at Berkeley on the ""study of political economy"", the kernel of what was to become Progress and Poverty (1879).  However, nothing came of this.  For the next fifteen years, Bernard Moses taught all the economics, history and jurisprudence courses almost single-handedly.  Moses founded the short-lived Berkeley Quarterly in 1880, and carved out the Department of History and Political Science in 1882. In 1879, the State Constitution of California was amended, and Article IX, Section 9 converted the University of California into a public trust corporation, and guaranteed its continued existence in its original form.  Legislative interference was now limited, but not non-existent.  The immediate existential threat to the university was lifted, but the situation at Berkeley remained unsettled for the next few decades.  The series of weak presidents, many merely acting presidents drawn from the faculty, continued to play a defensive role against the continued interference of heavy-handed California politicians.  But the establishment of Stanford University in nearby Palo Alto in the late 1880s. The ""College of Commerce"" (future Haas School of Business) was founded in 1898, and Carl Plehn was appointed its first dean. In 1902, the ""Flood Endowment"", financed by the Bear Gulch Water Company, provided the principal funding ($5m) for Commerce school.  In the main Berkeley college, economics was originally taught as part of the ""Department of History and Political Science"",  until it a separate ""Department of Economics"" was created in 1902 and placed under Adolph C. Miller.  A former Berkeley graduate, then at the Univ of Chicago. Millar returned to Berkeley as the new Flood Professor of Economics and head of the department. Miller's former Chicago student Wesley Clair Mitchell joined Berkeley in early 1903 as junior faculty.   Moses continued teaching in the History and Political Science departments.  Moses's former student Jessica Peixotto, fresh with a new Columbia Ph.D., was appointed lecturer in ""social economics"" at Berkeley in 1900.

Chicago," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the University of Chicago or any other organization. See the official University of Chicago website] The ""Chicago School"" is perhaps one of the better known American ""schools"" of economics.   In its strictest sense, the ""Chicago School""  refers to the approach of the members of the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago over the past century.  In a looser sense, the term ""Chicago School"" is associated with a particular brand of economics which adheres strictly to Neoclassical price theory in its economic analysis, ""free market"" libertarianism in much of its policy work and a methodology which is relatively averse to too much mathematical formalism and willing to forego careful general equilibrium reasoning in favor of more results-oriented partial equilibrium analysis.  In recent years, the ""Chicago School"" has  been associated with ""economic imperialism"", i.e. the application of economic reasoning to areas traditionally considered the prerogative of other fields such as political science, legal theory, history and sociology.    The ""Chicago School"" has had various phases with quite different characteristics.  Nonetheless, the main consistent factor seems to be that it has always held a unique,distinct and influential place in the realm of economics at any time.  In the modern day, under the ""Chicago School"" umbrella, we can count various further schools of thought which are discussed in more detail elsewhere:  e.g. Monetarism in the 1960s, New Classical/Real Business Cycle macroeconomics from the 1970s until today, and more recently, the New Institutionalism, New Economic History and Law-and-Economics movements.  Laughlin era The University of Chicago was founded in 1892,  funded primarily by the oil magnate John D. Rockefeller. It was the brainchild of the energetic young William Rainey Harper, then a professor of Hebrew and Biblical Study at Yale, who persuaded Rockefeller and the Baptist community in the Midwest to revive an older Baptist theological seminary in Chicago, which had gone defunct in 1886.  But Harper had in mind the modern ""German-style"" research university model (as pioneered at Johns  Hopkins).  The University of Chicago was chartered in 1890, and its doors opened in October 1892.  Armed with Rockefeller money and a charter which gave him near-monarchical authority, President Harper plundered other universities for faculty - nine university presidents were lured away to take up positions at Chicago, the Chicago science faculty was virtually transplanted wholesale from Clark University. Economics formed a separate ""Department of Political Economy"" from the start - the first separate economics department in an American university. Harper had originally hoped to lure Richard T. Ely (then unhappy at Hopkins), but Ely's salary demands were too high, so Harper turned instead to raiding Cornell.  Harper placed economics under  Ely's ideological opposite, the American apologist, J. Laurence Laughlin, then at Cornell, who brought along a coterie of younger Cornell men with him to Chicago - junior associate Adolph C. Miller, students Thorstein Veblen and Robert Hoxie, and philosopher William Caldwell (who also lectured in economics).  Harvard graduate William Hill was brought in as instructor in 1893, and went on to launch Chicago's program in agricultural economics. Sociologist Albion W. Small and philosopher John Dewey were two other notable figures in the early Chicago years.  Over Laughlin's objections, Harper also brought on board Ely's student, Edward W. Bemis as professor of economics in the extension division.  Nonetheless, a strident socialist, Bemis was shown the door in 1895, notionally for incompetence, but also for Bemis's public criticism of railway owners (many of whom were university trustees and donors) in the aftermath of the Pullman strike.  Pennsylvania heavyweight Edmund J. James was brought in 1896 as professor public administration and to take over the Chicago extension program. Bemis's allegations of mistreatment did not seem to apply to Thorstein Veblen, who was arguably even more radical.  Veblen was saddled from the start with editing the house journal, the Journal of Political Economy, launched in late 1892.  Veblen went on to write some of his most important works while at Chicago.  Despite his radicalism, his notorious distaste for teaching and his scandalous romantic dalliances - ""women liked him, and he did not object"" - Veblen was valued by Laughlin, Dewey and other faculty members.  Nonetheless, it was Veblen's extra-curricular activities that eventually led Harper, over Laughlin's objections, to demand Veblen's resignation in 1906.  Among notable early Chicago students who came under Veblen's spell was labor economist Richard F. Hoxie (who stayed on until his suicide in 1916), Wesley Clair Mitchell (graduating in 1899, he stayed on as instructor until 1903) and Herbert J. Davenport (graduating in 1898, Davenport joined the Chicago faculty in 1900, but disappointed after Veblen's departure, himself left in 1908).  Alvin S. Johnson arrived in 1910, but was lured shortly after to Stanford..  By the example of the pre-existing Divinity School, president Harper dreamed of setting up professional schools to complement arts and sciences. Consonant with this objective, Laughlin led the way in the creation of the ""College for Commerce and Politics"" in 1898.   Initially, it was merely a set of interdisciplinary courses designed for the final two years of undergraduate students intending to take a career in business.  It would eventually evolve into the Chicago Graduate School of Business.  This was followed up by the establishment of the University College of Teachers in 1898 (with E.J. James as dean, until his departure in 1902), the Law School in 1902 and, later on, the School of Social Service Administration in 1919 .  Harper died in 1907, and was succeeded as president of the University of Chicago by the political scientist Harry Pratt Judson.  Laughlin remained in charge of Chicago economics, bringing in economic historian Chester W. Wright in 1907 and Leon C. Marshall in 1909 (who took up the deanship of the Business School).   Despite his personal affection for early Institutionalists like Veblen and Hoxie, Laughlin himself had been dogmatically (Neo)classical (relying strictly on J.S. Mill and A. Marshall), and maintained something of a feud with Institutionalist bastions like Columbia and Wisconsin.  In this respect, the Chicago School's ferocious attachment to Neoclassicism could be said to start with Laughlin - if Laughlin himself had fully committed to marginalist revolution, rather than continued flirting  with Ricardianism. Nonetheless,  an attachment to economic theory was instilled in students like Davenport (who would go on to mentor Knight at Cornell).  But Chicago's eclecticism in the Laughlin years pointed in no specific direction.  The departure of Veblen, Davenport, Johnson and Hoxie's death hit Laughlin hard - like an embittered King Arthur who couldn't hold on to his young knights, Laughlin retired in 1916, leaving the department in the hands of Leon Marshall.  The young Jacob Viner was brought in 1916, and while many mark this as the passing of the torch, Viner did not stay - instead, Viner followed his old Harvard master Taussig to Washington in 1917.  Viner would return to Chicago in 1919, but by this time the luminary figure at Chicago was John Maurice Clark.  Clark had arrived in 1915, and taken over the theory courses after Laughlin's retirement.  Under Clark's influence, Chicago took a more conventional Institutionalist turn, like many other departments in the United States.  After nearly a decade, John Maurice Clark left Chicago in 1926, returning to Columbia.  The appointments of public finance specialist Simeon E. Leland in 1927 and economic historian John U. Nef in 1928 seemed to reinforce the Institutionalist direction Clark had started.  But Clark's successor, Frank H. Knight was to change everything.   First Chicago School The ""Chicago School"" really began in the 1920s with the diumvirate of Frank H. Knight (appointed in 1926) and Jacob Viner (appointed permanently in 1919) taking the helm after Clark's departure.  They were, for the most part, theoreticians (Knight more in the Jevonian-Austrian tradition, Viner leaning towards the Marshallian).  In an age when empiricism ruled most of American economics, Knight and Viner set up the economics department at Chicago as a bastion of counter-institutionalism and, as such, the department soon acquired something of a ""siege"" mentality.    Also at Chicago during this time were the ""Mathematical Trio"" --   Oskar Lange, Henry Schultz and Paul H. Douglas -- economists with a particular bent for the theoretical approach of the Lausanne School.   Younger faculty included monetary theorists Henry C. Simons and Lloyd Mints. The characteristics of the early Chicago School of 1920-1950 differ considerably from the later Chicago School.  They were highly suspicious of ""positivistic"" economic methodology and denounced economic imperialism, arguing for a confined role for economic analysis (esp. Knight).  They were suspicious of the efficiency claims of laissez-faire economics, arguing for it only on a ""non-consequential"" basis.  They welcomed active government policies to cure recessions (esp. Viner's recommendations on ""reinflating"" the economy, and Simons's  ""Chicago Plan"" for counter-cyclical monetary policy), and counted a fully-fledged  socialist in their ranks (Lange).   Furthermore, most of the faculty was not averse to rigorous, theoretical general equilibrium reasoning, but were leading practitioners of the art (Lange, Schultz, Douglas). However, like the later Chicago School, the early Chicago School was hostile to ""alternative"" economic paradigms.  For the most part, they did not welcome the Keynesian Revolution in macroeconomics and denounced the Monopolistic Competition approach in microeconomic theory.  To a good extent, the issues these ""alternative"" paradigms purported to solve, they felt could be handled reasonably well within the confines of Neoclassical theory.  The economics department underwent an upheaval during the 1940s.  Schultz died with tragic suddenness, Viner left for Princeton, Lange left for political life in Poland and Douglas became a U.S. Senator.  Knight, whose interests were moving away from economic theory, went into semi-retirement, handing the reigns of the department over to Simons, Mints and Director. There was a new injection of blood during this period as the department tried to regain its bearings.  The first lurch was towards Walrasian economics.  Several students associated with the departed Lange and Schultz remained -- such as Yntema and Mosak -- and Chicago went on to welcome Jacob Marschak, Tjalling Koopmans and the the Cowles Commission right next door.  The Walrasian period lasted until 1955, when it moved (was hounded off?) to Yale. The 1940s also saw the appointment of development theorists H. Gregg Lewis and Bert F. Hoselitz. These appointments were accompanied by a group of agricultural economists, Theodore W. Schultz, D. Gale Johnson and Walter Nicholls, who had left Iowa State in protest over one of the most famous violations of academic freedom. Apparently, the powers-that-be of Iowa, home of the American dairy industry, had pressured the university to force a young economist to recant a study in which he had concluded that margarine was no less nutritious than butter. Second Chicago School In the 1960s, the department began to congeal into a new shape, led by  Milton Friedman (who joined in 1946) and George J. Stigler (a graduate, who returned to Chicago in 1957)    This is the core of what became the ""Second"" Chicago School, which is perhaps the most famous and polemical one.  Stigler and Friedman were avowed Marshallians, and eschewed the methodology of the now-departed Walrasians of the Cowles Commission.  As the contemporary ditty went: ""I read my Marshall completely through
From beginning to end and backward too
I read my Marshall so carefully
That now I am Professor at U of C"".  The Stigler-Friedman period was characterized by faithful adherence to Neoclassical economics and maintained itself dead against the concept of market failures, reinforcing the Chicago School stance against  imperfect competition and Keynesian economics. Through their influential journals -- notably, the Journal of Political Economy and the Journal of Law and Economics -- the research programme of the Chicago School was advanced and diffused.  It was the Second Chicago School that is often accused of being the modern version of  Manchester School liberalism (or, as some maintain, the more conservative tradition of  American apologism). In microeconomics, led by George Stigler, the guiding maxim in the Chicago approach was to preserve the Neoclassical paradigm whenever possible, never to doubt it. When there is no obvious solution to a particular problem, the recommended course was to extend the Neoclassical paradigm by incorporating new concepts into it that would make the subject matter amenable to economic analysis. Examples of extensions to the Neoclassical paradigm conceived by Chicago economists are search theory (due to George Stigler), human capital theory (due to Gary Becker and T.W. Schultz) and property rights/transaction cost theory (due to Ronald H. Coase).   The Chicago School's impulse for extension of Neoclassical price theory is largely responsible for the ""imperialist"" character of which it is often accused.   Business and finance, previously the prerogative of practitioners and business schools, were brought into the economic spotlight by Chicago economists such as A.W. Wallis, Harry Markowitz, Merton H. Miller and Eugene F. Fama.  Further afield, political science and institutional theory were brought into Neoclassical economics by Chicago School economists such as G.J. Stigler, R.H. Coase, James Buchanan, Armen Alchian and Harold Demsetz.  Economic history were given a Neoclassical reading by Robert W. Fogel and Douglas C. North, while the Chicago Law School (esp. Richard Posner and William M. Landes) used economics to rethink swathes of legal theory.  Perhaps most famously, sociological issues like addiction, family and even marriage were given a thoroughly economic interpretation in the hands of Gary S. Becker and Jacob Mincer. [Naturally, not all the ""Chicago School"" economists are at the University of Chicago, e.g. Alchian, Mincer, North, etc., but it is not unreasonable to argue that they are part of that school of thought.] [George P. Shultz, better known as the Secretary of Labor and subsequently of the Treasury under Richard Nixon and later Secretary of State under Ronald Reagan, Shultz was also professor of industrial relations and later dean of the Business School at Chicago during the 1960s.] [It is revealing that the adamantly anti-imperialist Friedrich A. von Hayek,  who was at Chicago during the 1950s, was confined to an appointment on an interdisciplinary ""Committee on Social Thought"", rather than the economics department proper.  Walrasian theory, which has tended to be of more limited scope, has also had very little presence at Chicago over the past half-century: the only theorist to have successfully infiltrated the Chicago citadel was Hugo Sonnenschein, but then he came as president of the university.  With the exception of the work of Lester Telser, the ""alternative"" paradigm of game theory has also been conspicuously absent until recently.] In macroeconomics, the most renowned phase of the Chicago School has been that of ""Monetarism"" under the leadership of Milton Friedman, its best-known advocate. For the longest time, Chicago was the only school in America not swept by the Keynesian Revolution (the presence of Lloyd A. Metzler  on the faculty was exceptional - Metzler being brought in by T.W. Schultz as the ""house Keynesian"" to balance Friedman). This does not mean that the old Chicago School was opposed to government intervention - indeed, Viner's policy conclusions are at times hard to distinguish from Keynes's.  But in Friedman's Monetarism, it found a theoretical and empirical means by which to begin rolling back the Keynesian revolution. Although prominent in the 1960s, Friedman has always claimed that the main tenets of Monetarism can be found in the work of early Chicago School economists such as Henry Simons.  (see our  survey of Monetarism). Monetarism has since given way to the more mathematically rigorous ""New Classical"" economics of Robert E. Lucas in the 1970s and 1980s.  The quantitatively-oriented ""Walrasian"" flavor of New Classicism meant that the appointments of Robert Lucas, Thomas Sargent, Michael Woodford and Robert Townsend at Chicago met with quite some opposition from the older hands.  Nonetheless, in its policy conclusions and rigorous adherence to Neoclassical theory, the New Classical school remains by most accounts the natural inheritor of the Chicago School mantle in modern macroeconomics. Despite, or perhaps as a result of, its mischievous but always unique perspective, the University of Chicago has taken in a lion's share of Nobel Prizes in economics: Milton Friedman, T.W. Schultz, G.J.Stigler, R.H. Coase, G.S. Becker, M.H. Miller, R.W. Fogel and R.E.Lucas were all on the Chicago faculty when they received their awards.  If we were to add  Chicago-trained economists, the list of Nobelists would expand to include Hebert Simon, James Buchanan, Harry Markowitz and Myron Scholes.

Columbia," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by Columbia University or any other organization. See the official Columbia University website] Columbia University, nestled in the New York City, is one of the √©lite ""Ivy League"" colleges of the United States.  Founded in 1754 as ""King's College"", Columbia was originally designed as a college for Episcopalian clergy, originally attached to Trinity Church in lower Manhattan. After the American revolution, the college applied for a new charter from the New York legislature.  A public charter was granted in 1784, placing it under the governance of the Regents of the University of the State of New York and renaming it ""Columbia"".  The charter raised its status from college to ""university"" and envisaged four faculties - Arts, Medicine, Law and Divinity, with an assortment of salaried and unsalaried professors.  However, it was soon realized that the rotating politicians that constituted the Regents by virtue of their office was inadequate, so a the charter was amended in 1787 and governance entrusted in a permanent, self-perpetuating corporation of ""Trustees"".  Religious tests were removed from the university charter, and it was open to all denominations, at least in principle, although Columbia remained nominally Episcopalian and some of religious restrictions that had come attached with endowments and gifts continued, despite being eliminated by the charter (notably, that the president must be an Episcopalian).  This came to a head in 1811, when the prime candidate for the presidency of Columbia was John M.  Mason, a religious delinquent.  Columbia ""resolved"" the problem by appointing Mason to ""Provost"", with expanded near-presidential powers, and appointing a conventional Episcopalian as figurehead president. Columbia's efforts in the professional faculties fared poorly.  Of the original four faculties, Divinity was never established; and Medicine was established only briefly (it was discontinued in 1813).  Law lingered on, but with difficulties.. Only the Faculty of Arts of Columbia College seemed to gain any traction, but fund-raising was always a problem. For much of its early history, the traditionalist Columbia remained on unfriendly terms with the more religiously diverse New York business community.  Its attempts to curry favor (and donations) with them  may explain why Columbia was one of the first American universities to create a chair in political economy.   Rev. John McVickar was hired as professor of moral philosophy and rhetoric in 1817, and his title was expanded to include ""Political Economy"" in 1826.  McVickar was responsible for teaching a series of classes on economics, as part of a generic course on moral philosophy (which included ethics and history, also taught by McVickar) to final year students. This was in addition to his other teaching duties in classics,  theology and English rhetoric.   McVickar maintained this heavy teaching load at Columbia, for the next forty years. A popular  Ricardian lecturer, McVickar's economics courses were well-attended. Despite the efforts, Columbia's relationship with New York City did not improve.. In 1830, the New York financial and commercial community backed a proposal to create New York University,  a non-denominational university with a modern curriculum, along the lines of London's  UCL.  Trying to fend off the challenge, Columbia responded immediately by creating the ""Scientific and Literary Course"" in 1830, a series of extension lectures in modern subjects (including economics, despite McVickar's opposition to the scheme) for non-matriculated students.  But it was never a success - reportedly it was attended by a grand total of 43 students in its dozen years of existence - and so was quietly abolished in 1843. Columbia's centenary in 1854 was overshadowed by a scandal.  Wolcott Gibbs, backed by the faculty, was slated to succeed the outgoing professor of chemistry.  But Gibbs was a Unitarian, and a group of conservative Episcopalian trustees rallied to prevent his appointment.  The squabble spilled over into the public press and the New York State Senate opened an inquiry into the matter. .The Gibbs affair re-stoked acrimony  between town and gown, and few lamented when Columbia ditched its lower city quarters (Park Place), and moved uptown, to a remoter area of Manhattan (49th & Madison) in 1857. The Gibbs affair had provoked Samuel Ruggles, a New York lawyer and Columbia trustee, to issue a manifesto in 1855 calling for a complete overhaul and modernization of Columbia.  Ruggles's call eventually led to the special commission assembled by president Charles King in 1857 to inquire into the state of education at the university.  Ruggles was the leading light of the commission.  Among its remarkable results was the decision in 1857 to introduce an ""elective year"" for senior students.  That is, that after three solid mandatory years of classics, senior students could opt out of a fourth year of classics (""Letters""), and instead take either a course of Science or a course of Jurisprudence.  The senior Jurisprudence course consisted of natural law, international law, modern history and economics.  The commission also recommended that after their elective year, students in Science and Jurisprudence could continued for two more years to earn an M.A.   The 1857 curriculum required expanding the offerings.  The long-time lecturer McVickar,  advancing in age and spread to thin, could not take on the implied larger teaching load, and so his position was split into three.  McVickar retained theology, while two new hires took over the remainder: Charles Nairne took Moral and Intellectual Philosophy, Rhetoric and English literature, while Francis Lieber, then exiting South Carolina, was appointed professor of Modern History and Political Economy.  German-born and an enthusiast of modern education, Lieber greatly expanded the economics course at Columbia. But the great 1857 experiment never got traction.  Once the crisis was over, the old denizens of Columbia reasserted themselves and reversed the reforms.  The graduate degrees were mothballed before they even started, and by 1861, the ""elective year"" was abolished altogether.  Columbia returned to its traditional classical curriculum.  This was cemented by the arrival of new president Frederick A. Barnard in 1864.  Among his first acts was  ending the expanded economics course and removing Lieber in 1865. Everything went back to how it was before, with economics returning to its confined space in the final year moral philosophy course, now taught by Charles Nairne (who didn't much care for it; Nairne's primary teaching was in rhetoric and literature). Lieber stayed on, but was moved to the professional Law School (founded 1858), as professor of constitutional history and public law.  Economics came virtually to end at Columbia. Although the first Columbia experiment back in 1857 had failed, it was ready to try again by the late 1870s. Columbia president Barnard had changed his mind in the intervening decade.  After the Civil War, the number and age of students enrolling in American colleges creeped up.  Barnard concluded that while ""character-forming"" tour-de-force of the ancient classics was necessary for teenagers, it was not well suited for 19- and 20-year old adults that were the new college students. Elective courses in modern subjects would be more useful for their futures, and began pressing the trustees in that direction.  Barnard found an ally in John W. Burgess, the ambitious young professor of history at Columbia, part of the ""new generation"" of American scholars who had trained in Germany. Lieber had died in 1872, and Burgess had taken up his law school chair sometime after.  In 1876, a new chair in history, political science and international law was created by the now-repentant Barnard, and Burgess elected to fill it. Barnard supported Burgess's scheme to launch a ""School of Political Science"" in 1880, designed along the lines of the French 'Grand Ecoles"" as a training school for civil servants (indeed, Burgess's original curriculum proposal translated that of SciencesPo in Paris almost verbatim)..  Its curriculum covered economics, modern history, international law and the like   Unlike the ""scientific schools"" of Harvard and Yale, the SPS was not completely segregated, but was a re-visitation of the old ""elective year"".  That is, after three years of solid classics, Columbia college students could  enroll in the SPS for their fourth year (albeit they would receive a B.Phil. rather than a B.A.), and could carry on in the SPS for a few years more to earn a graduate degree (Ph.D. rather than M.A.).  Besides reintroducing modern subjects, Burgess also transformed the style of learning.  In imitation of Johns Hopkins, German-style seminars and a final thesis were instituted for the graduate degree.  For the undergraduates, Burgess replaced the disciplined reading and recitation common in Anglo-Saxon schools with German-style responsive lectures and written exams (this style had in fact been first introduced by Lieber back in the late 1850s, but at the time was regarded suspiciously; Columbia colleagues complained Lieber's classes were ""chaotic"").   (On a side-note, adamant about research, Burgess built up a special library for the SPS, and secured the hiring of Melvil Dewey - the inventor of the Dewey decimal system - in 1883 for the main Columbia library). The initial preference in the appointments to Department of Economics and Social Science within the School of Political Science went to the ""new generation"" of German-trained Americans.  Richmond Mayo-Smith, a German-trained social statistician, who been hired by Burgess as his assistant in history in 1877, took charge of the first new economics course at the SPS in 1880.  He was joined by younger assistants Munroe Smith and Charles Bateman..  The first Ph.D. in economics at Columbia was awarded to F.B. Herzog with a dissertation on railroads.  Mayo-Smith was eventually promoted to the title of ""professor of political economy"" in 1887..  In 1886, he was joined by his student, E.R.A. Seligman, freshly back from a training tour of Germany.   That same year, Seligman helped launch the Political Science Quarterly, which was to become the house organ of Columbia.  The quantitative sociologist, Franklin H. Giddings, joined the department in 1892.   In 1895, Columbia lured yet another German-trained economist: American marginalist theorist John Bates Clark. Under Clark, Columbia became the home of his ""Social Value"" school of marginalist economics.  As Mayo-Smith and Giddings gravitated away from economics (a separate department of sociology was finally created in 1905), economics remained firmly in the hands of Seligman and Clark for the next two decades.  Surprisingly, although Seligman and Clark belonged to different schools of thought, they got along very well.  If events elsewhere were any indication, they should have had a Methodenstreit to capture the ""soul"" of the Columbia economics.  But Seligman and Clark respected each other's spheres of activity and remained close friends.   In 1902, Columbia bolstered its ranks with the appointment of Henry R. Seager, a labor economist, and the shy Henry L. Moore, virtually the sole Walrasian on American shores.  The Columbia philosopher John Dewey and the historians Charles A. Beard and Harvey James Robinson contributed to the training of Columbia economics students.  Somewhat apart was the German-trained Vladimir G. Simkhovich, who taught courses on socialism and economic history.  The talismanic Clark gradually retired.  But with these first-rate appointments, Columbia catapulted itself to the forefront of the social sciences in the United States.  From the early 1900s to the end of the First World War, under the leadership of Seligman, Seager and Moore, Columbia was doubtlessly America's premier economics department.  It leapfrogged over Johns Hopkins and was well ahead of Chicago, Harvard, Yale, Cornell or Princeton.  Only Wisconsin could ostensibly challenge Columbia's lead.  The eclecticism of the Columbia economics department in its early glory days is reflected in many of its Ph.Ds, such as William Z. Ripley, Alvin S. Johnson, Benjamin M. Anderson, John Maurice Clark, Paul H. Douglas and Henry Schultz.    The character of the department began to change in 1913 with the appointment of Wesley C. Mitchell (then at Berkeley). Already a prominent business cycle empiricist, Mitchell and his students would make Columbia the formidable bastion of the American Institutionalist school, a hue that would color the department until after World War II. However, the First World War was the more urgent problem.  In 1917, Columbia's conservative President Nicholas Murray Butler fired two Columbia professors for publicly opposing the entry of the United States into the war.   The historian Charles Beard resigned in protest.  A spate of high-level resignations followed, including John Dewey, James Robinson and Wesley Mitchell.  In one fell swoop, Columbia was decimated. Inspired by Veblen, some of the exiled Columbia professors got together and formed the New School for Social Research in 1919.  However, facing a lack of research students at the New School, Mitchell, Dewey and Robinson were gradually lured back to Columbia.     The Institutionalist dominance of Columbia began to take hold around this time.   William Ogburn was appointed to the sociology department in 1919.  In 1920, Mitchell's students, Paul Brissenden and Frederick C. Mills was appointed to the business school. Rexford Tugwell joined the economics department in 1920 and James Bonbright followed suit in 1921.  Robert Hale was given a position in legal studies in 1922 (the year of Mitchell's return).  The hiring of the Neoclassical James W. Angell in 1924 was balanced by the hiring of the Institutionalist John Maurice Clark (son of J.B.) in 1926, away from Chicago to teach the theory component (Jacob Viner was also considered, but his candidacy was set aside, partly over Columbia's concern about ""too many Jews"" in the department)..  Karl Llewellyn joined the Columbia School of Law in 1924 and Adolph A. Berle followed him in 1927.  Eveline Burns and her husband, Arthur R. Burns joined the economics faculty in 1928.   In the 1929-31, Seager died and Dewey, Moore and Seligman retired, thereby leaving the department fully in the Institutionalists' hands.  Carter Goodrich was lured from Michigan in 1930 to take over economic history while Leo Wolman was lured away from the New School in 1931 to take over labor economics.  Benjamin Graham came in from Wall Street to teach finance.  Carl S. Shoup and Joseph Dorfman, two Columbia Ph.Ds, were appointed to the faculty in early 1930s.  Wesley Mitchell's presidential address to the A.E.A. set the tone of the new age: Institutionalism had arrived at its mature stage, and Columbia would lead the way.  Jacob Viner's and Henry Schultz's responses to Mitchell set the other side of the equation: the Neoclassicals had arrived at Chicago and they would resist them every step of the way.  This conflict,  Institutionalists vs. Neoclassicals, Columbia vs. Chicago, AER vs. JPE, would be carried on through the 1920s through the 1940s.   Interestingly, Harvard remained in the middle ground, leaning tentatively towards the Institutionalists.  There was much cross-fertilization between Harvard and Columbia.  The landmark Berle and Means study, Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932)  anticipating the monopolistic competition revolution, can be regarded as a joint Columbia-Harvard product. The firmest asset in the hands of the Columbia Institutionalists was the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) -- an institute the Chicagoans could not match.  Wesley Mitchell had set this up in 1920 with the help of Harvard's E.F. Gay, but the NBER remained very much Mitchell's baby.  Mitchell directed its research program on the empirical analysis of business cycles.  Despite its nominal independence, research positions at the NBER were filled by Mitchell's students from Columbia, such as Simon Kuznets in 1926, Arthur F. Burns and Solomon Fabricant in 1930, Milton Friedman in 1937 and Moses Abramovitz in 1938.  The crowning achievement of the NBER's research program was Mitchell and Burns's massive study, Measuring Business Cycles (1946).   The Columbia faculty also participated in a variety of advisory roles and sat on government commissions during the New Deal and in wartime planning.  Adolf Berle and Rexford Tugwell were original members of President Roosevelt's ""Brain Trust"" in the 1930s.    For a while, it seemed as if the Columbia Institutionalists might hold on the crown of American economics.  But, in the 1930s,  the Paretian Revival to restore Neoclassical economics got under way.  This was heralded by Schumpeter's arrival at Harvard, pulling it more firmly into the Neoclassical camp.  With the arrival of the Cowles Commission in 1939, the Chicago Neoclassicals finally had a well-funded research institute to rival Columbia's NBER.  Henceforth, Columbia Institutionalists would be fighting a rear-guard action.   The battle reached a fever pitch in 1947-9, when Koopmans pitted Cowles's ""theoretical"" approach to econometrics against the NBER's ""measurement"" approach.    But there was also some ""boring from within"".  Arguably the most important appointment during the 1930s was that of the statistician and mathematical economist Harold Hotelling in 1931 to replace the retired Henry L. Moore.  Hotelling single-handedly carried the flame of the Paretian Revival deep into the heart of enemy territory.   Kenneth J. Arrow, Meyer Girshick, W. Allen Wallis and Milton Friedman were a few of the Columbia students who worked under Hotelling.   Hotelling was intent on creating a separate program for mathematical statistics and secured the appointment of Abraham Wald in 1939 for the purpose.  In 1942, Hotelling formed the wartime ""Statistical Research Group"" (SRG) at Columbia.  The SRG was under contract with the US government to study statistical methods and operations research for war objectives.  Leonard J. Savage joined Hotelling, Wald, and their students at the SRG.  The great outcome of the SRG was the development of Wald's ""sequential analysis"" and statistical decision-making, that would later propel the theory of choice under uncertainty.  The SRG was disbanded after the war and many of its members gravitated to the University of Chicago (they formed the nucleus of the postwar ""Chicago School"").  Although Wald stayed on at Columbia, Hotelling departed for North Carolina. Mitchell's retirement in 1944 dealt a blow to the Institutionalist hold.  Arthur F. Burns (arguably more of a Marshallian than a red-blooded Institutionalist) took over the business cycle courses and the NBER;  John Maurice Clark, who took over Mitchell's standard courses, aimed for a less confrontational position.  Karl Polanyi's arrival in 1947 energized the old guard, but his adjunct position ensured watered down his influence. The appointment of four Neoclassical theorists in 1945-7 period -- Abram Bergson, George J. Stigler, A.G. Hart and William Vickrey -- set the tone for the future.  Ragnar Nurkse arrived around the same time to teach international trade.  General Dwight D. Eisenhower, became president of Columbia around this time, marking another break with the past.  By the late 1950s, with a spate of retirements and departures of interwar Institutionalists, the Neoclassicals had taken a firm hold of the Columbia economics department.

Cornell," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by Cornell University or any other organization. See the official Cornell website]  The youngest of the Ivy League colleges in the United States, Cornell University was founded in 1865, as a land-grant university by New York State, with a substantial additional endowment by Ezra Cornell.  The Morrill Act of 1962 had authorized grants of federal lands to US states to fund the erection of ""agricultural and mechanical colleges"" (loosely defined).  New York State had been allocated some $1.2 million in land-grant funding, and there were competing proposals. In the end, Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White, both of them New York State senators at the time, agreed to combine their efforts into a proposal for a single scheme - what would become Cornell University, chartered in 1865.  Acceptance of the Cornell-White scheme by New York was facilitated by the promise of additional endowment beyond the federal land grant money.  Ezra Cornell was a Quaker farmer who had made a substantial fortune as the leading stockholder of the Western Union telegraph company, and had been looking to deploy it ""for the common good"".  Cornell  pledged $500,000, on the condition that the university would be located in his home town of Ithaca, New York.  Andrew Dickson White, a businessman from Syracuse and former academic (he had previously been professor of history at Michigan), would become the president of the new institution.   White had, in his youth, gone abroad to England, France and Germany (together with Yale classmate Daniel Coit Gilman, later president of Johns Hopkins), and was eager to use the opportunity to translate elements of the modern European university model to American soil. White persuaded Cornell (who had initially envisaged merely some sort of polytechnic school) to endorse this grand direction. Cornell University opened for classes in the Fall of 1868.  Andrew Dickson White served both as president and professor of history at Cornell from the outset.  The professor of moral philosopher, William Dexter Wilson (formerly of Geneva College) was in charge of delivering the dose of economics in the fourth year - which he did with protectionist enthusiasm, placing Henry C. Carey's works as centerpiece through the 1870s.   Cornell faced difficulties in the late 1870s and early 1880s, a period where A.D. White was usually abroad on official US diplomatic missions and leadership drifted.  In 1879, returning briefly from Paris with notes on the Grand Ecoles, White decided to strengthen the social sciences to better train public leaders, and set out a plan to set up a dedicated course of instruction in ""History and Political Science"" (which included economics), and even raise it into a distinct school.  While abroad, White had come across the young Hopkins graduate, Henry C. Adams, and brought him to Cornell in 1880 as a lecturer in political economy (gently and gradually edging the aged Wilson), along with Herbert Tuttle (to teach political science) and the historian Charles Kendall Adams.  The three lecturers would form the core of school. In 1883, they were promoted to associate professors.   After twenty years at the helm, and lured by further diplomatic posts, Andrew Dickson White resigned in 1885 (endowing his substantial private library to the university), and was succeeded by Charles Kendall Adams as president of Cornell.  Under C.K. Adams, the Course of History and Political Science was overhauled and further strengthened, but only after a period of high instability.  For apparently political reasons, Henry C. Adams was forced to resign in 1887 from Cornell and was replaced in the interim by instructor Frank Heywood Hodder. Cornell poached E. Benjamin Andrews from Brown to take over economics teaching in 1888, but he would not stay for long. Called to the presidency of Brown a year later, E.B. Andrews decamped in 1889, and Hodder was once again asked to temporarily fill the gap. The next professor of political economy and finance, J. Laurence Laughlin, arrived in 1890, but he left two years later to take up the leadership at the newly-founded University of Chicago in 1892.  Laughlin took his junior associate Adolph C. Miller and young fellow Thorstein Veblen (both at Cornell since 1891) with him to Chicago.  The president Charles K Adams left Cornell in 1892 to take up the presidency of the University of Wisconsin.  His successor as president, Jacob Gould Schurman, was determined on introducing more stability at Cornell.  Some form of stability finally arrived with Jeremiah W. Jenks.  Hoping to raise the department into a properly distinct school, new courses in Political Institutions, Municipal Institutions and International Law had been introduced in 1887 and were placed originally in the hands of Herbert Tuttle. But Tuttle was inherently a historian, so in 1891, Jeremiah W. Jenks was brought in to take over the political, municipal and social institutions courses, while Tuttle moved sideways to become professor of modern history.  With Laughlin & Miller's departure, Jenks was notionally appointed to take over political economy, but Jenks was absent in Europe on sabbatical for the duration of 1892-93.  To make up the gaps, a crop of younger men were brought in 1892 - Ely student Edward A. Ross (associate in political economy) , Walter F. Willcox (assistant in social science and statistics)  and Charles H. Hull (assistant in institutions).  Ross did not stay long - departing for Stanford in 1893.  So Cornell turned to Hopkins again in 1893, and brought in the promising young economists L.S. Merriam as lecturer and Thomas Nixon Carver as fellow in economics.  But this was also fleeting.  Merriam died tragically in a boating accident within a few months, and Carver, after finishing his Ph.D. at Cornell in 1894, moved on to Oberlin. To replace them, Cornell brought in  Frank A. Fetter, a former Jenks protege, just returning with a German doctorate, but he stayed on for only a year, before moving on to Indiana.  Another Ely student, Charles J. Bullock, newly minted from Wisconsin,  was brought in 1895. Jenks, Willcox, Hull and Bullock gave Cornell economics stability for the rest of the decade. But instability returned in 1899, when Bullock left for Williams College and that same year, Willcox left to work as chief statistician of the Census (he would return in 1901) and Jenks was bogged down with the US Industrial Commission.  C.H. Hull took up the slack temporarily and was offered a full professorship of political economy, but declined  it in favor of a professorship of American history in 1900.  So, in 1901, Cornell lured back  Frank A. Fetter (who had just resigned from Stanford) and appointed him as new professor of political economy and finance in 1901.  The trio of Jenks, Willcox and Fetter dominated Cornell economics for the next decade.  Although Jenks was notionally the senior man and taught a lion's share of courses, he was more interested in political science, and was frequently absent (a friend of President Theodore Roosevelt, Jenks found himself repeatedly appointed to a variety of US commissions which often had him traveling abroad). With Willcox primarily focused on statistics, it is probably fair to say that economic theory at Cornell really boiled down to Frank Fetter during this period.  A thoroughly Neoclassical economist, of Austrian proclivities,  Fetter maintained Cornell as a bastion of Neoclassicism (what Fetter liked to call the ""Psychological School""), while other American universities were gliding into Institutionalism.  In the early part of the century, there two important additions: Edwin W. Kemmerer, a Jenks student who had served as a ""money doctor"" in the Philippines in 1903-06, joined the Cornell faculty in 1906, while Harvard economic historian A.P. Usher joined in 1910 as an instructor in economics. Cornell economics, however, unravelled again in 1912.  J.W. Jenks resigned to take up a position with the Alexander Hamilton Institute, while Fetter and Kemmerer decamped for Princeton.  Alvin S. Johnson (then unhappily at Stanford) was brought in to fill the gap and, supplemented by Allyn Young in 1913, deepened the ""Neoclassicazation"" of the department begun by Fetter.  Johnson left for New York after three years, and was replaced by Herbert J. Davenport in 1916. Herbert J. Davenport would preside over Cornell for many years.  Usher and Young left for Harvard in 1920. From Fetter through Davenport, Cornell remained something of a bastion of Neoclassical theory - the ""Psychological School"" - during a time when most American academics had discarded the theory and universities embraced rising Institutionalism.  In bucking the trend and tending the Neoclassical flame, Cornell would be joined by Chicago in the 1920s, after Frank H. Knight took up his seat there.  The young F.H. Knight had been a student at Cornell during the 1910s, starting out in philosophy, then switching over to economics under the tutelage of Johnson and Young and finishing under Davenport in 1916.  (Going the other way, Sumner Slichter went from Chicago to Cornell in 1920).  Charles F. Roos, who would go on to became the first research director at Cowles, started off as professor of mathematics at Cornell in the 1920s.  It is perhaps fitting that an early champion of American-style Neoclassicism, Benjamin H. Anderson, would finally rest his tired bones at Cornell in the 1940s.

Harvard," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by Harvard University or any other organization. See the official Harvard University website] Harvard is probably the best-known of the elite ""Ivy League"" colleges of the United States.  It certainly is the oldest.  It was founded in 1636 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a Congregationalist seminary by the Massachusetts Bay Company. After the dissolution of the company and the transformation of Massachusetts into a royal colony in 1684, Harvard abandoned its puritanical roots and switched to Unitarianism, a considerably more tolerant religion.  Many of the more conservative members of the college were appalled by the apostasy, and angrily decamped to Connecticut to found a new Congregationalist college.  This new college -- Yale -- would eventually become Harvard's great rival.   .     In the spirit of the times, Harvard gradually evolved out of  its roots as a religious seminary and, by the late 18th Century, had really little more than a ""finishing school"" for the sons of the upper crust of New England society.  Harvard's curriculum followed very much the ""Anglo-Saxon"" model of classical education -- Greek, Latin, rhetoric, logic, mathematics, with a dab of moral philosophy in the final year.  It was very much about building ""character"" and ""moral excellence"", rather than imparting modern practical knowledge.   However, by the mid-19th Century, it was understood that some familiarity with economics was essential for every gentleman-student. In 1853, Francis Bowen, a historian and philosopher, was charged with teaching the first courses in political economy for final year students at Harvard. Amasa Walker was appointed examiner in political economy at Harvard that same year.  However, Bowen's predilections for a ""loose money"" policy -- and his insistence on addressing this in his lectures -- irked the conservative administration. Eventually, in an effort to shield the Harvard undergraduates from Bowen's ""dangerous"" ideas, the grandees of Massachusetts put together enough money to fund a chair in political economy at Harvard (the first separate chair in United States) and handpicked a ""hard money"" man for it, Charles F. Dunbar in 1871.  Dunbar's courses relied primarily on classical texts, like Smith, J.S. Mill, Cairnes and Fawcett. In the mid-19th Century, American universities were under immense pressure to abandon their classical ""Anglo-Saxon"" curriculum and embrace a more modern curriculum of experimental sciences, modern languages, history and social sciences.  The U.S. government stepped into the game with the Morrill Act of 1862, promising federal funds to set up agricultural and technical colleges.  Harvard availed itself of the opportunity by establishing the ""Lawrence Scientific School"", offering a modern, scientifically-minded undergraduate curriculum, but they kept it strictly segregated from the classical Harvard College. But that very same year, a new university was established (also with the help of Morrill money), just down the street -- the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.).  It offered an integrated modern program and seemed to be of much promise.  In 1869, Harvard poached one of M.I.T.'s chemistry professors, Charles W. Eliot, and appointed him president of Harvard. The ambitious Charles W. Eliot sought to transform Harvard from a gentlemen's college into a serious research university along the ""German"" line.  The expansion of economics was an integral part of Eliot's plan.   President Eliot gave Dunbar an assistant, the recently German-minted Silas M. MacVane in 1875.   MacVane moved to history in 1878, and was replaced by J. Laurence Laughlin as instructor in economics. President Eliot went on to establish a graduate research program in economics (albeit with the degrees granted through the political science department).  Throughout the early Dunbar period, economics at Harvard was of the Classical School variety, with a heavy ""apologist"" emphasis. But things were about to change.  In 1875, Stuart Wood, one of Dunbar's students, became the first person in the United States to receive a Ph.D for an economics thesis.  Frank W. Taussig  received the second degree and was appointed a Harvard instructor in 1883.  That same year, Laughlin was formally made assistant professor. In 1886, Eliot encouraged Dunbar to found the Quarterly Journal of Economics in order to raise the research profile of the Harvard economics department.  The QJE was funded by a substantial gift of $15,000 from one of Dunbar's former students.  Laughlin decamped in 1887, and Taussig rose to assistant professor. In 1892, the ""Department of Economics"" was formally established.  That same year, seeing the Dunbar's brand of ""classical"" economics was a bit behind the times, Eliot promoted the Neoclassical-leaning Taussig to full professor.  To further balance the department, the prominent English Historicist, William J.Ashley was brought in as a full professor that very same year. Other junior appointments followed, so by 1893, Harvard  Taussig was to take over the editorship of the QJE in 1896. By 1894-95, Harvard had three full professors (Dunbar, Taussig, Ashley), one assistant professor, three instructors, and offered six full-year courses and seven half-courses.  This curiously balanced triumvirate -- ""classical"" Dunbar, ""neoclassical"" Taussig, and ""historicist"" Ashley -- would jointly preside over the department more-or-less as equals for the next few years.   To bless them all, Eliot allowed the economics department to grant its own advanced degrees in 1894.  In 1897, he finally granted the department a fully separate status. . Hitherto confined to upperclassmen, economics courses were finally offered to first year freshmen in 1899. But everything quickly broke down in 1900-01. In quick succession, Dunbar died, Ashley returned to England, while Taussig suffered a nervous breakdown and took a leave of absence.  With the department thus decimated, Thomas Nixon Carver -- a Neoclassical economist of Austrian propensities, who had been appointed in 1901 to replace Dunbar - found himself the solitary faculty member in the department.  With Eliot's collaboration, Carver (elevated precipitously to full professor, chair and editor of the QJE) promptly set about plugging in the holes.   Three novices, O.M.W. Sprague (a Dunbar student), A. Piatt Andrew and Edwin F. Gay (economic historian, newly minted under Schmoller in Berlin), were appointed as instructors in 1902.  For senior faculty, they lured William Z. Ripley (from M.I.T) as full professor and Charles J. Bullock (from Williams College) as assistant professor (both had already helped fill in temporarily with lectures in 1901-02).      Taussig returned from darkness in late 1903 and was quick to assert his authority over the economics department and the QJE.  It is really from this time onwards that Harvard economics became synonymous with Taussig. Carver's Austrian-inspired curriculum was pushed aside in favor of Taussig's Marshallian strand of Neoclassical economics.  Ripley, the other senior faculty member, veered into sociology. Bullock and Gay, representatives of the budding Institutionalist and Historicist traditions respectively, were too junior to challenge or keep Taussig in check (as Ashley had previously done), and so resorted to carving out detached small corners for themselves. These six - seniors Taussig, Carver, Ripley, and juniors Bullock, Gay and Sprague - would constitute the backbone of the department for the next three decades.  But there is little doubt that Taussig was the paramount chief. Taussig's Principles of Economics (1911) became the bible of the department and one of the most widely-used textbooks in America.    Although things had stabilized a bit after Taussig's return, President Eliot had still not run out of novel schemes.  In 1908, he created the Graduate School of Business Administration, in which the economics department was expected to help out.  Gay was appointed as its head and Sprague joined its faculty.   In 1909, Eliot was replaced as president of Harvard by A. Lawrence Lowell.  President Lowell was an altogether different character.  He felt that Eliot's attempt to transform Harvard into a research university had left its main responsibility -- the teaching of undergraduates -- in the dust.  Lowell set out to rectify this.  Departments were put on notice that they expected more effective teaching and, in 1914, Lowell went so far as to introduce the English ""tutorial"" system into Harvard. America's entry into the First World War in 1917 thinned the department again.  Gay and Taussig departed for appointments in Washington, while Carver went into a slump. In the meantime, C.J. Bullock got distracted - raising money for a empirical research institute.  This became the Committee for Economic Research in 1917.  With the funds, Bullock immediately hired empiricist Warren Persons and the statistician Edward Frickey.  In 1919, Persons introduced a method of measuring and forecasting business cycles that was to become known as the ""Harvard Barometer"".   That same year, Persons, Bullock and Frickey set up ""Harvard Economic Service"", a semi-academic, semi-private forecasting service that employed Persons's barometer.   Harvard's second journal, the Review of Economics and Statistics, founded that same year, was the house journal of the HES.  The statistician, William Leonard Crum, joined the barometer project in 1925.  Teaching, the great priority of President Lowell, suffered in this slow period.  In 1919, a young assistant professor, H.H. Burbank, was given charge of implementing and coordinating the tutorial program (he eventually took over the reigns as chairman of the economics department).  In 1920, Harvard hired a dynamic teacher from Cornell by the name of Allyn Young.  More hires were made in subsequent years, notably the macroeconomist John H. Williams in 1921, the economic historian, A.P. Usher in 1922 and the agricultural economist John D. Black in 1927. As the most effective member of the faculty, Young's teaching and supervisory load was heavy.   Despite his great influence on students, Young could not hold out for long.  In 1926, Young decided to jump ship and head for the L.S.E.  His prize pupil, Edwin H. Chamberlin, submitted his famous dissertation on ""monopolistic competition"" in 1927 and stayed on as part of the Harvard faculty.  Another Harvard Ph.D, Seymour E. Harris, also stayed on. Young's departure was only the beginning of the unraveling of the department that was to follow.  Persons left in 1928, leaving the Harvard Economic Service in the hands of Bullock and Crum.  However, the HES's failure to predict the 1929 downturn for its private customers had soiled its reputation and the Harvard administration was intent on keeping it at arm's length.  The HES was finally dissolved in 1931 and the REStat was folded into the economics department.  Bullock retired soon afterwards.  After three decades, the senior members were also getting on in years -  Ripley and Carver resigned in 1932, while Taussig retired in 1935.  Gay was offered Taussig's chair, but declined and joined the Huntington Library instead, Usher taking over his duties in economic history.  In the meantime, the reigns of the university had passed from President Lowell onto James Bryant Conant in 1933.  What happened next is well-known in economics lore: the arrival of Joseph Schumpeter.  The Austrian economist and Lausanne enthusiast, Schumpeter, had been a recurrent visiting professor at Harvard since 1927.  In 1932, Schumpeter finally took up a permanent appointment (replacing Carver) and eventually replaced Taussig himself as the dominant figure of the department.  Looking to the European Continent rather than the American hinterlands, Schumpeter was instrumental in the hiring of the brilliant Russian emigr√©, Wassily Leontief, in 1931 and of his Austrian comrade-in-arms, Gottfried Haberler in 1936.   In an effort to bring the Paretian Revival to Harvard, Schumpeter, Leontief and Haberler introduced the first courses in Neoclassical economic theory, mathematical economics and modern statistics (some of them taught by the polymath E.B. Wilson from the School of Public Health).  It probably did not hurt that the Harvard sociologist and Pareto enthusiast, Talcott Parsons, had been on the scene at Harvard since 1927.  Schumpeter participated in the famous ""Pareto Seminar"" set up by Parsons and his colleagues in 1935.  That same year, Leontief established his ""Price Analysis"" (i.e. mathematical economics) course.  In 1941, Leontief single-handedly launched his own quantitative revolution with the creation of ""input-output"" analysis.    But Harvard had other revolutions going on.  In 1933, Edwin H. Chamberlin, finally published his Theory of Monopolistic Competition, proposing the completely recast the theory of value and causing quite a flurry in the economics world.   Junior faculty members and students, such as Edward S. Mason, Joe S. Bain and Paul Sweezy, kept the monopolistic competition revolution going.  It was during this time that the rivalry between Chicago and Harvard really heated up -- with Frank Knight leading the charge against the Chamberlinians. There were other new appointments worth noting.  Labor economist Sumner H. Slichter joined the Harvard faculty in 1930.   The Harvard School of Public Administration was created in 1936.  John H. Williams was appointed its first dean and Alvin H. Hansen, soon to become the acknowledged leader of the Keynesian Revolution in America, was hired through it in 1937.  Seymour E. Harris also jumped on the Keynesian bandwagon. Harvard of the late 1930s was blessed with a ""golden generation"" of junior faculty and students -- including John Kenneth Galbraith, the brothers Alan and Paul Sweezy, Richard Goodwin, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, Lloyd Metzler, Arthur Smithies, Sidney Alexander, John Lintner, David McCord Wright, Abram Bergson, James Tobin, Richard Musgrave, Robert Triffin, James S. Duesenberry, Robert Solow, Robert Heilbroner, Wolfgang Stolper, Shigeto Tsuru, Henry Wallich, and the supreme wunderkind, Paul Samuelson.  Many of them came into Schumpeter's charismatic orbit, absorbed Leontief's mathematics and were charged up by Hansen's Keynesianism.   However, Depression exigencies required that the department also be slimmed -- and the junior faculty took the chop.  In 1937, the department recommended junior faculty members Raymond Walsh and Alan Sweezy for re-appointment until tenure evaluation down the track, but the administration denied their request.  The ""Walsh-Sweezy"" case generated much uproar, both within and without Harvard, as many felt that these two quite active, left-wing economists were being targeted by the powers-that-be for political reasons.  After years of wrangling, a resolution was reached which exonerated the administration.   One result of the Walsh-Sweezy case was the institutionalization of President Conant's ""up-or-out"" policy:  the stipulation that within eight years, a junior faculty member must earn tenure or else he must leave; there would be no ""eternal"" junior appointments.   Also, Harvard switched from its old notorious policy of  ""only hiring your own"" to its new (and equally notorious) policy of ""never hiring your own"".   The attempt by the overseeing brahmins of Harvard University in the 1940s to ""re-balance"" what they perceived as a department that had grown too leftist, too theoretical and too Jewish too quickly, took in other casualties. Perhaps the most famous case was that of Paul Samuelson who would, under different circumstances, have been a shoo-in to join the Harvard faculty.  Surprisingly, there was opposition to Samuelson's appointment in 1940, some of it allegedly based on unsavory religious bigotry. (Seymour Harris, then the only Jewish member of the faculty, had to wait eighteen years for tenure.)  Samuelson decamped across the street to M.I.T. and never looked back (well, he looked back once in 1947, when a position opened up again  at Harvard, but was passed over again, in favor of Arthur Smithies).  Promising junior Harvard economists, such as Paul Sweezy and Richard Goodwin, departed for new and better things. Attempts to deny Galbraith tenure failed only because they could not find someone else - John D. Black was approaching retirement and agricultural economics (then a large chunk of Harvard's economics course offerings) would have been left unmanned. Interestingly, practically no senior Harvard faculty had sat on President Roosevelt's ""Brain Trust"" in the 1930s.  Some who had been previously involved in government (e.g. Sprague) openly denounced the public policy revolution in Washington.  However,  the junior members of the faculty -- like Currie, Harris, Galbraith and Sweezy -- were heavily involved in the New Deal and wartime administration.   Harvard's ""golden generation"" students (e.g. Samuelson, Tobin, Solow, etc.) were also prominent theorists and policy analysts in the post-war ""Neoclassical-Keynesian Synthesis"".   The public policy influence of the golden generation was at its height in the Kennedy administration of the early 1960s.

Johns Hopkins," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the Johns Hopkins University or any other organization. See the official Johns Hopkins University website] The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, was probably the first research university in the United States.  It was founded in 1876 by Johns Hopkins, a wealthy Quaker businessman, with Baltimore & Ohio Railroad stock.  Its first president, Daniel Coit Gilman was primarily responsible for setting it up on the ""German"" seminar model of serious research for earned advanced degrees, like the Ph.D.    From the outset in 1876, economics was planned into the curriculum of the Department of Moral and Historical Sciences.  Francis A. Walker was tapped to be its first permanent professor of political economy, but he declined the offer, taking on a visiting position instead.  Feelers were placed out to several others, but, until the 1880s, Ph.D. students in economics had to live off a diet offered by visiting scholars.  The first economics Ph.D. at Hopkins was awarded to Henry Carter Adams in 1878. In 1881, getting quite desperate, Gilman appointed two young instructors on a full-time basis -- Richard T. Ely and Herbert Baxter Adams (no relation to H.C. Adams).   Ely and Adams were both the ""New Generation"" of American economists, both trained in the German Historical School tradition at Heidelberg under Karl Knies.  Ely and Adams immediately set the historicist tone of the department and attracted  numerous graduate students.  The crop of graduate students produced by Ely and Adams in the 1880s went on to populate the chairs in economics that were finally beginning to emerge at colleges and universities across the United States.  Economics was rewarded by being given partial autonomy in 1889. Keen for participation by senior faculty, Gilman tried to cajole the Hopkins mathematician and astronomer Simon Newcomb to teach courses in political economy.  However Newcomb, an early convert to Neoclassicism and a prominent ""apologist"", was not disposed to accommodate himself with the young historicists.  A bruising, internal Methodenstreit followed.  In 1884-5, Newcomb publicly (and privately) attacked Ely and the historical method.  Ely was suspicious that President Gilman, a friend of Newcomb's, might start listening and get rid of him.  Knowing that Gilman was hungry to put Johns Hopkins on the map, Ely called upon his network of like-minded, German-trained ""New Generation"" economists and set up the American Economic Association in 1885.  Ely's capital move was to harness general Francis Aamasa Walker, the dean of American economics, into his ring.  It certainly impressed Gilman.    However, in 1885-6, Newcomb and Ely were at each other's throats again.  Ely directed his students to review Newcomb's books unfavorably, while Newcomb (an examiner on the economics Ph.D committee) continued to communicate to Gilman his irritation at finding Ely's students so ""unscientifically"" trained.  In the summer of 1886, Newcomb and Ely exchanged public blows with each other in the pages of Science magazine.  For the first time, Newcomb accused Ely openly of being a ""socialist"".  Ely did not deny the charge.  After the Haymarket Riots of 1886, economists were called upon to take sides on the ""labor question"". Ely and his students defended the labor movement. Newcomb lined himself up immediately against them and publicly accused Ely of being ""unfit"" to hold a university chair.  Given the mood of the times, Ely's days seemed numbered.  Nonethelesss, Gilman promoted him to associate professor and, in turn, Ely toned down his socialist rhetoric. The creation of Chicago and Stanford in the early 1890s seemed to strengthen Ely's position, with his Hopkins students being much courted by the new research universities. Emboldened, Ely demanded tenure and the autonomy of the economics department at Johns Hopkins.  President Gilman refused and, in early 1892, Ely resigned and left for the University of Wisconsin -- taking a string of graduate students with him, including William A. Scott, David Kinley and Charles J. Bullock. (another student, Frederick Jackson Turner, had gone on ahead was instrumental in securing Wisconsin's invitation to Ely). Sidney Sherwood, a Hopkins Ph.D. and recent convert to the marginalist revolution, took over the chairmanship and began to draw the department away from its radical historicist roots.  To stop the haemorrhage occasioned by Ely's departure, John Bates Clark from Smith College and Henry C. Adams from Michigan were lured in 1892 as visiting professors.   That same year, Simon Newcomb crossed the border and gave a series of lectures on mathematical economics. Sherwood promptly organized a study group (which included J.H. Hollander, T.N.Carver, D.I. Green and others) to examine the new works of Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk and Alfred Marshall.  Henry L. Moore, a student of Newcomb and Clark, began as an instructor in the department in 1896. Hopkins was unable to hold on to J.B. Clark, who took up a position at Columbia in 1895.  H.L. Moore left for Smith College in 1898.  Dana Durand and W.F. Willoughby were appointed in 1900, but the changing of the guard really only began in 1901, with the retirement of President Gilman and the untimely deaths of economist Sherwood and historian Henry Baxter Adams.  That same year, the economics department was finally granted a separate existence and two Hopkins Ph.Ds, Jacob H. Hollander and George E. Barnett took charge of the department.  In 1904, almost thirty years after its creation and after 579 economics Ph.Ds had been granted, the Johns Hopkins University finally got around to appointing its first full Professor of Political Economy.  The honor fell upon Jacob Hollander. However, by the early 1900s, the glory days of Johns Hopkins were clearly in the past.  Columbia and Wisconsin had surged ahead in the production of the next generation, while Harvard, Chicago and Cornell were not far behind.  Nonetheless, Hopkins-trained economists continued to dominate the American economics scene long after Hopkins itself had lost its monopoly on student-creation.   Hollander's baton was passed on to George H. Evans in the interwar period.  Johns Hopkins got a second lease on life after the Second World War, with the a slate of exciting new appointments -- particularly Fritz Machlup and Evsey Domar in 1948.  The empirical side was strengthened with the appointment of Simon Kuznets and Carl Christ in the 1950s.   The departure of Machlup, Kuznets and Domar circa 1960 led to a transition period in the department, although the appointments of Musgrave, Lancaster and Adelman helped hold the ship together.  The late 1960s saw the appointment of a new generation --  Bela Balassa, J√ºrg Niehans, Peter Newman,  Hugh Rose and others, who were to guide the department for the next couple of decades.

M.I.T.," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or any other organization. See the official M.I.T. website]. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is one of the best-known independent technical universities in the United States.  Although its economics department is of relatively recent vintage (established really only in 1933), MIT would ascend rapidly after WWII to become one of the leading economics programs in the United States, and arguably the most influential in shaping postwar economics. The origins of MIT are traced much earlier.  In 1862, Congress passed the Morrill Act providing federal subsidies for the establishment of ""Colleges for the benefit of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts.""  Technical colleges of this kind sprouted up, but mostly as appendages to existing universities (e.g. Sheffield Scientific School at Yale, the College of Agriculture at Wisconsin, etc.)  So when the geologist William Barton Rogers began floating the idea of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) among New England industrialists, the response was noticeably lukewarm.  Many believed that M.I.T. might be better served if it were merely a technical ""division"" of an existing school (Harvard was the usual suggestion).  However, Rogers insisted that M.I.T. ought to be ""self-contained"" school, that even though it might specialize in modern technical subjects, it would provide a ""complete"" education (with basic science, liberal arts, humanities, etc.)  At the outset, MIT's objective was not the advancement of scientific research per se (like Hopkins and other new research-oriented schools), but rather more practical:  ""a polytechnic school of the useful arts""  to provide trained engineers and technicians for private industry.  To that end, a wider ""cultural"" component, which included a familiarity with economics, was seen as necessary for the complete education of an engineer. M.I.T. was incorporated in 1861, and, after some difficulty in raising funds and hiring ten full professors, finally opened its doors to students in 1865.   The State of Massachusetts chipped in by dividing its federal appropriations from the Morrill Act - 70% went towards the Agricultural College in Amherst (future University of Massachusetts-Amherst), and 30% towards the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The course offerings at MIT, from the outset, consisted entirely of ""modern"" subjects:  geology,  physics, chemistry, metallurgy, mathematics, engineering, literature, modern languages, philosophy, history, political science and economics.  All students were expected to get a little bit of everything before specializing in any technical subjects.  For those wishing to specialize in the social sciences or humanities, rather than the technical subjects, there was a tailored program for them known as ""Course IX"".  The economics  portion of Course IX - which, by the early 1870s, consisted of classes in political economy, economic history, industrial geography and business law - were primarily in the hands of the all-around humanities lecturer, William Parsons Atkinson.  The overburdened Atkinson pleaded for assistance, so in 1873,  the ""Course of Philosophy"" was separated from Course IX and created into its own, second non-technical concentration, and philosopher George H. Howison hired to teach it.  Howison was also given the responsibility of assisting with the economics classes of Course IX, taking some of the burden off Atkinson.   Financial difficulties continued for a while and President Rogers faced an enormous challenge in keeping M.I.T. going.   In 1869, Harvard poached Charles W. Eliot, M.I.T's professor of chemistry and made him their president.  Inspired by his experience at M.I.T., Eliot sought to transform Harvard into a ""modern"" research university.  Eliot also envisaged that Harvard would eventually ""absorb"" M.I.T. and began making overtures to this end.  But MIT president Rogers and his successor after 1870, John D. Runkle, were adamant in their resistance. Still, MIT fortunes suffered heavily during the 1870s depression, and by 1878, they had to put an end to the Philosophy course, folding everything back into Atkinson's lap. In 1874, the economics classes in Course IX, previously obligatory, were made optional for technical students. In 1881, the forty-one-year-old Yale economist Francis Amasa Walker was elected by the trustees as the third president of M.I.T.  Upon his ascension, Walker immediately took over the responsibility for the economics courses himself, releasing Atkinson to concentrate on literature and history.  Walker made economics classes a requirement again for all technical students.  Walker's inclination to empirical work led him to hire Davis Rich Dewey, a Hopkins-trained ""new generation"" historicist (and older brother of John Dewey), in 1886 for Course IX (now renamed the ""Course of General Studies"").  As Walker's administrative responsibilities increased, Dewey gradually took over the economics courses.  In 1888, another Hopkins-trained historicist Charles H. Levermore, was hired to replace the retiring Atkinson in history.. Levermore left in 1893 to take up the presidency of Adelphi, so the German-trained historian Charles F.A. Currier was brought in to replace him.  Later that same year, 1893, William Z. Ripley, a former MIT and Columbia-trained engineer-economist was brought in to teach political science.  William Niles was hired to take over geography. [For the record, under Walker's tenure, the MIT courses of 1890-91 were: I. civil and topographic engineering, II. mechanical engineering, III. mining engineering and metallurgy, IV. architecture, V. chemistry, VI. electrical engineering, VII. biology, VIII. physics, IX. general studies, X. chemical engineering, XI. sanitary engineering, XII. geology.] By the time Walker died in 1897, Course IX was flourishing under the triumvirate of Dewey, Ripley and Niles.  But the new president James Mason Craft, a chemist, took little interest in it.  Things changed dramatically when president Henry Smith Pritchett took the throne in 1900.  Unlike his predecessors, Pritchett was receptive to Eliot's overtures for a merger of MIT with Harvard, but could not persuade the faculty to go along with it (eventually it would take a Massachusetts court decision in 1905 to put an end to the plan).  Pritchett also saw little value in Course IX, and decided to reorganize it.  By 1903, the softer, literary and humanistic portions were quashed, while the social sciences were reorganized to focus more intently on applied economics and empiricism that might be useful the engineers in private industry.  Anticipating this state of affairs, Ripley decamped for Harvard in 1902, leaving Dewey saddled as the solitary teacher of economics, statistics and political science, with Currier shunted off to a separate department of history.  Carroll W. Doten was brought in 1903 to replace Ripley.  The introductory course in political economy remained obligatory, but by 1906, elective course offerings were reduced from fourteen to six - three by Dewey (banking & finance, industrial organization, economics of corporations) and three by Doten (railroad economics, labor problems, economic history).  In 1907, it was reorganized again, and political science moved to history under Currier, leaving Dewey and Doten as the denizens of a department of economics and statistics.. Pritchett resigned in 1908 and the new MIT president Richard C. Maclaurin revived the value of the ""cultural component"" and gave Dewey some more rope.  In a notable development, in 1914, at the urging of Harold Pender, head of electrical engineering, Maclaurin authorized Dewey to expand his ""Economics of Corporations"" class into a new concentration, the ""Course of Engineering Administration"" (Course XV), effectively a course in business administration for engineering students entering the private sector that would likely ascend to the role of business managers later in their careers.  Course XV would add a master's program in 1925, and be separated from Economics and Statistics in 1930 into its own department (""Business and Engineering Administration"")  Course XV would eventually evolve into MIT's Sloan School of Management by 1950. In 1918, Currier became ill and retired, and the department of history and political science was wound up and folded into English and Humanities. MIT's rise to prominence began with the appointment of president Karl Compton in 1930.  Compton, in conjunction with provost Vannevar Provost, were determined to change the character of MIT from a technical engineering school to a science and research powerhouse.  They modified the structure of the curriculum to place more emphasis on basic science and academics.  The long-time economics chief  Davis Dewey retired in 1933, and was replaced by Ralph Evans Freeman as head of Economics and Social Science and Erwin Schell as head of Business Administration.  They would both preside for similarly long stretches.   Freeman's ambitions dovetaled into the Compton-Bush vision, and the beginning of the ""Department of Economics and Social Science"" at MIT is normally dated to Freeman's ascension in 1933. MIT was transformed by World War II.  But the groundwork was laid even before then.  In 1938, provost Vannevar Bush took up the position as head of the Carnegie Institution in Washington. After the outbreak of war in Europe, Bush persuaded president Franklin Delano Roosevelt to establish the National Defence Research Committee (NRDC) in June 1940, with himself as chair, and including MIT president Karl Compton and Harvard president James B. Conant.  Anticipating US involvement in the war, and remembering the discoordinated efforts during WWI,  the objective was to put civilian science at the disposal of the US military in the development of new weapons.  Rather than the military having to hire scientists and set up their own labs, the NDRC was to serve as the interface between the US military and scattered civilian scientists working at their home institutions. The NDRC was initially endowed with small amount of funds from the president's emergency budget (thus making it independent of Congress and the Departments of War or Navy).  The NDRC would distribute funds on the basis of ""project contracts"" - this was seen as a compromise between having the scientists be under direct military supervision (as the military wanted) and just handing over money to the institutions (as the academics wanted).. Picking project contracts at its discretion gave the NRDC a substantial amount of influence in directing the overall research efforts of scientists across the country. The NDRC helped set up the famous Radiation Laboratory (""Rad Lab"") at MIT in November 1940, to research the development of radar.  A year later, in July 1941, the NDRC was superseded by the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), a government agency directed by Vannevar Bush, with a much larger budget and mandate . MIT's Rad Lab would be the beneficiary of over a third of the OSDR's research funding during WWII.  This allowed the great expansion and deepening of research at MIT, enabling it to emerge from the war as one of the premier universities in the United States. MIT's rise to prominence began with the hiring of Paul Samuelson in 1940, the wunderkind, then serving as a lowly instructor at Harvard.. The Ph.D. program in economics was established in 1941 and Lawrence Klein became the first student to earn a Ph.D. in economics from MIT in 1944.  Samuelson's Economics textbook came out in 1948 (same year as Claude Shannon's groundbreaking ""Mathematical Theory of Communication"").  The Sloan School of Management was formally launched in 1950.

New School," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the New School for Social Research or any other organization. See the official New School website]  The New School for Social Research was founded in 1918 in New York City by a group of prominent Columbia scholars - John Dewey, James Robinson, Charles A. Beard and Wesley C. Mitchell among others - dissatisfied with the state of academic freedom and the state of education in the United States and looking to recreate an American equivalent of the London School of Economics. Thorstein Veblen, who had in part inspired this rebellious group of scholars with his Higher Learning in America (1918), joined soon after and was accompanied by two more economists, the labor statistician Leo Wolman and the economist Alvin S. Johnson. In its early years, the New School emphasized a ""progressive"" adult education as well as an independent social science research institute. It quickly became a regular address for prominent lecturers. John Maynard Keynes and Harold Laski were among the visiting economists in these years. Alvin Johnson, who took over as director in 1922, reorganized the New School, moved it to 12th Street in the thriving Greenwich Village bohemia of New York and expanded its role as a lecture forum. During this time, it moved away from research and more into adult education and fine arts. But this was soon to change. Johnson's work on the Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences during the late 1920s with Edwin Seligman, a prominent Institutionalist economist and early patron of the New School, began to bring research back into prominence. With Johnson's blessing, the New School hosted the Economic Forum, a journal founded in 1932, which served as a haven for heterodox academic and non-academic economists for some time.  The Forum drew contributions from J.M. Keynes, W.T. Foster,  Frank D. Graham, Benjamin Graham, John R. Commons, A.A. Berle, C.H. Douglas, Fredrick Soddy, Sir Josiah Stamp, Bertil Ohlin, Erik Lindahl, Paul Sweezy, etc. that would not likely pass the gatekeepers of orthodox American journals, until it was wrapped up in 1937. Through the Encyclopedia, Johnson came in contact with many German scholars and quickly realized that the imminent rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party threatened to decimate the academic establishment of that country. Working closely with the Berlin economist Emil Lederer, Johnson helped found the ""University in Exile"" to accommodate the newly displaced and exiled German scholars. The University in Exile, which was later to become the Graduate Faculty for Political and Social Science of the New School, was a haven for many and, once again, the New School dedicated itself to scholarly research, quickly becoming one of the more prominent schools of social science in the United States. Emil Lederer, Hans Staudinger, Hans Speier, Frieda Wunderlich and Eduard Heimann were among the German economists who arrived at the Graduate Faculty. The New School also virtually transplanted the entire Kiel Institute of economists - which included its head, Adolph Lowe as well as Jacob Marschak, Hans Neisser and Gerhard Colm. The Kiel Institute was recast under the New School as the ""Institute of World Affairs"" in 1942.  Marschak, in turn, had gone on to hold his NBER-sponsored ""Mathematical Economics"" seminars which became the nucleus of the Cowles Commission. During this time, the L.S.E.-trained Abba Lerner and a young Italian economics student, Franco Modigliani had also joined the New School. The refugee wave continued, particularly after the Austrian Anchluss and the onset of the War was netted by the Graduate Faculty. Among non-economists, the New School acquired the Gestalt psychologist Max Werthheimer, sociologist Max Ascoli, philosopher Leo Strauss, political scientist Max Lerner and the dramatist Erwin Piscator. The fall of France and the Benelux countries had led to the formation of the Ecole Libre des Haute Etudes, which housed prominent French thinkers such as Jacques Maritain and Claude Levi-Strauss and was, during the war, a haven for anti-Vichy activity. The post-war years were made difficult for the New School by the return of scholars back to Europe or their move to other American universities. Although some economists, such as Lowe and Neisser stayed on, others, such as Marschak and Lerner, moved on to other schools. The McCarthyist hysteria of the 1950s strained the New School's resources even further. An injection of life was brought back with the arrival of the philosophers Hans Jonas and Hannah Arendt. In economics, Sidney Weintraub and Paul H. Douglas found a temporary haven, while Robert L. Heilbroner was elevated from Lowe's student to Lowe's colleague. In the 1970s, further appointments were made: Edward J. Nell, Anwar Shaikh and David M. Gordon arrived at the New School, bringing with them their respective research programs in Post Keynesian, Marxian and radical political economy. The Cambridge connection was reinforced by the arrival of John Eatwell as part- time professor in 1982.  In the 1990s,  Lance Taylor and Duncan Foley joined the New School economics department and the Center for Economic Policy Analysis (CEPA) was founded  to further the links between the New School's unique and refreshing perspective and the economic world.

Pennsylvania," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the University of Pennsylvania or any other organization. See the official University of Pennsylvania website] The University of Pennsylvania was founded on the initiative of Benjamin Franklin.  Franklin's 1749 pamphlet, Proposals for the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania, laid down a plan to found a new model college in Pennsylvania. Eschewing the model of Harvard, Yale and William & Mary, which were directed to training clergy and classics, Franklin proposed a college without religious tests, a modern curriculum of useful topics (natural history, moral philosophy, geography, geology), classes taught in English (rather than Latin), and each subject taught by an expert in the field (rather than a single teacher for all subjects).  However, Franklin was not (yet) aiming for a university, but only for an academy for younger children.  The pamphlet led to the assembling of trustees in November 1749, which composed the constitutions for an Academy of Philadelphia and a conjoined Charity School. Both institutions were finally opened in August 1751, in an unutilized schoolhouse built back in 1740 for a Great Awakening-type school (the 1740 date has been misleadingly utilized by some Penn propagandists as a founding date to pip Princeton and Columbia in age). The Penn family, the proprietors of the colony, granted charters to the Academy & Charity school in 1753. The university proper,  the College of Philadelphia, for higher-level education, was only created in 1755. It was founded at the urging of William Smith, a teacher at the Academy, who persuaded Franklin and the trustees that his graduating students were ready for college-level education.  Although the College notionally retained its non-denominational promise, Franklin's departure for Europe in 1757 left the fledgling college in the hands of other trustees, who began to give it a more decidedly Anglican/Episcopalian makeover.  A medical school was added in 1765.  During the American revolution, the College of Philadelphia was suspected as a hotbed of loyalist sentiment so in 1779, the Pennsylvania state authorities took over the college, purged its faculty and trustees, and recast it as the ""University of the State of Pennsylvania"".  After a decade of wrangling, the College was restored in 1789 under its old 1755 charter and its former teachers reappointed, while the University of the State moved to a different location. The difficulty of maintaining two similar institutions in the same city prompted a merger in 1791 between the 1755 College and the 1779 University of State, into a single ""University of Pennsylvania"".   The first century of the University of Pennsylvania was rather non-descript.  Its college remained small, the university being largely dominated by its medical school and later its law school.  Since 1837, a small dollop of classical British economics was offered in the general moral philosophy diet supplied by the provost Henry Vethake.  However, Vethake's peddling of Ricardian free trade dogmas was not well-received in a city which had given birth to the protectionist movement.  The business community was much enamored with its famous son, Henry Carey, and viewed Penn with suspicion. Gradually, via their positions on the board of trustees, Philadelphia industrialists began to push for reforms in the university's curriculum which would allow them to insert their favored economic dogmas.   They succeeded in displacing Vethake by 1860, and by 1870 had instituted a new curriculum of social sciences (required for all students). A firmly Carey-based economics was delivered by Robert Ellis Thompson, Penn's Professor of Social Sciences from 1874. The ascension of the energetic William Pepper as Provost in 1881 would be accompanied by reforms that changed the archaic character of the University of Pennsylvania. A graduate ""School of Philosophy"", offering earned Ph.D. degrees on the German model, was formed in 1881. That same year, Penn accepted an offer of $100,000 from  Philadelphia industrialist Joseph Wharton (a Carey disciple) to found a school for the training of businessmen and political leaders.  The result was the Wharton School of Finance and Economy (later changed to ""Finance and Commerce""), which would become America's first (and for quite some time only) business school.  But Wharton's scheme, initially to reinforce Thompson, was changed in the hands of Pepper, who was eager to the eject the rickety Careyite heritage and embrace a more modern economics.  Under Pepper's direction, both the Graduate School and Wharton promptly capitalized on the ""new generation"" of American economists returning from graduate study in Germany.  The first to arrive was Edmund J. James in 1883, breaking Thompson's monopoly (who subsequently became professor of history and English literature).  However, James had little inclination to teach general economics, preferring to focus on applied topics, leaving much of the lecturing on economics to Thompson.  But student dissatisfaction prompted the shifting out of Thompson and the hiring of Simon Nelson Patten, to take on the economics load.. Recommended by James (they had studied together in Halle), Patten seemed to fit the bill - trained in Germany to satisfy Pepper, with sufficient protectionist credentials to satisfy the industrialist trustees..  Other economists would soon arrive, most of them also German-trained - Roland P. Falkner in 1888, James Harvey Robinson and Albert S. Bolles in 1891, Sidney Sherwood (also 1891, but only one year),  Emory R. Johnson in 1893,  Joseph French Johnson (also 1893, but only for a year). In addition, there were appointments of S.M. Lindsay in sociology and Leo S. Rowe in political science in 1894. The Penn economists founded the American Academy of Political and Social Science in 1889, in conjunction with professors in other local Pennsylvania colleges, like Bryn Mawr and Swarthmore.  For a time, the Annals of the AAPSS almost served as the house journal of the Penn economists.  When James left for Chicago in 1896, Patten succeeded as the chairman of Wharton and editor of the Annals.   Henry R. Seager and James T. Young were appointed in 1896, carrying some of the weight left by James.  Penn graduate Edward S. Meade joined the faculty in 1900.  The early marginalist Stuart Wood, although not at Penn but in the private sector, was a resident in Philadelphia throughout this time and was involved in the activities of the Penn economists and the AAPSS.  The Austrian-inclined Philadelphia engineer Charles W. MacFarlane was also in the vicinity, and studied briefly at Penn. Simon Nelson Patten was without the doubt the leading figure at Pennsylvania during these decades, and set the tone for the economics program, grooming a generation of students, many of whom would become leading Progressives.   Up to this stage, Wharton was merely a set of courses and faculty had appointments elsewhere.  After two years of conventional courses in liberal arts in the college, undergraduate students could turn to complete their degrees with Wharton courses. It was really only after 1904 that Wharton had its own faculty, and only in 1912 was it finally given autonomy from the college. Things would soon change, as Philadelphia industrialists lost interest in protectionism and grew more worried about crop of progressives being turned out by Patten & Co.  Penn was embroiled in a controversy in 1915 over academic freedom when the trustees engineered the dismissal of assistant professor of economics Scott Nearing (a Patten protege) for his outspokeness on child labor, wealth inequality and social reform.  The Penn faculty and the fledgling AAUP, which had only been formed six months earlier, took up the cudgels for Nearing, but could not get the decision reversed.  The trustees continued their purge of the progressives with the dismissal of Patten himself in 1917 - more precisely, they refused to allow him to stay on after reaching the official retirement age of 65. Pennsylvania lost some of its stature and energy with Patten's departure.  Transportation expert Emory Johnson, who had joined Penn in 1896, became dean of Wharton in 1919, a position he would hold until 1933, presided over a quieter but unremarkable transition period.

Princeton," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by Princeton University or any other organization. See the official Princeton University website.] Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey, is one of the √©lite ""Ivy League"" colleges of the United States. It was originally set up in 1746 as a Presbyterian seminary, known as the ""College of New Jersey"", its official name until 1896. Princeton claims itself the successor of the ""Log College"", a Presbyterian seminary set up in 1726 by William Tennent in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, around the time of the ""Great Awakening"", a period of religious revival in the American colonies.  The Log College sought to train Awakening-style preachers and ministers, as a revivalist antidote to the more conventional ministers coming out of the established colleges of Harvard and Yale.  Controversy over the Log College led to a schism within the American Presbyterian Church in 1741, between ""Old Side"" and ""New Side""churches.  After Tennant's death in 1746, the Log College was closed, and the New Side Synod sought a replacement.  A school was erected under pastor James Dickinson in Elizabethtown, NJ, and given a charter as the ""College of New Jersey"" in October 1746 by the New Jersey colonial governor. This is formally counted as the university's founding date.  However, Dickinson died that same month, and the students moved to Newark in 1747, placing themselves under the tutelage of Aaron Burr, a Newark pastor.  A board was organized at a meeting in New Brunswick a year later, and a fresh charter granted by governor Belcher in November 1748.  The Synod launched a concerted campaign to collect donations  from congregations around America to support the college.  New Sider activists Gilbert Tennent and Samuel Davies were sent in 1752 to raise funds in Europe (England, Scotland, Ireland, etc.).  Finally, in 1753, the college received a donation of land  from Nathaniel FitzRandolph in the small town of Princeton (est. 1696), and the erection of buildings on the site began shortly after.  Its first permanent building, Nassau Hall, was finished in 1756, and the college transferred from Newark to Princeton in 1756.  However, Burr died in late 1757, and after some difficulties finding a new president (Great Awakening preacher Jonathan Edwards served for three months before his death), the College appointed Samuel Davies in 1759.  But the College's bad luck with short-lived presidents continued (Davis died in 1761).  Things only finally settled in 1768, with the appointment of Scottish cleric John Witherspoon to assume the presidency of the College.  Witherspoon had been trained at the University of Edinburgh, and was a prominent figure in the established Presbyterian Kirk of Scotland.  But Witherspoon found the environment in Scotland, then under the growing liberal winds of the Scottish Enlightenment, increasingly to his distaste.  Witherspoon was a leader of the older  ""popular faction"" of fire-and-brimstone Calvinism in the Scottish Kirk against the liberalizing reforms pushed by the more elitist ""moderate faction"" (pushed by Hutcheson and his Glasgow students, like Adam Smith).  Feeling he was losing ground, Witherspoon decamped for America to take up the presidency of Princeton. Despite his opposition to the Scottish Enlightenment writers, Witherspoon nonetheless re-cast Princeton in the Scottish mould, modeling the university's structure and curriculum after that of Edinburgh, and presided over a period of flowering for the next few decades. Graduate School established in 1900.  It was only in 1969 that Princeton admitted women into its undergraduate program.

Stanford," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by Stanford University or any other organization. See the official Stanford University website] Stanford University was created by Leland Stanford, a California railroad tycoon, controversial founding executive of Central Pacific and president of Southern Pacific. It was named after his son, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever in 1884. Long-interested in technical education, Stanford had originally thought about expanding the endowment of the University of California at Berkeley.  However, the dismissal  (for political reasons) of his candidacy as regent of the California board, prompted him to decide to set up his own private university. After some investigation, Stanford decided on adopting a mixture of a technical school for vocational studies and a German-style research university model, then exemplified at The Johns Hopkins University.  He tried to lure Francis A. Walker from MIT, but to no avail, so Stanford appointed David Starr Jordan (then the energetic young president of Indiana University) as president of his new university.  With a substantial endowment (estimated at around $20 million), construction of Stanford began in 1887 and classes opened in 1891.  Leland Stanford himself was involved in teaching, conducting extension lectures for local California farmers.  Originally regarded as an ostentatious vanity project of an eccentric tycoon, the project was mocked in the California press, who predicted empty lecture halls in the middle of the rural fields of Palo Alto.  But Stanford's university was was well-launched - the absence of tuition fees helped it gain a critical mass of students almost immediately and frighten neighboring Berkeley with competition for enrollments.  Economics courses were offered from the start, as part of the social sciences (which included political science and sociology).  But unable to lure scholars from the east, instruction was initially undertaken by administrator Orrin Leslie Elliot.  The economics and social sciences department was soon bolstered by the arrival of Amos G. Warner in 1892 and Edwin A. Ross in 1893, both of them Ely students from Hopkins.     Leland Stanford's death in 1893 provoked a little crisis.  The US government froze all of Leland Stanford's property and funds pending the court inquiry into his debts.  As the transfer to the university's endowment was still not finalized, that left the university with zero income.  The economic lurch was solved by Stanford's widow, Jane Stanford (the only trustee), who quickly hired all the faculty professors as her ""private servants"", allowing them to be paid out of the allowance released for her maintenance.  It was a temporary solution, and kept the university on a constrained budget, until the injection of funds raised from sale of Central Pacific stock in 1898.  But even then, at Mrs. Stanford's insistence, much of it was dedicated to construction of new buildings, thus keeping faculty on an austerity diet for a little while longer.  The economics department faced severe growing pains.  By the late 1890s,  Warner had fallen ill and Ross gravitated to sociology, prompting Jordan to hire Frank Fetter and E. Dana Durand in 1898 and assistant Morris Aldrich in 1899 to fill the gaps in the economics courses.  But things were made more difficult by Mrs. Stanford's distaste for Ross. The outspoken E.A. Ross had made controversial pronouncements in the public press - promoting bimetallism, endorsing W.J. Bryan's presidential candidacy, lambasting Chinese immigrants, calling for immigration restrictions, municipal ownership of transportation, etc..  The angered Mrs. Stanford demoted Ross and soon began pressing for his dismissal.  Given the precarious state of economics, Jordan resisted, but eventually relented and forced Ross to resign in 1901.  The ""Ross affair"" became a celebrated case of academic freedom.  Seven faculty members - including Fetter and Aldrich - promptly resigned. The action drew protests from other academics and the press, and Stanford quickly became tainted.  Jordan found recruitment of teachers and even students difficult, as its reputation of intolerance for freedom of speech had spread across the country..  For the next few years, Stanford limped along with temporary instructors.  The 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which leveled many of the newly-built Stanford buildings, were another blow. Nonetheless, Jordan set about rebuilding the university - and the economics department. In 1906-07, Jordan finally secured the appointment of two permanent professors, both of them future stars - Allyn Young and, at Young's recommendation, Thorstein Veblen (who had just lost his job at Chicago) - overcoming their skepticism and reservations with guarantees. But things did not go well - Young felt overworked and underpaid, while Veblen's private affairs (and his notorious distaste for teaching) proved problematic.  Veblen was forced to resign in 1909, and Allyn Young departed in 1911 (for Washington University in St. Louis), soon followed by assistants Harry Millis (moved on to Chicago in 1912) and Ira Cross (who moved to Berkeley in 1914).  Alvin Johnson, who had been appointed to replace Young in 1911, stayed for only a year before moving on.  Jordan resigned as president in 1913, having failed to build an economics department as he had hoped from the start.   The reconstruction of the Stanford economics program had to wait for the interwar years, under the triumvirate of Bernard F. Haley, Edward S. Shaw and Moses Abramovitz.  Hotelling joined in 1924, but left by 1931.  Tarshis joined 1943, Kenneth J. Arrow in 1949, Hollis Chenery in 1952 (until 1961),  Hendrik Houthakker joined in 1954, Hirofumi Uzawa in 1956 (until 1964), Herbert Scarf in 1956 (until 1963).  Inter-disciplinary mathematicians Patrick Suppes and Samuel Karlin also contributed to the attraction of Stanford.  (Arrow, Karlin, Scarf, had been together at Rand before).  Arrow et al. presided over a famous mathematical economics seminar at Stanford from the late 1950s, ancestral to the current SITE.  Alain Enthoven (another ex-Randian, who had worked with Shaw and Gurley) joined in 1973. The Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) traces its roots to 1925, when a group of businessmen, led by form Sanford graduate Herbert Hoover, proposed setting up a school on the west coast..

Virginia," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the University of Virginia, William & Mary or George Mason] The US state of Virginia boasts several universities which have had a distinct role in the development of American economics.  The oldest college in Virginia (and second oldest in the United States) was the College of William & Mary, founded in 1693, in what was to become the colonial capital of Williamsburg.  The University of Virginia was chartered in 1819, and opened in 1825 in Charlottesville.  The University of Virginia established a northern campus at Fairfax in 1957, that evolved into the separate George Mason University in 1972. Virginia is the oldest English colony in north America (est. 1606), and home of its earliest governing institution (the House of Burgesses, est. 1619). As a result, Virginia elites liked to conceive of themselves as the enlightened vanguard of the fledgling United States in the 18th Century.   Virginia was the homeland of several founding fathers and early presidents of the United States - notably George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe. Unlike commercial and manufacturing rivals of Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania,  Virginia's wealth was primarily agricultural, much of it resting on large slave plantations.  As such, in the late 18th and early 19th Century, the Virginia elites embraced a different economic vision of the future of the United States, envisioning a primarily agricultural country, and articulated Enlightenment liberal ideals of limited small government, laissez faire and free trade.  The Virginia vision contrasted sharply with the more mercantilist, activist and protectionist ideas (the ""American system"") frequently found among leaders in Northern states.      gave the Virginia elite the self-conception as the vanguard of the Enlightenment in the fledgling United States in the 18th Century. Virginia was the homeland of several founding fathers and early presidents of the United States - notably George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe. Unlike commercial and manufacturing rivals of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, Virginia's wealth was primarily agricultural, much of it resting on large slave plantations. As such, Virginia elites articulated a different vision of the future of the United States, resting on agriculture and free trade, echoed in the South, rather than the Mercantilist and Protectionist instincts of the North.     Thomas Jefferson perhaps personifies the Virginia outlook - attracted to the land-oriented doctrines of the Physiocrats, and following up on the doctrines of the ideologues of Destutt de Tracy,  Say and the French liberal school.  Already in the 1770s Jefferson was educated at the College of William & Mary.  But he graduated well before James Madison (future Bishop of Virginia and a cousin of the namesake politician) took up the presidency of William & Mary in 1777.  As was to become customary in many American colleges, from 1784, the college president took on the responsibility of delivering a ""moral philosophy"" course to students in their final year.  In the standard curriculum of the time (modeled on Oxbridge), the first few years were almost solidly focused on ancient classics, some mathematics, and dabs of theology.  The final ""moral philosophy"" course was designed to top off the education of gentlemen-students, to inculcate the future civic leaders of the state with a general outlook on man and society.  The moral philosophy course was usually rather wide-ranging, covering ethics, law and politics.  Bishop Madison's course assigned readings from recent Enlightenment writers, such as Montesquieu, Rousseau, William Paley, Dugald Stewart, and others.   The difference in Bishop Madison's course is that, sometime in the the late 1790s, he began including ""political economy"" as part of it, assigning Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations as the textbook.  Bishop Madison's moral philosophy course at William & Mary is consequently the first instance we know of economics being taught at an American college.  Bishop Madison died rather suddenly in 1812  .After a two-year stint under John Bracken, the presidency of William & Mary was taken up by the physician John Augustine Smith in 1814,  Smith's course on moral philosophy retained the economic sections introduced by Madison..  J.A. Smith notably published his Syllabus in 1817, what ostensibly can be characterized as the first American college economics textbook. It was around this time that Jefferson was advancing his plans for a new state University of Virginia.  Already in 1779, while governor of Virginia, Jefferson had outlined plans to overhaul the system of education in Virginia, into a comprehensive public system, to be topped by a state university.  Jefferson had originally envisaged assigning William & Mary to that top role.  But W&M was a Episcopalian college, and so the plan was opposed by Presbyterians and Baptists in the Virginia assembly, who did not like the exclusion of Presbyterian colleges like Augusta College (f.1749, future Washington & Lee) and Hampden-Sydney College (f.1776) from the proposed system.  Jefferson's bill was not passed, and he gradually came around to the idea that a new non-sectarian college would have to be created from scratch. His spell as a diplomat in Europe during the 1780s brought Jefferson into contact with European Enlightenment thinkers, who had their own grand ideas about educational reform.  Over the next few years, Jefferson consulted repeatedly with several educational reformers, notably Joseph Priestley.  The Physicorat Dupont de Nemours wrote an outline of an education plan for Jefferson in 1800.  Jefferson came around to firmly embrace the idea of a secular college, with a curriculum centered around modern subjects. Jefferson set his educational plans aside during his presidency (1801-09) - although the foundation of West Point academy in New York, designed in imitation of the French engineering schools was foretaste of what was to come. After his retirement, Jefferson picked up the idea again. In 1810, he persuaded the Virginia assembly to establish a ""Literary Fund"", to funnel Virginia state money for education, the first step towards his grand plan for a state-funded universal education system.  In 1814, while residing in Monticello, Jefferson joined a neighborhood committee planning to establish a modest local academy to serve Albermarle County.  Jefferson quickly persuaded the Albermarle academy board to aggrandize its ambitions and erect a college of higher education to serve all of central Virginia.  In February 1816, the Virginia assembly chartered ""Central College"".  Jefferson launched a public subscription campaign, and raised enough private donations to begin construction of Central College in Charlottesville by October 1817, and make its first hire - Thomas Cooper.  But Jefferson's ambitions were grander.  In February 1818, the Virginia assembly finally capitulated to Jefferson's intense lobbying.  It declined Jefferson's plan for a system of universal public education for primary and secondary schools, but agreed to assign $15,000 from its Literary Fund to help fund a non-sectarian statewide university.  Governor James Preston appointed the ""Rockfish Gap Commission"" (chaired by Jefferson) to determine its location, structure and curriculum. After a year's discussion, the Rockfish Gap Commission recommendations were adopted by the Virginia assembly, and the ""University of Virginia"" was chartered on January 25, 1819.  It would take over Central College, then still under construction, in Charlottesville (Albermarle County).  But it would take several more years before it was finally ready.  Jefferson's ambitious architectural designs escalated costs rapidly - the state of Virginia would end up having to fork over some $250,000 by 1827, well more than the $15k originally envisaged.  The Board of Visitors finalized the curriculum in 1824 on a more modest scale, and the University of Virginia finally opened for classes in 1825. Jefferson had planned to have political economy on the UVA curriculum from the outset.  Indeed, as far back as 1814, Jefferson had tried to lure the great French economist Jean-Baptiste Say to move to Virginia, to teach economics.  Jefferson had also arranged for the translation and publication of  Destutt de Tracy's Treatise in 1817, hoping it would be adopted as the textbook at Virginia (indeed, Jefferson had pressed J.A. Smith to adopt Tracy's book at William & Mary, but Smith found it inadequate and dismissed it in a footnote in the 1817 Syllabus).  In 1819, Rockfish Gap Commission had recommended the establishment of ten professorship, including a separate professor of ""Government and Political Economy"".    Jefferson had originally wanted Thomas Cooper (his 1817 hire) to teach it, but opposition to Cooper's heterodox religious opinions had provoked opposition in the Virginia assembly and threatened to sink the plan.  To alleviate Jefferson from embarrassment, Cooper agreed to resign and decamped to South Carolina in 1820.  Nonetheless, the plan would not come to pass.   In 1824, citing financial difficulties, the University of Virginia's Board decided to appoint only eight professors - ancient languages, modern languages, mathematics, natural philosophy, natural history, anatomy, moral philosophy and law.   Political economy was to be subsumed under law.  But there was some delay hiring a professor of law, and as a result,  the professor of moral philosophy, George Tucker, appointed in 1825, began to teach political economy at University of Virginia in 1826.  When the law professor, John Tayloe Lomax, was finally hired later that same year, he was happy to leave economics in the hands of Tucker. In 1826, the year Jefferson died and the same year Tucker began teaching economics at UVA,  the College of William & Mary hired its own new professor, Thomas R. Dew, to take over the moral philosophy and economics courses from J.A. Smith, who had recently resigned the presidency of W&M. For the next twenty years, Virginia elites were delivered a steady diet of economics from either Thomas R. Dew at W & M or George Tucker at UVA.  Both Dew and Tucker were of the apologist school, defending laissez faire and free trade, widely embraced in the South, against the protectionist American System being pushed in the North.

Wisconsin," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the University of Wisconsin or any other organization. See the official University of Wisconsin website] The University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin, was founded in 1848 by the government of the state of Wisconsin, only a couple of months after Wisconsin was admitted as a state in the union.  Plans for a public university had been launched by the territorial government a decade earlier, in 1838. Provision for the establishment of a state university in the capital had been set out in a clause of the Wisconsin state constitution, and the act formally establishing the University of Wisconsin in Madison was signed by the state governor on July 26, 1848.  University of Missouri president John H. Lathrop was appointed the first chancellor of the University of Wisconsin in 1849.  Unlike the Ivy League universities of the east coast, the ""Wisconsin experiment"" was to provide a publicly-funded higher education to the ordinary citizens of the state.  As such, from the outset, ""public service"" was written into the very foundations of the university.  However, having little guidance on what this meant, Wisconsin immediately embraced the Anglo-Saxon ""finishing school"" model of the private universities: a ""classical"" curriculum (Latin, Greek, rhetoric, mathematics, etc.), heavy emphasis on moral development and a dab of economics only in the final year.   Soon enough, the Wisconsin State Legislature, which believed that the university had failed its ""public service"" promise, began campaigning against it. Annoyed at the pressure, Lathrop resigned in 1859, and was briefly replaced by Connecticut educator Henry Barnard.  Long-time mathematics professor John W. Sterling took up the presidency in 1861.   The Civil War of the 1860s thinned the classes and the unpopular university was on the verge of closure.  So, to justify its existence, the university finally got around to fulfilling its public service role.  Its first step was to create a teacher's college (and enrolling legions of women).  In 1863, Sterling made Wisconsin co-educational, opening admission of women to the main college (""Normal School"").  But after the war, his successor in 1867, Paul Chadbourne, decided to split it into male and female colleges (the battle for coeducation would be taken up by Chadbourne's successor John Twombly in 1870).. In 1866, availing itself of the land-grant funds from the Morrill Act of 1862, the university set up a College of Agriculture.  A Department of Engineering and School of Law followed soon after.  Much of the traditionally-minded older faculty disapproved of these practical changes, but the State authorities were beginning to see promise and in 1872 voted for annual subsidy to support the university.  In 1874, John Bascom became the president of the university and the final-year lectures on economics fell upon him.  Bascom had previously (when at Williams College) been very much of the American ""apologist"" school and had written a textbook in this tone.  However, he had grown more favorable to progressive causes, like the prohibition of alcohol and women's suffrage, and consequently began advocating a role for an interventionist state in society.   Bascom's lectures to Wisconsin seniors were full-blown articulations of Christian Socialist doctrine.  Bascom inspired the generation of undergraduates who would later lead the Wisconsin Progressivist movement.   However, at the time, Bascom's crusades fell foul of the more practically-minded political appointees of the Board of Regents and so he was pressured out of office in 1887.   Bascom's replacement in 1887, geologist Thomas C. Chamberlin, had different ideas.  For him, public service was not ""moral enlightenment"" but rather providing a modern and practical education to the common citizenry.  It was Chamberlin who initiated ""extension lectures"" on practical subjects to Wisconsinites in all walks of life and encouraged cooperation between the schools of agriculture and engineering and local farmers, craftsmen and manufacturers.   Chamberlin was also an avid promoter of serious graduate research on the ""German"" model.   Chamberlin instituted graduate fellowships and earned degrees.  Wisconsin granted its first Ph.D in 1892.  The creation of the well-funded University of Chicago in 1892 seemed to threaten Chamberlin's vision of making Wisconsin the premiere university of the American Midwest.  Frederick Jackson Turner, a history professor and recently-returned graduate from Johns Hopkins, suggested that Chamberlin may be able to lure the prominent Richard T. Ely, then unhappy with his situation at Hopkins.  Chamberlin quickly convinced Wisconsin's Board of Regents to loosen the funds to found a School of Economics, Political Science and History (along the ""French model"" of a civil service training school).  Ely was then offered the directorship of the School.  He arrived in 1892, bringing with him a coterie of Hopkins graduate students.  These included the newly-minted Ph.D. William A. Scott, who was immediately appointed assistant professor at Wisconsin.  David Kinley and Charles J. Bullock came as students and took on teaching responsibilities.  But Chamberlin himself would not stay on - lured by Chicago, Chamblerin decamped that same year to lead its geology department.  Wisconsin poached Charles Kendall Adams from Cornell to succeed Chamberlin as the new president of Wisconsin. Although Ely was happy as the autonomous and undisputed master of the social sciences at Wisconsin, he was quick to get into trouble.  He gave many ""public extension"" lectures on a variety of topics (including ""On Socialism""), which raised the eyebrows of some of the more conservative elders of the state.  The violent Pullman Strike of 1894, which paralyzed railway networks in the Midwest, had brought the labor question back up.  The left-leaning Ely was quickly denounced for his ""pernicious doctrines"" undermining the notion of public property and was accused of being an ""anarchist"".  Some politicians and state officials demanded his dismissal, but the new Wisconsin president, Charles Kendall Adams, decided to stand behind Ely.  After public hearings by the state's Board of Regents in 1895, Ely was exonerated and the Board put forth an eloquent statement in  defense of the principle of academic freedom (its final phrase ""Whatever may be the limitations which trammel inquiry elsewhere, we believe that the great State University of Wisconsin should ever encourage that continual and fearless sifting and winnowing by which alone the truth can be found."" - was later engraved on a plaque and placed at the entrance of the main university building at Wisconsin)      In the 1890s, while Wisconsin economics was taught by Ely, Scott, Kinley and Bullock, the program expanded greatly.  In 1893, Kinley moved on to the University of Illinois and, In 1895, Bullock moved on to Cornell.  Two Wisconsin Ph.D.s, Edward D. Jones and Helen Page Bates, were appointed to the faculty to replace them.   A new Hopkins Ph.D., Thomas S. Adams, was appointed in 1901 to teach public finance.  Henry C. Taylor, a Wisconsin Ph.D., initiated a program in agricultural economics in 1902.    However, Ely's power over the social sciences was being simultaneously diminished.  In 1900, in an effort to hold onto Turner, the Wisconsin administration created a separate ""School of History"", reducing Ely's realm to a mere School of Economics and Political Science. That same year, a separate College of Commerce was created with Walter Scott as its head.  Although it had the professional objective of training businessmen, it siphoned off the enrollments in Ely's School.  In 1903, a College of Letters and Sciences was created and Ely's School was folded into it as one of its constituent departments, thereby undermining his autonomy. Struck by ill-heatlh, C.K. Adams had left as president in 1901, and after a period under the interim Edward A. Birge, the progressive Charles Van Hise became president of the University of Wisconsin in 1903. A close ally of Wisconsin governor La Robert Follette, it was Van Hise who articulated the ""Wisconsin Idea"" most clearly, setting out the public mission of the university during the Progressive Era. In an effort to raise his profile, Ely founded the American Bureau of Industrial Research in 1904 with the financial assistance of Yale's Henry W. Farnam.  The intention was to create a history of American labor.  Ely used the funds to bring in John R. Commons, his old student from Hopkins days, as professor of political economy at Wisconsin in 1904.   Another old Ely student, Edward A. Ross, was given an appointment at the department of sociology in 1906. With these appointments, Wisconsin quickly surged ahead of the academic pack, leapfrogging over Hopkins, Harvard, Yale and other aspiring schools.  Only Columbia could ostensibly be considered above it in the production of new economics Ph.Ds. For much of its history, the University of Wisconsin had only one campus (Madison), but a variety of ""university centers"" (outgrowths of the extension movement).  In the post-war period, the Wisconsin state legislature elevated a number of state teacher's colleges into fully-fledged ""Wisconsin State Colleges"", outside of the UW system.  In 1955, the University of Wisconsin created its second campus at Milwaukee, by merging the UW extension center in Milwaukee with the local Wisconsin State College. In 1964, UW was reorganized, with one central administration (UW) and three constituent units: UW-Madison, UW-Milwaukee and ""UW-University Centers"" (covering nine centers at the time). In 1969, the UW centers at Green Bay and Parkside were raised to separate UW colleges. Finally, in 1971, the Wisconsin State legislature established the ""University of Wisconsin System"", merging the UW units (Madison, Milwaukee, Green Bay, Parkside, and remaining Centers) with the nine Wisconsin State Colleges into a single overarching system.

Yale ," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by Yale University or any other organization. See the official Yale University website] Yale University, in New Haven, Connecticut, is one of the √©lite ""Ivy League"" colleges of the United States.  It was set up in 1701 as a Congregationalist college and named in 1718 after Elihu Yale, an East India Company officer who had donated his substantial fortune to the fledgling college.  Like its ancient rival, Harvard, Yale followed the ""Anglo-Saxon"" model.  For much of its early history, it was little more than a finishing school for the upper crust of American society.  Students at Yale College were given little room for specialization - everyone having to go through the same curriculum, with an option of only two electives in the entire four years.  Young faculty, no more than students, were given few options - Yale College hiring only tutors for Greek, Latin and Mathematics. In the mid-19th Century, Yale was placed under external pressure to ""modernize"" its curriculum and introduce a modicum of specialization and graduate studies. Theodore Dwight Woolsey, a disciple of Lieber, rose to become Yale president in 1846.  After stiff resistance, the Yale powers compromised by creating, in 1847, the Department of Philosophy and the Arts to provide graduate instruction in traditional subjects (Latin, Greek, etc.) plus some modern ones (chemistry, metallurgy, agricultural science, engineering, philology).   From 1860, the Department was authorized to grant the first Ph.D.s in the United States.  The scientist J. Willard Gibbs was among the first to receive one. However, pressure remained to expose undergraduates to modern subjects.  Again, Yale compromised in 1854 by creating a distinct undergraduate ""scientific school"" covering the experimental sciences, English literature, history, philosophy and modern languages.  It was re-baptized in 1861 as the Sheffield Scientific School.  From the outset, the Scientific School was kept distinct from Yale College and different undergraduate degrees were awarded (B.Phil. vs. B.A.).   Unlike Yale College, the Scientific School was starved of financial resources and depended heavily on its own student fees and donations from well-wishers in the American scientific community.  Paid lectures given to the wider public brought in some much-needed funds. Courses in economics was introduced into the ""Select Course"" of the Sheffield Scientific School in the 1860s by Daniel Coit Gilman, a Yale graduate recently returned from a tour of Germany.  During his stay, Gilman had sowed the seeds of a movement to reform Yale College itself.  Gilman was very much a proponent of the ""German model"" of education (which he would later set up at Johns Hopkins) and the younger faculty of Yale College were thrilled by the innovations introduced at Harvard around this time.  However, the powers-that-be at Yale College, under president Noah Porter since 1871, would have none of it.  Frustrated, Gilman departed for Berkeley in 1872. He was replaced by Francis Amasa Walker, the first to hold the title of Professor of Political Economy at Sheffield Scientific School. However, Gilman left enough of a momentum to convince Yale College to hire its own rival economist that very same year, William Graham Sumner. The simultaneous appointment of Francis A. Walker and William Graham Sumner in 1872 was intended to maintain the separation between Sheffield Scientific School and Yale College.  As Professor of Greek and Ancient History, Sumner was expected to teach the classical Yale curriculum, adding only a dab of social science at the very end to satisfy the restless Yale students.  ""Real"" social science was still confined to Walker's ghetto at the Sheffield Scientific School.  But Sumner was no pushover nor did he have any intention of fulfilling President Porter's bidding.  Instead, he took the leadership of the movement to modernize the Yale College curriculum. Sumner loosened the ""classical"" requirements and introduced modern social science at Yale College.  Much to the horror of the clerical administration at Yale, Sumner did not balk from having his students read ""enlightened heretics"" like John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer,   Although Walker and Sumner seemed to have the same objective of furthering social science at Yale, the personal antagonism  between the two men ensured that they would never cooperate on anything.  This rivalry was enhanced by their opposite stances on the hot political topics of the day.  Sumner was an unabashed and strident apologist; Walker had a soft spot for some of the progressive causes, such as bimetallism.  Furthermore, Sumner (being a Yale B.A. and ""religiously correct"") had the ear of the Yale establishment, while Walker, very much the outsider, remained confined to the lonely and silent fringes of the community.  The rise of Johns Hopkins in the 1870s had deprived the Sheffield School of its most promising graduate students. Feeling he was wasting his time at Yale, Walker was tempted to join Hopkins on a permanent basis (he served as a visiting professor there).  In 1881, Walker had enough and decamped to take up the presidency of M.I.T.    However, the arrival of German-trained ""new generation"" of American economists in the 1870s had already begun to tilt the balance.  Henry W. Farnam and Arthur T. Hadley (both Yale B.A.s with German graduate training) were appointed to Yale College in 1878 and 1879 -- albeit as tutors in Latin and Greek, respectively.   In 1880, Farnam was suddenly elevated to ""Professor of Political Economy"" and, in 1881, replaced Walker at Sheffield.  Magnanimously, Farnam used his independent wealth to have the long-suffering Hadley appointed as ""Professor of Political Science"" in 1886.  Hadley's appointment basically closed to door on Thorstein Veblen aspirations.  Veblen had obtained his Ph.D. in philosophy at Yale in 1884 under Sumner and President Porter and had since been angling for a position there.  Soon after the departure of President Porter, the new Yale president, Timothy Dwight, decided to strengthen graduate studies.  In 1887 Yale College was officially renamed Yale University. In 1890, a new department was created, the ""School of Political Economy"".  Placed under William Graham  Sumner's direction, it was supposed to rival Columbia's own successful School of Political Science.   A third German-trained economist, John C. Schwab, joined the faculty directly as ""lecturer in political economy"" that same year.   In 1891, the ailing Sumner departed for a two-year absence to recover his health.  The department was left in the hands of Arthur T. Hadley, who was swiftly appointed as Professor of Political Economy.  That same year, he appointed the newly-minted Yale Ph.D. and mathematics tutor, Irving Fisher, to teach a course on the ""Mathematical Theory of Prices"".   In 1892, the Department of Philosophy and Arts was formally renamed the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and given a distinctly self-governing status (and for the first time, women graduate students were welcomed).  Arthur T. Hadley was appointed as its first dean.  That same year, Sumner returned, but decided to confine himself to sociology and anthropology.  Farnam used his substantial financial resources to buy the declining New Englander and Yale Review (founded 1843) and re-launched it in 1892 under a new name, The Yale Review.  It was intended to become the house journal of Yale social scientists and was only discontinued after the establishment of the AER.  Schwab and Fisher were both appointed professors of political economy in 1898 and took over the bulk of the teaching (under Hadley's direction).   In 1899, Hadley became the President of Yale University while Fisher took a three-year leave of absence for medical reasons.  Some of the load was taken up by John Bates Clark (on loan from Columbia).  In 1900, Henry C. Emery, a Columbia, Ph.D. (and the first non-Yale B.A.) was appointed to teach international trade.

German Universities," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the German government or any German educational institution ] The first German universities were erected in the 14th C.  Prague (1348), Vienna (1365) and Heidelberg (1386) were established by princes, while Cologne (1388), Erfurt (1392), Rostock (1419) and Greifswald (1456) were established by city authorities.  Leipzig (1409) was created by students exiled from Prague during the Hussite troubles.  In the 15th Century, Freiburg (1457), Basel (1460) and Trier (1472) were established at the instigation of the Pope and Church authorities. Traditionally, the establishment of a university (Studium generale) required a papal or imperial bull.  But in 1495, Emperor Maximilian passed decree allowing German electors to set up universities themselves.  By the turn of the century, the major landed princes sponsored the formation of universities for students from their duchies: Ingolstadt (Bavaria),  T√ºbingen (W√ºrttemberg), Frankfurt-am-Oder (Brandenburg) and Wittenberg (Saxony).  During the Middle Ages, German schools were relative backwaters of Medieval Scholasticism.  Although Cologne managed to acquire some early repute, many remained poor cousins to the great Scholastic centers of Paris, Bologna and Oxford, or even the next tier schools of Italy and France. German scholars were accustomed to go abroad to to study and teach, and they continued to do so in great numbers. German student ""nations"" abounded in the formation of the Medieval universities in Italy and France.  It is consequently unsurprising that there were no universities in Germany in the first couple of centuries of the Scholastic era, and that the first German universities had to be erected by the vanity of princes, with a student catchment drawn mainly from the east.  Things only really began to change during the ""Great Schism"" between Rome and Avignon in the late 14th Century. Holy Roman Emperors, popes and bishops tried to dissuade German students from going abroad to the Avignon-backing Kingdom of France, finally allowing universities in Germany to gain some traction. The Protestant Reformation in the 16th Century rocked the German universities. The spearhead of the reformation was the University of Wittenberg, which counted the pioneering Protestant theologians Martin Luther, Andreas Boderstein ""Carlstadt"", and Philip Melancthon among its faculty.  The universities of Erfurt and Ingolstadt,  home base of Johannes Eck, led the Catholic counter-reformation.  As the existing faculties in traditional universities purged Protestant sympathizers from their ranks and students, there was the need for the creation of new universities to collect them.  So Protestant princes set about doing so - Protestant universities were established at Marburg (1527), K√∂ningsberg (1544), and Jena (1558), while the Nuremberg city authorities established one at Altdorf (1578).  Entering the fray was the Reformed (Calvinist) wave emanating from Switzerland, and for a time, the Calvinists had quite some success establishing themselves in existing universities - famously taking Heidelberg, Frankfurt-am-Oder and newly-created Marburg (which forced the creation of Giessen for exiled Lutheran students).  The counter-reformers were not far behind.  The Jesuits led the way in the late 16th C., and took control of old Catholic schools such as Vienna, Cologne, Mainz, Trier, Ingolstadt, Freiburg and (temporarily) Heidelberg and Prague.  They also assisted German Catholic bishops in in setting up new Catholic universities at Dillingen (1554), W√ºrzburg (1582), Graz (1585), Paderborn (1615), Osnabr√ºck (1630), Bamberg (1648), Innsbruck (1669), Breslau (1702), Fulda (1734)  (however, many of these were little more than glorified Jesuit gymnasiums).  The Jesuit hold on the Catholic German universities was broken in 1773, when the Jesuits were expelled from the Holy Roman Empire by order of Emperor Joseph II. The religious struggles inside the universities were gradually settled.  Matriculation was opened up and non-sectarian, and religious affiliations gradually lost significance.  Except for the theology faculties, which (with a few exceptions) remained exclusively dedicated to one denomination.  The sectarian competition in the 16th Century  had led to the creation of many new universities, and the pace of creation did not abate in the 17th Century.  German princes were lured to establish their own universities, partly as prestige projects for their principalities, leading to an oversupply of universities, to the point where many had insufficient students to maintain them.  On the eve of 1789, there were over forty German universities.  The reorganization of German principalities and states during the Napoleonic era was accompanied by the closure and merger of many old universities, so that by the 1820s, only about half remained.  Storied old universities like Cologne, Erfurt, Trier, Mainz, Dillingen and Altdorf were shut down and disappeared forever.  Frankfurt-am-Oder was absorbed by Breslau (1811), Wittenberg was merged with Halle (1817),  Ingolstadt moved to Munich (1826) and M√ºnster to Bonn  (1818).  The University of Berlin (f.1809) was the only new university founded from scratch since the mid-18th C. Around the time of German unification in 1871, just as the German Historical School was beginning to spread its wings,  there were fifteen full universities in Germany.  Nine of these were in Prussia - six in old Prussia (Berlin, Bonn, Breslau, Greifswald, Halle and K√∂ningsberg) plus three annexed into Prussia by the wars of 1864-66 (G√∂ttingen,  Kiel, Marburg), three were in Bavaria (Erlangen, Munich, W√ºrzburg), two in Baden (Freiburg, Heidelberg) and one each in Saxony (Leipzig), W√ºrttemberg (T√ºbingen), Hessen (Giessen), Mecklenberg (Rostock), Saxe-Weimar (Jena) and (after 1871) Alsace-Lorraine (Strasbourg).  To these fifteen should be added the five German-language universities in Austria-Hungary (Czernowitz, Graz, Innsbruck, Prague, Vienna), the three in Switzerland (Bern, Basel, Zurich) and one in Russia (Dorpat). [Map of Germany] Of the fifteen universities of the 1871 German Empire, only three (Munich, W√ºrzburg, Freiburg) were Catholic, most of the rest were Protestant.  The exceptions were Bonn, Breslau and T√ºbingen, which were ecumenical (had both Catholic and Protestant theological faculties).  Structure As a rule, complete German universities were organized into four separate faculties: a  theological faculty, a juridical faculty, a medical faculty and a philosophical faculty.  The ""philosophical faculty"" (the German equivalent of ""Arts & Sciences"") encompassed everything not captured by the other three, so it included philosophy, mathematics, philology, history and cameralistics.  The exceptions to the ""four faculty rule"" were:
- Bonn, Breslau and T√ºbingen which, as noted, had two theological faculties (one Catholic, another Protestant)
- Munich, W√ºrzburg and T√ºbingen had a separate ""political economy"" faculty.
- T√ºbingen had a separate ""natural science"" faculty. Each faculty had its dean and operated near-independently.  The university as a whole was overseen by a Senate, presided by a Rector, the ultimate arbiter of the university's fate.  The Senate usually consisted of the current Rector, the previous Rector, the four faculty deans and five faculty members.  The deans, senate and rector were elected yearly by the entire body of professors ordinary. Lectures were given by professors ordinary, extraordinary and private (privat-docent), all of whom had to have a higher doctoral degree (habilitation).   Matriculation was open to any native who presented a graduation diploma from a gymnasium, and to any foreigner with a certificate of good moral character. A normal course ran three years (four for medicine).  There were other schools of higher learning in Germany, which did not count as universities.  Among these were the ten ""polytechnic high schools"", of which there were two in Berlin, the others in Hanover, Aachen, Munich, Dresden, Stuttgart, Karlsruhe and Darmstadt.  There were also the military academies, among which we can count two academies for the general staff army (Berlin and Munich), a naval academy (Kiel), two artillery/engineering academies (Berlin and Munich) and five ""war schools"" (Potsdam, Erfurt, Neisse, Engers, Cassel). German-model university In their early history, most German universities followed conventional Medieval models, with a lower Faculty of Arts (called ""Faculty of Philosophy"" in Germany) and three higher faculties (Theology, Medicine, Law).  Each faculty constituted a guild of teachers, and to acquire membership in a faculty, a candidate must submit himself to an examination, usually a Latin disputation, by existing masters in order to obtain his membership certificate (""degree"").  Following the Italian tradition, German faculties used the term ""doctor"" rather than ""master"" (common in France and England).  Thus the Anglo-French ""Master of Arts"" translated equivalently to ""Doctor of Philosophy"" in Germany (Dr. phil, from whence Ph.D.)   Masters of the other faculties were called doctors of theology (Dr. theol.), medicine (Dr. med, or M.D.) and law (Dr. juris, or J.D.).  Lower degrees, like licentiates (baccalaureus), were not granted by the faculties, but rather by the university as a qualified certificate to teach (with limitations). Starting already in the 1700s, and accelerating in the 1800s, the Prussian university authorities began substituting the disputation and examination of doctoral candidates, which had become nearly an empty routine ritual, with the defense of a written thesis demonstrating original research.  Successful defense of the dissertation before the faculty was required to receive doctorate degree.  The practice was soon adopted throughout German universities.  As such, German universities were the first to impose earned degrees from research.  The Faculty of Philosophy, by this time, had already moved beyond the traditional ""seven liberal arts"" to include a wide range of humanities, sciences and social sciences. At the same time, the requirements for a Ph.D. were deemed insufficient to lecture and supervise doctoral students at the university level, and the Habilitation was introduced, that is, a second dissertation, showing a higher and more advanced degree of research. While the doctoral degree was obtained usually at the end of a course of study at a university, the habilitation could take many additional years to write. Usually, the candidate merely registered his intention to submit a Habilitation at a particular university, and then went off to write it, while simultaneously making a living at other jobs, frequently residing in a completely different city.  Only when the Habilitation was completed and accepted, could the candidate apply for academic positions at a university. The Habilitation was required to enter the rungs of German academic hierarchy, which were determined at three levels.  The highest was the ""Professor ordinary/ordinarius"" (ordentlicher Professor),  that is, a professor who held the chair representing the field at a faculty.  Below him were one or several ""Professor extraordiny/extraordinarius"" (au√üerordentlicher Professor), a professor without a chair, roughly equivalent to an associate professor.  They could not be promoted to ordinary unless the chair was vacant, as a result many extraordinary professors at a university would not rise in-house, but wait until a chair at some other university opened up, and then move there..  Finally, there was the Privat-dozent, roughly equivalent to an assistant professor, who lectured and supervised students on a temporary basis.  However, only the ordinary and extraordinary professors were salaried by the university.  Privatdozents were unpaid, and made their (modest) living off student fees, while waiting for a call to a formal faculty position.  The Habilitation was required for all three ranks, and all three ranks gave lectures. Attendance at lectures was supposedly mandatory for students, although there were usually no obligatory in-class examinations or written assignments to accompany them.  The entire verification of a student's academic achievement rested on the final degree examinations (written and/or oral) at the end.   As a result, it was not unusual for German students to skip lectures entirely, study whatever they liked, and rely on private tutors to prepare for the degree examinations.  The importance of academic degree examinations diminished in the 18th Century with the introduction of separate state examinations (conducted by state officials rather than the universities) for entrance into the professions and official positions.  But for those intent on an academic career as a teacher, the doctoral dissertation was vital and really made the successful student distinct.  The significance of the doctorate varied by faculty, e.g. in the medical faculty, the doctorate was relatively insignificant and the entire weight was placed on the rigid state examinations, while in the theological faculty, doctorates were relatively rare, most coming away with licentiates, and doctorates reserved for highly accomplished scholars. The German model university contrasted sharply with the English (and American) universities, which were still tied to classical curricula and where degrees remained largely unearned. Obtaining a Bachelor of Arts at an Anglo-American university was frequently a matter of showing up to a final examination, which was largely ceremonial.  Ritual questions were asked by friendly masters, merely to fulfill the statutes, and failure impossible (unless one showed up drunk and assaulted the examiners).  The Master of Arts degree did not even have the pretence of an examination. A graduate obtained an M.A. upon request, after a couple of years, provided they had stayed out of jail and their name had not shown up in scandal sheets. As these unearned degrees did not demonstrate any intellectual or academic ability, many foreign students flocked to German universities, to earn doctorates that distinguished them from the pack.  Americans in particular were drawn to graduate studies in Germany in the late 19th Century, and returned back the United States, eager to adopt the German research university model (see ""New Generation""). Economics in Germany Although rudimentary economics - under the Aristotlean rubric of ""practical philosophy"" - had been on the philosophy curriculum of Medieval universities, it was largely ignored by the Scholastics as a poor source for the exercise of their intellectual acrobatics. Nonetheless, it was revived during the Reformation at Protestant universities (esp. by Philip Melanchthon at Wittenberg) since it coincided with Lutheran paternalistic views of the family and State.  In the 17th Century, the Thirty Years War, and its aftermath, led to a desperate need to re-organize princely finances, and German princes looked to the universities for assistance. Public officials were mostly drawn from the law faculties of German universities, and the pressure was soon on to develop explicit courses dedicated to ""cameralistics"" (proto-economics) in German universities.  ""Cameralism"" was essentially the theory and practice of public administration, public finance and economic policy.  Although its economic precepts have much in common with Mercantilism, Cameralism was not articulated by merchants in pamphlets, but rather by public officials in handbooks for administration. Cameralistic handbooks would later be adapted as textbooks in German universities. The first two chairs in cameralistics/economics were established in the same year, 1727, by the Prussian king Frederick William I - a chair in ""Oeconomie, Policey und Cammersachen"" at the law faculty of the University of Halle for Simon Peter Gasser, and a chair in  ""Kameral-Okonomie und Polizeiwissenschaft"" at the University of Frankfurt-am-Oder (later Breslau) for Justus Christoph Dithmar.  The first economics chair (""polizei- und cameral wissenschaft"") at the University of Vienna was established in 1763 for Joseph von Sonnenfels. As cameralistic ideas were primarily contained in large handbooks rather than pamphlets, there remained a need for a smaller, quicker means of communication of ideas, and economics journals also began to be developed in Germany, also from the universities.  From Frankfurt-am-Oder, Dithmar launched what can be regarded as Europe's first economics journal, Die Oekonomische Fama, in 1729.   Georg Heinrich Zincke, a professor of cameralistics at Leipzig, published his own journal, the Leipziger Sammlung from 1744.  Physiocratic Johann August Schlettwein, the first economics professor at Giessen, established the Archiv f√ºr den Menschen und B√ºrger in allen Verh√§ltnissen in 1780. In the second half of the 18th Century, German intellectual life was energized by Enlightenment winds from France. The French Encyclop√©die inspired Johann Georg Kr√ºnitz to launch his monumental Oeconomische Encyclop√§die in 1773, which would eventually run through some 242 volumes (to 1838).   The French Physiocrats had a significant influence on German economics, counting the German prince Charles Frederick Margrave of Baden, Johann von Schlettwein and Isaak Iselin as early enthusiasts.  Iselin established the Ephemeriden der Menschheit in Basel  in 1776, while Schlettwein, the first economics professor at Giessen, established the Archiv f√ºr den Menschen und B√ºrger in allen Verh√§ltnissen in 1780.. Jakob Mauvillon's popular summary of Physiocratic doctrine in 1776 led to a vigorous debate in Germany.  J. v. Sonnenfels, C.W. Dohm (1778) and J.F. Pfeiffer (1780) defended the Cameralistic doctrines against the new Physiocratic liberalism promoted by J. Mauvillon (1776, 1880), K.G. F√ºrstenau (1778) and Johann Springer (1780), with Georg Andreas Will taking an intermediary position. The Napoleonic wars, and particularly the traumatic defeats of Austria at Austerlitz in 1805 and Prussia at Jena in 1807, changed things yet again.  They provided the immediate impulse for comprehensive institutional reforms in German states. As usual, this was driven primarily by state officials. The old Cameralistic handbooks were dusted off and updated . The universities were overhauled, and many struggling schools were shut down or merged.   State bureaucracies were modernized, and the role of government was re-thought.  Political and economic models for the new German states were drawn primarily from France - albeit they came in sometimes contradictory packages of Napoleonic statism and French liberalism.  In the southern German states - like Baden, W√ºrttemberg and Bavaria - there were deep changes to political systems, carving a greater role for constitutions and representative bodies, but their economies remained set on largely cameralistic lines.  By contrast, in Prussia, the political system was only minimally changed, but the economy was loosened up with a dose of laissez faire.  Prussian liberals, like Carl Christian Kraus in K√∂ningsberg, brought Adam Smith into the curriculum, and had significant success in breeding a new species of reforming Prussian bureaucrats, notably Karl August von Hardenberg and, later on, Rudolph von Delbr√ºck.  Their Southern counterparts, such as like F.B.W. von Hermann in Munich, faced a more uphill battle, particularly after Friedrich List gave southern protectionism a new modern theoretical basis. In German universities, economics was taught partly in the juridical faculty and partly in the philosophical faculty (with the exception of the three universities which had a separate dedicated political economy faculty).  The first separate economics faculty was the ""Public Economics Faculty"" (Staatswirtschafliche F√§kultat) at University of T√ºbingen, established by Friedrich List  in 1817.  The other two were Munich and W√ºrzburg. Heidelberg professor Karl Heinrich Rau's three-volume classical economics textbook (Lehrbuch der Politischen √ñkonomie, 1826), was extraordinarily successful and adopted in many German universities in the 19th Century.  Rau's curriculum partitioned economic studies into economic theory (Volkswirtschaftslehre or, simply, National√∂konomie), economic policy (Volkswirtschaftspolitik) and public finance (Finanzwissenschaft).  Rau's tripartite division of economics would prevail in teaching in German universities until the late 20th Century. German societies and journals K.H. Rau also established arguably the first proper academic economics journal, the Archiv der Politischen Oekonomie und Polizeiwissenschaft in 1835.  The T√ºbingen economics faculty, led by Robert von Mohl, launched their own more general journal (which covered economics, political science, public law, etc.), the Zeitschrift f√ºr die gesammte Staatswissenschaft (ZGS), in 1844.  The two journals would merge in 1853 under the ZGS name, and be sometimes colloquially referred to as the ""T√ºbinger Zeitschrift"". Economic societies were also formed in Germany.  The rise of the free trade movement in Germany had led to the formation of the Deutscher Freihandelsverein (German Free Trade Association), in 1846 by the English-born laissez faire activist John Prince-Smith (its formal name was actually the ""Wissenschaftlicher Verein f√ºr Handel und Gewerbe"" - ""Scientific Union for Trade and Industry"").   Provoked by the introduction of protectionist tariffs on pig-iron the Zollverein in 1844, Prince-Smith's Freihandelsverein was modeled and energized by the success of Anti-Corn Law League in Britain.  The Freihandelsverein drew its principal support from  the northern port cities of Hamburg and Bremen and northern agriculturalists (southern industrialists and liberals, following List, tended to be protectionist on foreign trade).  The Freinandelsverein's propaganda campaigns and influence nonetheless increased.  The variety of free trade activists and clubs throughout German states came together to form the Kongre√ü deutscher Volkswirte (Congress of German Economists), which was launched in Gotha in September 1858.  The Kongre√ü subsequently held yearly congresses in Frankfurt, 1859, Cologne 1860, Stuttgart, 1861 and Weimar, 1862.  The Kongre√ü served as the umbrella to a series of regional economic societies formed at this time.  The Freinhandelsverein morphed into the Volkswirtschaftliche Gessellschaft zu Berlin (Economic Society of Berlin) in 1858, drawing primarily from liberal circles in the environs of Berlin.  Other regional Volkswirtschaftliche Gessellschaft emerged in other German territories, including the VG for the Northwest (Feb 1859), East & West Prussia (Aug 1860), Saxon Lands (Oct 1860), Middle Germany (Thuringia) (1861), Southwest (1861) and Rhineland-Westphalia (1862).    In 1863, the Berlin VG society launched its own journal of political economy, the Vierteljahrschrift f√ºr Volkswirthschaft und Culturgeschichte, albeit most of its pieces were policy advocacy rather than  economic science properly speaking.  The liberals reached their apex with the Franco-Prussian trade treaty of August 1862, bringing Prussia and the German Zollverein into the Anglo-French free trade network, and continued to exert influence through the 1860s.. However, their influence changed remarkably after the unification of the German Reich in 1871 and Bismarck's break with the liberal parties. Economists of German Historical School inclination seceded from the free-trader Kongre√ü in 1872, during the ""Social Question"" ('soziale Frage') debate, and went on to form their own society, the Verein fur Socialpolitik, in 1873. The Historicist Bruno Hildebrand launched the Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr National√∂konomie und Statistik (JNS) in 1863, which had an overtly academic orientation.  It would become a major outlet for the German Historical School.  It was carried on by his son-in-law, Johannes Conrad, after 1878.  A second historicist journal was launched in 1877 by Lujo Brentano, with the long mouthful of a name Jahrbuch f√ºr Gesetzgebung, Verwaltung und Volkswirtschaft im Deutschen Reich (JfGVV).  After the editorship passed to Gustav von Schmoller in 1881, it was commonly referred to simply as ""Schmollers Jahrbuch"" - in contrast with the older JNS, which now became known as ""Conrads Jahrbuch"". The Austrian School launched its own separate journal in 1892, the Zeitschrift f√ºr Volkswirtschaft, Sozialpolitik und Verwaltung (ZfVSV), edited by Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk and others.  Soon after, in 1893 another group of historically-minded Austrian economists, led by Stephan Bauer founded what would become the Vierteljahrschrift f√ºr Social- und Wirthschaftsgeschichte (VSWG). 18th C. German journals 19th C. German journals Zeitschrift f√ºr Social- und Wirthschaftsgeschichte (ZSWG) (f. 1893, Vienna) and edited by Austrian economic historians Stephan Bauer, Carl  Gr√ºnberg and L.M.

Swedish Universities," Economics was a relative latecomer to Sweden.  The first chairs in economics were established around the turn of the century in the faculties of law of Swedish universities - notably  David Davidson at Upsala (1899),  Knut Wicksell at Lund (1901),  Gustav Steffen at Gothenburg (1903) and Gustav Cassel at the newly-founded University of Stockholm (1904).  In 1909, the Swedish business community founded a separate 'commercial high school' (:""Handelsh√∂gskolan"") in Stockholm, essentially a self-contained business school or ""school of economics"". Eli Heckscher held the economics chair at the Stockholm SE from the outset (1909). The ""Stockholm School"" proper can be defined as the group of Swedish economists, working in the decade between roughly 1925 and 1940, trying to extend Wicksell's brand of Neoclassical theory from the static to the dynamic, e.g. incorporating anticipatory expectations (Myrdal), intertemporal equilibrium (Lindahl) or disequilibrium sequence economies (Lundberg).  Stockholm school member Ohlin famously challenged Keynes's claim to primacy in macroeconomics in the late 1930s.

The Emigr√©s," The rise of Fascist and Nazi governments in Central Europe during the 1920s and 1930s was usually accompanied by the purges of universities, and the dismissal of faculty, researchers and students.  The reasons for dismissal varied - some, notably in Nazi Germany, were removed on racial grounds (e.g. of Jewish extraction), many others for their political leanings (Socialists, Liberals), others for refusing to swear personal oaths of allegiance to the new regime and its self-styled leader, and some for simply not being enthusiastic and supportive enough of fascist doctrines and policies.  Many did not wait for dismissal, but left their positions voluntarily - out of fear, or out of disgust, or because they found the new atmosphere hostile and uncongenial or simply felt that their academic freedom was severely compromised.  Regardless of the reasons, the 1930s saw the wholesale implosion of the university systems of Germany, Austria, Italy and elsewhere.  The expansion of Nazi power during the war expanded the purges to occupied Belgium, France, etc. The legions of unemployed academics looked abroad to find new positions - in Britain, the United States, Turkey, whomever would take them.  This was not easy. Although other nations were politically more democratic, this was the height of racist and xenophobic times across the board, and tight immigration restrictions had been set up since the 1920s.  This prevented the emigr√© scholars from simply taking a boat, but had to secure positions first, which meant finding a sympathetic sponsor abroad. Given the general paucity of available academic positions, combined with the fact that many universities informally maintained quotas to limit the number of Jews and foreigners on campus, this was not easy.  And even if they got a position, they had to get their immigrant visas approved by suspicious and often uncooperative government authorities.  Given the severe limits imposed by immigration laws and the immense wave of refugees, available quotas were quickly filled during this time, and they frequently had to plead their individual case for exception, which made it doubly harder.  The herculean task of assisting the emigr√© scholars find their way abroad was undertaken by many sung and unsung heroes.  From prominent university leaders, like Alvin S. Johnson,  who tirelessly worked to overcome internal prejudices to bring the emigr√© scholars over, to major institutions, like the Rockefeller foundation, who helped fund them, to small local volunteer groups, like the British ""Blue Knights"", who helped with the more mundane matters like housing, paperwork, etc., upon their arrival.  Every emigr√© scholar has a story of an angel, or group of angels, who made their escape possible.  Not all succeeded - some, in despair, turned to suicide for escape, others perished in concentration camps. Central Europe has never quite recovered from the wholesale destruction of its universities during the fascist-nazi era - or rather, have never quite recovered the prominent perch from which they fell.  Before this period, German universities had enjoyed a reputation as the foremost  research universities in the world, the leading centers of scientific research and scholarship, attracting foreign students and scholars, and jealously modeled by others.  By contrast, American and British universities, hitherto relative backwaters, seemingly more interested in the education of gentlemen than research, were transformed, as the emigr√© scholars supplied its faculties with a vital injection of seriousness and research-orientation. The major immediate beneficiaries - at least initially - of the emigr√© scholars were not the old, prejudiced universities, but new institutions which had been recently (or purposefully) created .   Alvin S. Johnson, president of the New School for Social Research, took a lead role in finding places for European social scientists in American universities, when these ran out, he decided to set up an entire university division - the ""University in Exile"" - to host them.  Similarly, the Oxford Institute of Statistics and the Cowles Commission raked the wave of European emigr√©s, and cemented their ascent.  Without the emigr√©s, it is doubtful whether they would have existed, or achieved what they did. While less existentially vital to old, well-established universities, some - notably Cambridge, Harvard, Princeton and (to some extent) Chicago - reaped an enormous gain from the scholars and enjoyed a golden age because of them. It is worth noting that some emigr√©s arrived in their foreign homes before the Fascists or Nazis took power - the vital dates of 1933 for Germany, 1938 for Austria or 1940 for France, are not necessary hard dates across the board.  Some had gone abroad already, often on Rockefeller fellowships and the like, some with premonitions from the political violence, others quite innocently, and simply decided not to return.

Royal Economic Society (RES)"," The Political Economy Club was founded in London in April, 1821.  The leading spirit behind its formation was Thomas Tooke, who hoped to rally support of prominent London figures behind the principle of free trade and to coordinate their influence in parliament to support the 1820 London Merchants Petition. From the outset, the Political Economy Club was a closed club, and did not seek to reach out to the general public (save for parliamentary circles).  It was originally limited to 30 members (increased to 35 in 1847) .  Founding members of the club included politicians, civil servants, journalists and the leaders of the Classical School - James Mill,  David Ricardo, Robert Malthus,  Robert Torrens and Thomas Tooke.  Later members included notables such as Nassau W. Senior, J.R. McCulloch and J.S. Mill and W.T. Thornton.  The Political Economy Club did not have a permanent location.  It met originally at Freemason's Tavern on 61-65 Great Queen Street (now the ""New Connaught Rooms""), near Covent Garden (w).  In 1850-61, they met at Thatched House Tavern on St. James's Street in Westminster.  They continued moving around, e.g. from 1861  meetings were held at St. James's Hall (w),  then from 1867 at Willis's Rooms (w), then in 1877 at Pall Mall restaurant (w), after 1880 at the Inns of Courts Hotel (near Lincoln's Inn w).  It now meets at the Royal Automobile Club on Pall Mall (w). The Political Economy Club met every month on the first Thursday (changed to Friday c.1880), from February to July, plus December.  The proceedings of the club involved members submitting a question for discussion (usually revealed a fortnight or so in advance), related to a particular economic policy, or the progress of economic theory, which was to be discussed in an evening banquet dinner (starting at 7:30 or so).  Proceedings were tightly regulated.  There was no lecturing, the chairman introduced the question, and the fist discussant had a 25-minute limit, and subsequent discussants, upon demanding the word, could not exceed fifteen minutes.  The whole meeting usually lasted a little over an hour.  The minutes of the discussions were recorded, but not published. The PE Club had no active publication outlet - it sponsored the reprinting of old scarce tracts in political economy, but that was about it. The Political Economy Club would later include, as honorary ex officio members, the sitting chairs of political economy at the major English universities - which in the 19th Century meant Oxford, Cambridge, University College London, King's College, London and Owens College, Manchester.  The invitation was extended to the economics chairs of the Irish and the Scottish universities.  Some prominent British politicians (usually Whigs/Liberals) were also made honorary members by virtue of their ministerial office, e.g. William Gladstone, Hugh Childers, Viscount Goschen, George Shaw-Lefevre, Arthur Balfour, etc. Despite its closed nature, the Political Economy Club was a domineering influence in 19th C. economics.  But its exclusivity prevented it from becoming a wider association for economists.

British Association (BAAS)," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the British Association or any other organization. See the official BAAS. website] The British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) was the brainchild of the Edinburgh scientist David Brewster and the clergyman Vernon Harcourt, with the backing of William Whewell, Charles Babbage, John Hershel and others.  Disappointed by what they perceived to be the narrow elitism of the Royal Society and the general decline of science in the British Isles,  Brewster & co. looked around for a solution to promote science not only among professionals, but also among amateur enthusiasts and the general public.  They were inspired in particular by the continental associations, notably the Association of Physicians and Naturalists set up in Munich in 1822 and the German Congress of Scientists which had met in Hamburg in 1830. The BAAS was founded with a threefold aim: first, to promote and fund scientific research efforts; secondly, to engender communication between scientists throughout Britain and disseminate information of scientific results; thirdly, to publicize and promote the cause of science among the general public.  The first meeting was held at York in September 27, 1831 and its first president was Charles William Wentworth, Lord Fitzwilliam. In 1832, William Whewell invited Adolphe Quetelet to speak at the Cambridge conference of the BAAS.  Quetelet's presentation on statistics and social science and electrified the audience. In the aftermath, Whewell, Babbage, Richard Jones and Robert Malthus, the dean of English economics, persuaded the BAAS president Adam Sedgwick to found ""Section F"", focused on statistics, which would include political economy.  Arguably, Section F of the BAAS has been regarded as the first professional association of economists. The founding group of Whewell, Jones, Babbage, Malthus & co. had originally envisaged Section F to serve as an empiricist counterweight to the influence of the theoretical Ricardians and their Political Economy Club.   Section F was labeled only  ""Statistics"" in 1835, and only changed to ""Economic Science and Statistics"" in 1856, with the ""economic science"" as a catch-all term to capture the empirical and policy-oriented papers on public administration (sanitation, strikes, etc.) that were usually presented at its meetings, rather than economic theory proper (which were rarer).  The status of Section F reached a nadir in 1877, when it was formally proposed by, among others, Francis Galton, that economics be dropped from Section F of the BAAS on account of its methods being too ""unscientific"".  Or, as Lord Bramwell would summarize the alarming controversy a decade later, its opponents suggested ""not that political economy was dead, but that it had never lived - that there never was such a science."" (1888: p. 704).  The reliance of economists on Section F of the BAAS as their only professional organization was diminished with the foundation of the British Economic Association (since renamed the Royal Economic Society) in 1890.

Royal Statistical Society (RSS)," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the Royal Statistical Society or any other organization. See the official RSS. website] The Statistical Society of London was founded in 1834, right on the heels of the foundation of Section F (""Statistics"") of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1833.  The SSL was formed ""in pursuance of a recommendation"" in March, 1834 by the BAAS ""for the purpose of collecting, arranging and publishing facts calculated to illustrate the position and prospects of Society, and especially facts which can be stated numerically and arranged in table....and the condensation, arrangement and publication of those already existing"" (""Objects of the Statistical Society"", 1876, p.3).   The motto of the SSL -  aliis exterendum (""for others to thresh out"") - indicated that the society was concerned with facts  and only facts, interpretation and opinion was to be left to others. At its founding, the SSL was housed on St. Martin's Lane, in  facilities rented from the Royal Society of Literature. In 1844, the SSL moved briefly to new rented facilities on Regent Street, and then, from 1846, for a considerably longer period of its history, it was at the London Library on St. James Square. (The Institute of Actuaries was a sub-tenant). In 1874,the SSL moved once again, this time to facilities in King's College London, a not-surprising choice given the long association of the society with the college (through Tooke, Newmarch, Thorold-Rogers, Leone Levi, William A. Guy and others (source)). The Statistical Society of London was incorporated by royal charter in 1887 and was renamed the Royal Statistical Society.

Cobden Club," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the Cobden Club or any other organization] The Cobden Club was founded in 1866 in London, as a society to spread the free trade doctrines of the Manchester School.  It was named after Richard Cobden, who had died the previous year.  In a sense, it was the successor of the Anti-Corn Law League of Manchester.  It was a completely different creature from the Political Economy Club of London, which was an exclusive dinner discussion club.  The Cobden Club was not even a ""club"" in a proper sense - it had no facilities or regular meetings, save for a annual dinner, but more akin to a society.   Membership was open to the public (it counted among some 750 members, domestic and foreign by the end of the 19th C).  Its large annual dinner meeting consisted of lectures and free-wheeling discussion. The principal object of the Cobden Club was to influence general public opinion, and from the outset had a publishing arm.  Membership fees were charged and subscriptions raised to fund numerous publications and pamphlets for widespread distribution.

Fabian Society," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the Fabian Society, the Labour Party or any other organization. See the official Fabian Society website] The British counterpart of the German Marxian revisionists and heavily influenced by the English Historical school, the upper-middle-class intellectual group - the ""Fabian Society"" - emerged in 1884 as a strand of latter-day utopian socialism. They became known to the public firstly through Sidney Webb's Facts for Socialists (1884) and then through the famous Fabian Essays in Socialism (1889) written by the Fabian ""inner circle"". The ""Fabians"" were named after Fabius, the famous Roman general which opposed Hannibal as they were ""biding their time"" until they would ""strike hard"".  Exactly when this strike would occur was a perennial question.   Eschewing the revolutionary tactics of more orthodox Marxians, the middle-class Fabians were more directly involved with politics and practical gains - through contacts not only in the ""International Labor Party"", trade unions and cooperative movements but also throughout the entire British political apparatus (Liberals and Tories included). At the core of the Fabian Society were the Webbs - Sidney J. Webb and his wife, Beatrice Potter Webb (married 1892). Together, they wrote numerous studies of industrial Britain, alternative economic arrangements (esp. cooperatives) and pamphlets for political reform. At the core of their system was the Ricardian theory of rent which they applied to capital as well as land (and labor as well - their opposition to high labor incomes was also an issue). Their conclusion was that it was the state's responsibility to acquire this rent (a position strikingly familiar to Henry George.  Their later admiration of Soviet Russia stemmed partly from Stalin's ""efficiency"" at acquiring this rent.  The playwright George Bernard Shaw and the political scientist Graham Wallas were the other members of the early Fabian ""inner circle"". As one contemporary noted, the Fabians ""combined an ounce of theory with a ton of practice"". The practice, for the Fabians, was to influence public opinion in the direction of socialism. This was to be accomplished, they argued, not through mass organization but rather by the selective education of the powerful ""few"" who would lead the reforms in government (hopefully themselves), thus they only belatedly extended their appeal beyond the narrow intelligentsia class from which they arose. It was the Webbs who founded the London School of Economics (L.S.E.) in 1895. Through the relentless outpouring of Fabian Essays and the charismatic appeal of the Webbs - coupled with the prowess of literary figures such as George Bernard Shaw and H.G. Wells - ensured that they would be indeed influential among British intellectuals and government officials. Alfred Marshall, for one, readily admitted his sympathies for the Fabian cause (although he abhorred their anti-theoretical stance). Philip Wicksteed - who tangled with Shaw over the labor theory of value and marginal utility theory - was considerably more critical. It was this narrowness of appeal that led some Fabians, such as G.D.H. Cole and novelist H.G. Wells to break with the Fabians. Cole went on to establish the ""Guild Socialists"" who relied more on state-chartered but nonetheless self-governing producer organizations of workers - ""guilds"" - than on the intellectual-government machine the Fabians preferred. In this sense, the ""Guild Socialists"" were closer to the French syndicalism of Sorel - albeit a bit more muted. Further splits in the Fabian camp emerged when the Webbs and Shaw decided to throw their weight behind the British Imperial enterprise - supporting the Boer War and other colonial misadventures - as they felt their reforms (when they came about) would thus have a wider application. An overarching British Empire, they believed, would be a more efficient conductor of reform than a multitude of smaller countries. The Webb's support of monopolies was also well-known -- particularly, in their famous 1897 claim that ""higgling in the market"" (i.e. competition) was inimical because competitive prices always bore down on the workers. Thus, monopolies are more desirable as they would have more room to treat their workers better. The Fabians finally disintegrated in the 1930s for a variety of reasons. Firstly, the Webbs' unqualified admiration of Soviet Russia seemed distasteful to too many in their group. Secondly, the ascendancy of the British Labour Party on the back of trade union activism had rendered the Fabians superfluous. This body of working class activists did not trust the paternalistic and nationalistic Fabians (esp. after the Education Act of 1902, essayed by Sidney Webb and against which almost all of the Labour Party was mobilized).  However, Arthur Henderson, Labour Party leader from 1914 to 1922 was himself a Fabian and it was Sidney Webb who authored the famous Clause Four of the Labour Party charter committing it to a Socialist basis. Thirdly, they lost control of the L.S.E. when Cannan and then, more vigorously, Robbins turned it on a decidedly Jevonian track.  Fourthly, their intellectual influence during the 1930s was overshadowed by that of Keynes.   Finally,  many of the reforms they had advocated had actually been undertaken during and after the Great Depression, thus rendering their work, in a sense, ""complete"". Of particular importance was the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state in Britain in the 1940s following the famous 1942 ""Beveridge Report"".

Royal Economic Society (RES)," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the Royal Economic Society or any other organization. See the official RES. website] The Royal Economic Society was founded as the British Economic Association in November 1890, as a venue for professional economists in the United Kingdom. Prior to its creation, British economists had been gathered at four other venues, but each of them had their limitations.  The oldest, the Political Economy Club in London, founded back in 1821, was an exclusive dinner discussion club, confined to 35 members, and did not put out publications.  The Cobden Club, founded in 1866, had open membership and a vigorous publication arm, but it was more geared towards disseminating Manchester School propaganda among the general public, not the interchange of ideas and research among economists.  Since 1832, professional economists had been gathered under Section F (""Economics and Statistics"") of the  British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS), but it was a large association diluted by other sciences.  They put out general reports of the proceedings, but economics papers were often buried in the shuffle.  Section F presentations at its annual meetings were also not strictly economics - discussions ranged widely, and often covered minutiae of wider public policy issues, such as sanitation and strikes.  Moreover, the rest of the scientists viewed the economists with the suspicion - indeed, in 1877, they proposed the BAAS should drop Section F altogether.  Finally, there was the  Statistical Society of London (SSL), founded in 1834, also inhabited by economists, which indeed had a dedicated journal. However, the SSL was fundamentally empirically-oriented, and refused to expand its scope to cover more theoretical or policy articles. Outside of Britain, professional economics associations had emerged, much to the envy of some British economists. The German Verein f√ºr Socialpolitik (f.1873) had led the way, and was the model followed by the American Economic Association (f.1885).  Britain also had no dedicated economics journal, equivalent to the French Journal des √©conomistes or the American Quarterly Journal of Economics, or the multiplicity of German academic Zeitschrifts and Jahrbuchs.   Through the 19th C., British economists were still forced to published primarily in general literary reviews or magazines.  This was not an inevitable British quirk - British philosophers and historians had already abandoned the reviews, and set up regular specialist journals like Mind (f. 1876) and the English Historical Review (f.1886). It was with these lessons in mind that the idea for a British society of economists, with a specialist journal, began to form.  It emerged initially from discussions around 1883 between journalist R.H. Inglis Palgrave (then president of Section F) and Herbert S. Foxwell (then economics professor at  UCL).  Palgrave had initially hoped for a society to raise subscriptions to reprint economics classics, but Foxwell persuaded Palgrave it ought to put out a specialist journal instead.  The initiative gathered traction when taken in hand by banker-turned-politician George J. Goschen and Cambridge moral sciences professor Henry Sidgwick.  Goschen had initially wanted a Verein-like association, at the intersection of academia and public policy, but Sidgwick nudged it in the more purely academic direction.  Goschen gradually brought in other political figures, like Leonard H. Courtney, Arthur Balfour, John Morley and the Duke of Argyll, as sponsors, while Sidgwick and Foxwell set about recruiting the academics.  For several years, the project remained on the burner as many academics showed little interest - nobody really wanted to take on the task of editing the projected journal.  But the idea accelerated quickly when the Christian Social Union of Oxford launched its journal, the Economic Review.  Not willing to be left behind, the Cambridge economics professor Alfred Marshall (then also president of Section F for that year) quickly climbed aboard, and sent out circular letters canvassing economist members of other societies (BAAS, SSL, etc.) for the form of organization. Foxwell had originally envisaged a closed society (to keep the quacks out), but Marshall preferred an open one.  After some debate, an open society formula was agreed upon. The first meeting of the British Economic Association was held on November 20, 1890, at University College in London, with some 200 people in attendance (partial list).  Viscount Goschen (then chancellor of the Exchequer) chaired the meeting, and Alfred Marshall (as president of Section F) was the first to address it and lay out the case for the formation of the Association and a journal.  Resolutions were gradually passed.  The open formula was agreed upon for membership. Edgeworth spoke up to insist also on the openness in the journal to all schools of thought (""no test of orthodoxy"") and all methodologies.(p.10).  Sidgwick piped in to remind that its goal was solely scientific and did not have in mind the advancement of any policy or political stance.  This became a wrinkle later on in the meeting, when George Bernard Shaw protested that, if so, then a government official such as Goschen should not be chairing the meeting nor be elected president of the BEA (Goschen was quick to pass the word to Marshall, before sheepishly agreeing with Shaw) (p.13) Despite misgivings, Viscount Goschen was elected the first president of the BEA while Francis Ysidro Edgeworth (then at KCL) was elected as the first secretary of the BEA, and first editor of the Economic Journal.  L.L. Price, H.S. Foxwell and T.H. Elliot were to be the correspondence secretaries  (p.12)..  Notables on the first council included Charles Bastable (Whately chair at Trinity College Dublin),  James Bonar (civil servant), William Cunningham (Cambridge), H.S. Foxwell (UCL, RES secretary), Sir Robert Giffen (government statistician), John K. Ingram (Dublin),  John Neville Keynes (Cambridge), Alfred Marshall (Cambridge), J.E.C. Munro, John Shield Nicholson (Edinburgh), R.H. Inglis Palgrave (journalist), L.R. Phelps (Oxford's CSU), L.L. Price (Oxford), Henry Sidgwick (Cambridge), Llewellyn Smith (Oxford Extension) and Philip Wicksteed (London Extension).  (The Drummond professor at Oxford, J.E. Thorold Rogers had only recently died, otherwise he would have probably also been included.) As the Economic Journal announced in its inaugural issue, ""journal should represent all shades of economic opinion an be the organ not of one school of economists, but all schools."" (1891: p.2).  This seems only partly evident. The initial council of the BEA was a relatively eclectic bunch including old Classical economists like Bastable, Nicholson, Price and Sidgwick, moderate Neoclassicals like Marshall, Neville Keynes and Foxwell, radical Jevonians like Edgeworth and Wicksteed , Historicists such as Cunningham and Ingram, and Christian economists like Phelps.  But the absence of confirmed socialists was conspicuous (Shaw would later go on to mumble that the BEA was not nearly as open as Wicksteed's old ""Hempstead Circle"" had been). The first issue of the Economic Journal came out in March 1891, and would remain a quarterly.  A subscription price of 1 guinea (=21 shillings) was decided upon (10 guineas for a lifetime subscription).  Edgeworth would remain at the editorship helm for many years (although editing duties were shared by younger assistants like Henry Higgs and, later on, John Maynard Keynes).  Membership climbed quickly in its early years, reaching 750 by 1894, but it dropped off soon after. A decade later, King Edward VII granted a charter (dated December 2, 1902) sponsoring the British Economic Association, and as a result it was subsequently renamed the ""Royal Economic Society"" (EJ, March, 1903, p.1)      Presidents of the BEA/RES Resources on the  Royal Economic Society   All rights reserved, Gon√ßalo L.

"American Societies
American Social Science Association (ASSA)
American Economic Association (AEA)
American Academy of Political and Social Science (AAPSS)"," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the American Economic Association or any other organization.] The American Social Science Association (ASSA) was an association of American social reformers and researchers that existed between 1865 and 1909.  The ""Mother of Associations"", the ASSA spawned numerous reform societies on charities, prisons, education, etc., as well as professional associations of historians (AHA), economists (AEA), social scientists (AAPSS), sociologists (ASA), and political scientists (APSA). Up until the 1870s, economics, and the social sciences in general, had been largely the province of amateur researchers and social reform activists. The earliest American association in the social sciences (generally speaking) was the American Statistical Association (founded 1839). The ASA had been modeled after the Statistical Society of London, where researchers and activists could present and share empirical data on social phenomena they were investigating, advise each other on methods and lobby governments to undertake more systematic collection of data. Mass immigration, industrialization and rapid urbanization in the 1850s brought up a series of social problems in many northeastern US cities  - poverty, disease, crime, etc.    Municipal governments, gripped by battles for patronage between gangs of politicians, were largely inattentive. As an industrial laboring class and indigent underclass grew,  cities went practically ungoverned. A number of voluntary private charities had emerged in response to the rising urban problems, but found themselves overwhelmed. The disparate collection of philanthropic charities, uncoordinated and unsystematic, had only a partial or superficial understanding of the dimensions, causes and remedies of the social problems they were trying to address.  Despite the presence of elite names in philanthropic ranks, they had little ability to influence unresponsive local governments and legislatures, which continued to be primarily guided by vested interests.  This began to change with the end of the Civil War.  Many activists who had been previously involved with the abolitionist movement, such as Franklin B. Sanborn, Samuel G. Howe, Wendell Phillips and William Lloyd Garrison, re-directed their energies and organizing skills to the urban charity movement.   The ASSA was originally founded in Boston in 1865 by a group of Massachusetts charities, under the title ""American Association for the Promotion of Social Science"" (soon renamed ""Social Science Association"").  It was modeled on an equivalent British society, the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science (NAPSS) founded by Henry Brougham in 1857.  Neither the NAPSS in Britain nor the ASSA in the US were academic-oriented institutions.  Rather, they were designed as networks of social reformers, usually educated upper and middle classes, of various backgrounds (teachers, charity workers, ministers, lawyers, doctors, journalists, businessmen, government officials, etc.).  The associations put them in touch with each other in order to communicate research in social problems, and into contact with politicians to coordinate a variety of social reforms and bring them into legislation, e.g. on public health, sanitation, education, prisons, etc.   The idea for the ASSA was launched by the Board of State Charities of Massachusetts (est. 1862, by Sanborn, Howe and others), which issued a circular letter on August 2, 1865 calling for the establishment of an organization: ""object shall be the discussion of those questions relating to the the sanitary condition of the people, the relief, employment and education of the poor, the prevention of crime, the amelioration of criminal law, the discipline of prisons, the remedial treatment of the insane and those numerous matters of statistical and philanthropic interest which are included under the general head of 'social science'"" (Massachusetts Board circular, 1865, Documents, p.10) The ASSA was formally founded at a conference on October 4, 1865 at the Boston State House presided over by Massachusetts governor John A. Andrew, and attended by several hundred figures which read like a ""who's who"" of the activist and academic elite from the Boston area (minutes) A constitution was adopted and MIT founder William B. Rogers was elected the first president of the ASSA, and Samuel Eliot and Franklin Sanborn as secretaries.  Journalist Henry Villard was appointed permanent secretary in 1868.. The idea of ""social science"" at this time was still inchoate.  Previous work on economics and social theory in the 1830s and 1840s tended to be sweeping and abstract rather than particular and concrete.  They contemplated man and society in some ideal philosophical sense, or on an vast historical-civilizational scope, rather than upon current observation of what was actually there.  Driven by hypothetical models rather than detailed data, contemporary economics had few specific applications. As a result, what passed for economic policy primarily addressed grand themes such as the trade, currency, population,  etc., mostly from a general perspective.  Moreover, much of conventional economic theory had been constructed in the early 19th Century, before the industrial revolution had really taken wing, and as a result economic models did not handle mass industrialization and the rise of the industrial working classes very well. Unlike the socialists, the social reformers in the ASSA were not opposed to the new industrial capitalist order, nor did they seek to change it in any fundamental way, but merely to introduce humanitarian ""cures"" to some of its social side-effects.  A good part of this mission was focused on education - not only educating the poor to improve their habits and integrate them in mainstream American society, but also educating those who minister to the poor, and educating legislators.. Behind this effort was the implicit notion that there was such a thing as a ""science of society"" that could be discovered, taught and applied to current social problems.  The social reformers of the ASSA had their critics, not only on the socialist left (who saw them nearly as apologists for the system), but also on the right - notably the social darwinist followers of Herbert Spencer - who mocked their ""social science"" and decried their meddling  (cf. PSM, 1874. p.367).   The ASSA defined ""social science"" as the science of  ""man as a social being"", to be conducted by ""collecting facts, applying principles and reaching the general laws which govern the social relations"".    Its initial scope covered education, health, poverty and crime, the main focus of the urban charities. (1869 note).  Accordingly, in 1865 the ASSA initially established four ""departments""  (it originally planned six, but reduced them to four under the short labels of ""Education"", ""Health"", Finance"" and ""Jurisprudence""; see coverage in 1865 declaration, p.15; ""Finance"" was shorthand for ""Economy, Trade and Finance"").  It was envisioned that the chairmanship of each departments would to be headed by a professional practitioner - a college professor in Education, a physician in Health, a judge or lawyer in Jurisprudence, but Finance was a little trickier, as economists were not quite professionalized yet.  The initial 1865 configuration of departments was ""Education"" (under Harvard president Thomas Hill), ""Health"" (under abolitionist S.G. Howe), ""Finance"" (under Yale president Theodore Dwight Woolsey) and ""Jurisprudence"" (under jurist and ex-Columbia economist Francis Lieber).  ASSA members were expected to enroll in one of the four (later five) departments.  All members annually elected the General Committee, which in turn appointed the Department Committees.. The ""Executive Committee"" consisted of the general officers plus the department chairs, which met monthly in Boston. In its early years, ASSA membership fees were $5 and numbers fluctuated wildly.  The ASSA's objectives were ""first, to gather all the information within reach, both at home and abroad, with regard to social science, both at home and abroad, in all its branches; and second, to diffuse this information through and beyond our country"".  The means of dissemination was through conferences and (to a lesser extent) the sponsoring of public lectures and publications.  For the first fifteen years, the ASSA held two conferences per year - the small ""annual meeting"" (usually held in Boston in January, mostly for association business), and the ""general meeting"", a large conference held either in the Spring or Fall, in various US cities (from 1880, both the annual meeting and general conference were held together). Conference attendees came mostly from New England-New York area.  For a quarter of a century, between 1876 and 1899, the ASSA general conference was held almost invariably in Saratoga, a small resort town in upstate New York.  Papers, studies and proposals were usually presented at the general meeting, although occasional papers were presented in the Boston annual meeting and local chapter meetings (notably Philadelphia)  Proceedings of the ASSA meetings were originally published in the Journal of Social Science, launched in 1869.  The JSS was not quite a journal with outside submissions, but rather an annual volume that merely reprinted the conference papers. The ASSA had tremendous growing pains.  After an initial flurry of activity, interest began to fade and the association began to drift.  After the energetic Villard resigned as secretary in 1870, he was not replaced and membership and conference attendance dropped dramatically, to the point where no meetings were called in 1871 and 1872.  A Philadelphia social science association, founded in 1869 under William Strong,  remained active, held monthly meetings and soon outnumbered the national association in Boston.  The national ASSA was saved from dissolution in November 1872 by the efforts of Boston philanthropist James M. Barnard and Harvard academics Louis Agassiz and Benjamin Pierce.  The ASSA was reorganized and revitalized.  Civil service reformer George W. Curtis was made president, and former abolitionist Franklin Sanborn took over the reigns of permanent secretary. Membership began to increase again, and hovered around 300 thereafter.  The success of Philadelphia forced the ASSA to look beyond New England and take local branches more seriously.  Recognizing that social legislation in the United States tended to happen at the municipal and state level, rather than the federal, the ASSA set up a process for the easier formation of local branches after 1872. Branches were soon set up in Detroit, St. Louis, San Francisco, Galveston and elsewhere.  Directorships in the national ASSA were expanded to include more persons from the Midwest, West and South, and national conferences were even held in Detroit (1875) and Cincinnati (1878), before the Saratoga custom imposed itself. The most significant change post-1872 was the increasing interest by academics in the ASSA and its decided turn towards greater professionalism.  This was a novelty.   In 1870, social sciences were largely unknown and absent from American universities, which up until then was dominated by classical curriculums taught by clerical professors, with only a dab of economics in the final year ""moral philosophy"" lectures, usually delivered by the president.  But starting in the early 1870s, electives in the social sciences began being introduced in university curriculums and professorships in political economy started being established.   The spearhead of these changes were led by reformist university presidents, many of whom were active in the ASSA, especially after 1872.  This includes Daniel Coit Gilman (then at Berkeley, soon Johns Hopkins), Andrew Dickson White of Cornell, Charles W. Eliot of Harvard, Theodore Dwight Woolsey of Yale, Frederick Barnard of Columbia, James McCosh of Princeton, E. Benjamin Andrews of Brown, Martin B. Anderson of Rochester and, of course, William B. Rogers of MIT.  The transition in social science from amateurs to professionals is reflected inside the ASSA after 1872, when academics began to take charge of the departments - e.g. C.W. Eliot took over ""Education"", Emory Washburn over ""Jurisprudence"", etc. . The moribund ""Finance"" section was split into two departments in 1874 - ""Finance"" (under David A. Welles, then W.G. Sumner from 1875) and ""Social Economy"" (under W.B. Rogers), bringing the number of departments in the ASSA to five. Economists of the time (e.g. David A. Wells, Arthur L. Perry, Francis Lieber, Amasa Walker, Francis A. Walker, William Graham Sumner, Edward Atkinson) tended to concentrate in the ""Finance"" department, leaving ""Social Economy"" to the social activists. The ASSA spawned numerous social reform organizations, such as the National Prison Association (1870), the National Conference of Charities (1874) and the American Health Association (1874), which often met in parallel sessions at Saratoga or other venues. But by the late 1870s, as the academics took control, the papers presented at the main conference began becoming increasingly theoretical, dealing with general policy questions, like trade, currency and taxation, without attachment to any particular social reform cause.  By the early 1880s, the ""Finance"" section of the ASSA was essentially a scientific association of professional economists. The big thing of the ASSA was its annual national conference, where people from all over the country met. In the 1880s, as social scientists were finally setting themselves up in universities as professional academics, it quickly dawned that this was a unique opportunity for holding parallel conferences on more exclusively academic topics they were researching. The Johns Hopkins academics were the first to part ways and use the annual ASSA meeting to set up exclusive sessions for themselves, without the confusing hoi polloi of amateurs. The historians, under Herbert Baxter Adams, defected first, founding the American Historical Association (AHA) in 1884. This was followed up by the economists, under Richard T. Ely, who founded the American Economic Association (AEA) in 1886. These moves had encouraged by Hopkins president Gilman as a way to raise Hopkins's national profile. The Penn economists (James, Patten) actually protested the creation of the AEA. They disliked the professional character of the AEA and the segregation of economics from the other social sciences. They urged economists should stay under the ""Economics"" and ""Finance"" sections of the ASSA meetings as the best avenue to fulfill its social reform function. They saw the AHA & AEA defections as a Hopkins-engineered gambit to take over the profession. As the ASSA was impotent to prevent it, and hobbled as a result, the Penn economists struck out on their own and founded their own association, more in line with the original open ASSA spirit. The Philadelphia branch of the ASSA  was one of the more active branches anyway, so it was not too hard to elevate that branch into a new American Academy of Political and Social Science (AAPSS, f.1889). Further specialization in the late 1890s and early 1900s finally separated economics from sociology from political science, and professors in the latter wanted their own professional association.  The political scientists formed their own American Political Science Association (APSA) in 1903, and the sociologists formed the American Sociological Society (now ASA) in 1905.  With the academics all gone into their own associations, the ASSA was hallowed out, and basically wound up by 1909. The current mid-winter meetings of the AEA are held under an umbrella called ""Allied Social Science Association"" (ASSA).  This is unrelated to the original ASSA, but the choice of acronym, if not deliberate, is a fortuitous coincidence.  It is right and proper that the the current meetings still evoke the memory of the great Saratoga meetings of the American Social Science Association, the mother of them all.

ASSA members were expected to enroll in one of the four (later five) departments.  All members annually elected the General Committee, which in turn appointed the Department Committees.. The ""Executive Committee"" consisted of the general officers plus the department chairs, which met monthly in Boston. In its early years, ASSA membership fees were $5 and numbers fluctuated wildly.  The ASSA's objectives were ""first, to gather all the information within reach, both at home and abroad, with regard to social science, both at home and abroad, in all its branches; and second, to diffuse this information through and beyond our country"".  The means of dissemination was through conferences and (to a lesser extent) the sponsoring of public lectures and publications.  For the first fifteen years, the ASSA held two conferences per year - the small ""annual meeting"" (usually held in Boston in January, mostly for association business), and the ""general meeting"", a large conference held either in the Spring or Fall, in various US cities (from 1880, both the annual meeting and general conference were held together). Conference attendees came mostly from New England-New York area.  For a quarter of a century, between 1876 and 1899, the ASSA general conference was held almost invariably in Saratoga, a small resort town in upstate New York.  Papers, studies and proposals were usually presented at the general meeting, although occasional papers were presented in the Boston annual meeting and local chapter meetings (notably Philadelphia)  Proceedings of the ASSA meetings were originally published in the Journal of Social Science, launched in 1869.  The JSS was not quite a journal with outside submissions, but rather an annual volume that merely reprinted the conference papers. The ASSA had tremendous growing pains.  After an initial flurry of activity, interest began to fade and the association began to drift.  After the energetic Villard resigned as secretary in 1870, he was not replaced and membership and conference attendance dropped dramatically, to the point where no meetings were called in 1871 and 1872.  A Philadelphia social science association, founded in 1869 under William Strong,  remained active, held monthly meetings and soon outnumbered the national association in Boston.  The national ASSA was saved from dissolution in November 1872 by the efforts of Boston philanthropist James M. Barnard and Harvard academics Louis Agassiz and Benjamin Pierce.  The ASSA was reorganized and revitalized.  Civil service reformer George W. Curtis was made president, and former abolitionist Franklin Sanborn took over the reigns of permanent secretary. Membership began to increase again, and hovered around 300 thereafter.  The success of Philadelphia forced the ASSA to look beyond New England and take local branches more seriously.  Recognizing that social legislation in the United States tended to happen at the municipal and state level, rather than the federal, the ASSA set up a process for the easier formation of local branches after 1872. Branches were soon set up in Detroit, St. Louis, San Francisco, Galveston and elsewhere.  Directorships in the national ASSA were expanded to include more persons from the Midwest, West and South, and national conferences were even held in Detroit (1875) and Cincinnati (1878), before the Saratoga custom imposed itself. The most significant change post-1872 was the increasing interest by academics in the ASSA and its decided turn towards greater professionalism.  This was a novelty.   In 1870, social sciences were largely unknown and absent from American universities, which up until then was dominated by classical curriculums taught by clerical professors, with only a dab of economics in the final year ""moral philosophy"" lectures, usually delivered by the president.  But starting in the early 1870s, electives in the social sciences began being introduced in university curriculums and professorships in political economy started being established.   The spearhead of these changes were led by reformist university presidents, many of whom were active in the ASSA, especially after 1872.  This includes Daniel Coit Gilman (then at Berkeley, soon Johns Hopkins), Andrew Dickson White of Cornell, Charles W. Eliot of Harvard, Theodore Dwight Woolsey of Yale, Frederick Barnard of Columbia, James McCosh of Princeton, E. Benjamin Andrews of Brown, Martin B. Anderson of Rochester and, of course, William B. Rogers of MIT.  The transition in social science from amateurs to professionals is reflected inside the ASSA after 1872, when academics began to take charge of the departments - e.g. C.W. Eliot took over ""Education"", Emory Washburn over ""Jurisprudence"", etc. . The moribund ""Finance"" section was split into two departments in 1874 - ""Finance"" (under David A. Welles, then W.G. Sumner from 1875) and ""Social Economy"" (under W.B. Rogers), bringing the number of departments in the ASSA to five. Economists of the time (e.g. David A. Wells, Arthur L. Perry, Francis Lieber, Amasa Walker, Francis A. Walker, William Graham Sumner, Edward Atkinson) tended to concentrate in the ""Finance"" department, leaving ""Social Economy"" to the social activists. The ASSA spawned numerous social reform organizations, such as the National Prison Association (1870), the National Conference of Charities (1874) and the American Health Association (1874), which often met in parallel sessions at Saratoga or other venues. But by the late 1870s, as the academics took control, the papers presented at the main conference began becoming increasingly theoretical, dealing with general policy questions, like trade, currency and taxation, without attachment to any particular social reform cause.  By the early 1880s, the ""Finance"" section of the ASSA was essentially a scientific association of professional economists. The big thing of the ASSA was its annual national conference, where people from all over the country met. In the 1880s, as social scientists were finally setting themselves up in universities as professional academics, it quickly dawned that this was a unique opportunity for holding parallel conferences on more exclusively academic topics they were researching. The Johns Hopkins academics were the first to part ways and use the annual ASSA meeting to set up exclusive sessions for themselves, without the confusing hoi polloi of amateurs. The historians, under Herbert Baxter Adams, defected first, founding the American Historical Association (AHA) in 1884. This was followed up by the economists, under Richard T. Ely, who founded the American Economic Association (AEA) in 1886. These moves had encouraged by Hopkins president Gilman as a way to raise Hopkins's national profile. The Penn economists (James, Patten) actually protested the creation of the AEA. They disliked the professional character of the AEA and the segregation of economics from the other social sciences. They urged economists should stay under the ""Economics"" and ""Finance"" sections of the ASSA meetings as the best avenue to fulfill its social reform function. They saw the AHA & AEA defections as a Hopkins-engineered gambit to take over the profession. As the ASSA was impotent to prevent it, and hobbled as a result, the Penn economists struck out on their own and founded their own association, more in line with the original open ASSA spirit. The Philadelphia branch of the ASSA  was one of the more active branches anyway, so it was not too hard to elevate that branch into a new American Academy of Political and Social Science (AAPSS, f.1889). Further specialization in the late 1890s and early 1900s finally separated economics from sociology from political science, and professors in the latter wanted their own professional association.  The political scientists formed their own American Political Science Association (APSA) in 1903, and the sociologists formed the American Sociological Society (now ASA) in 1905.  With the academics all gone into their own associations, the ASSA was hallowed out, and basically wound up by 1909. The current mid-winter meetings of the AEA are held under an umbrella called ""Allied Social Science Association"" (ASSA).  This is unrelated to the original ASSA, but the choice of acronym, if not deliberate, is a fortuitous coincidence.  It is right and proper that the the current meetings still evoke the memory of the great Saratoga meetings of the American Social Science Association, the mother of them all.

American Economic Association (AEA)," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the American Economic Association or any other organization. See the official A.E.A. website] The American Economic Association (AEA) was founded in Saratoga in 1885.  Foundation Up until the 1880s, economics, and social sciences generally, had been the province of amateurs. American colleges  were dominated by clerics, and had long adhered to a traditional curriculum dominated by ancient classics  (Latin, Greek, mathematics), and next-to-no modern subjects were taught. Only in the final year were senior students given a generic ""moral philosophy"" or ""political philosophy"" course to inculcate finishing students with a general outlook on man and society.  This was traditionally taught by the college president himself, or outsourced to a multi-faceted ""moral philosophy"" teacher. Although focused on ethics, law and politics, some lectures on economics were always included as part of this final year course.  Pressure for curricular reform had led to some experimentation in the 1850s, such as the setting up of ""scientific schools"" to teach modern subjects (economics included), but they were usually kept strictly segregated from the main college.  As a result, the economics profession primarily constituted a variety of social reform activists and a coterie of clerical ""moral philosophy"" teachers.  The American ""clerical economists"" (e.g. McVickar at Columbia, Bowen at Harvard) loosely adhered to British Ricardian Classicism and its laissez faire tenets (although several were proponents of ""American System"" protectionism).  Things began to change after the end of the Civil War in 1865. The composition of college population changed, with the enrollment of greater numbers, especially older students and women, for whom a traditional classical education seemed inappropriate. Colleges gradually began expanding their curricula to include modern subjects and looking for new hires to teach them.  They found them among the ""new generation"" of American scholars, who had gone abroad for graduate training in German universities, and came home looking for academic positions. German-trained Americans began as a trickle in the early 1870s, but turned into a flood by the 1880s.  .The curricular reform in the old colleges were joined by a slate of new modern universities established by the private fortunes of  Gilded Age magnates like Ezra Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Leland Stanford, Jonas Clark, Joseph Wharton,  John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, etc.  While there were only three professors of economics in the United States in 1880, there were twenty chairs in the subject by 1890, and fifty-one by 1900.  The German-trained ""New Generation"" economists brought along a different view of economics.  Trained in the empirical methods of the German Historical School, and imbibed in its fervor for Statist ideas, they promptly challenged the theoretical approach and laissez-faire ideology of the conservative old guard of American colleges.  They also had a different idea of the role of the economist in society   In Germany, economics professors were not mere teachers, but prominent professionals, who enjoyed a particularly high status as technical experts, connected as advisors to the upper echelons of the Prussian-German State, and influential public leaders of social reform.  .Tying it together was the Verein f√ºr Socialpolitik (f.1873). a Historicist-dominated association of professional economists with the explicit aim for economic and social reform.  The New Generationists had a similar vision for the fledgling profession in the United States.  At the time, the closest thing to a association inhabited by economists was the American Statistical Association (ASA, f.1839) and, more prominently, the ""finance"" section of the American Social Science Association (ASSA, f. 1865).  The ASSA was not an academic organization, but a social reform organization, founded by a group of urban charities, centered in New England and New York. Its intent was to bring together educated people of various backgrounds (activists, teachers, clerics, charity workers, businessmen, politicians, etc.) in contact with each other, to present their findings, and coordinate with each other on proposals to address problems in northeastern cities brought about by rapid urbanization, mass immigration and industrialization (e.g. public health, sanitation, education, urban planning, police and penal system, labor standards, etc.).  The big event of the ASSA was its annual national conference, which (from 1876 on) met yearly in Saratoga, a small resort town in upstate New York. In the 1880s, as social scientists were finally setting themselves up in universities as professional academics, it quickly dawned that the annual ASSA conference was a unique opportunity for holding parallel meetings among themselves.  Academics from the Johns Hopkins University were the first to part ways and use the annual ASSA meeting to set up exclusive sessions for themselves, segregated from the hoi polloi of amateurs. The historians, under Herbert Baxter Adams, defected first, founding the American Historical Association (AHA) in 1884.  This inspired his close Hopkins colleague, Richarrd T. Ely to gather up the economists and found the ""American Economic Association"" (AEA) the very next year (1885), drawing on the same rolls.  These moves had been encouraged by Johns Hopkins president Daniel Coit Gilman as a way to raise the national profile of the fledgling university.  But Ely had a second, more overriding, interest - to galvanize the ""New Generation"" of German-trained young American economists, in common cause against the old academic guard.  Ely had just come out of a bruising methodenstreit inside Hopkins with Simon Newcomb, an astronomer-turned-economist of the older apologist stripe, who denounced the historicism of Ely and the New Generation as ""unsound"" and ""unscientific"" and their ideas on State intervention as ""socialism"" in all but name.  Indeed, the conservatives, led by Newcomb and Laughlin, had organized first, founding the ""Political Economy Club"" in 1883, on the model of the exclusive Ricardian London club of the same name, to rally for laissez faire, free trade and sound money.  The early members of the AEA divided over whether to conceive itself as an organization with broad membership (like the ASSA had been) or a narrower academic-oriented one.  Many, including Ely himself, originally nurtured visions of the AEA becoming a applied and social policy body, an American version of the German Verein f√ºr Socialpolitik (f.1873) with a goal to influence the general public and politicians, and push for social and economic reform.  Its original provisional platform was composed in the Spring of 1885 (see Ely, 1886, p.6). Its explicit aim was the ""education of public opinion in regard to economic questions and economic literature"".  The Ely manifesto  included professions of Historicist faith such as ""we regard the State as an educational and ethical agency whose positive aid is an indispensable condition of human progress"", that ""laissez faire is unsafe in politics and unsound in morals"" and ""we believe in the existence of a system of social ethics"". It rejected the economic theory ""of the past generation"" and demanded a new scientific economics based not on speculative inquiry but on ""the aid of statistics in the present, and history in the past"".  It made explicit recognition of the ""conflict of labor and capital"", and that a solution needed the ""united efforts of church, state and science"", but that in the matter of restrictions on trade and protection ""we take no partisan attitude"".  The provisional platform was circulated as a prospectus among American economists, and a founding meeting arranged at the Bethesda Parish Building in Saratoga, New York (Sep 8-11, 1885) to coincide with the conference of the ASSA and AHA (of which many economists were members; see partial list of participants).  Ely's provisional platform was discussed at Saratoga, and broadly agreed with, although objections were raised to the negative tone of some of its statements.  Although diluted (e.g. the condemnation of laissez faire and past economics was omitted), Ely's platform was incorporated as a ""statement of principles"" in Art III in the first AEA constitution (1885 Const). The American Economic Association was formally founded on September 9, 1885 in Saratoga.  While Ely managed to rope in the venerable General Francis Amasa Walker (then president of MIT) as the first President of AEA, New Generationists filled in the rest of the offices - John Bates Clark (then at Smith College), Henry Carter Adams (then at Cornell) and Edmund J. James (Penn) were the first vice-presidents, Richard T. Ely (Johns Hopkins) himself was installed as the first secretary and E.R.A. Seligman (Columbia). as treasurer.  Local ""branch associations"" were established in several American cities, notably Connecticut Valley (CT), Buffalo (NY), Galesburg (Ill), Washington (DC), Orange (NJ), Canton (OH) and Austin (TX). The idea for the AEA had arguably preceded Ely.  While graduate students in Halle, Germany, the Pennsylvania economists Edmund J. James and Simon Nelson Patten had come up with a draft proposal to establish an American equivalent of the German Verein f√ºr Socialpolitik, to fight the influence of liberal ""British"" economics in America, and embrace a more ""German"" economics (with its more protectionist, interventionist tenets).  But Ely pipped them to the punch with his 1885 manifesto, articulating similar Verein-like principles and goals.  The Pennsylvanians were not completely convinced by the AEA. Institutional rivalry fueled suspicions that it was a bid by Johns Hopkins to assume control of the academic profession.  Moreover, they were never quite reconciled to the AEA's overt goal of segregating economists from the rest of the social sciences, and initially argued for remaining inside the ""finance section"" of the ASSA.  When the AEA began moving in a more pronouncedly professional direction after 1887, the Penn economists founded the American Academy for Political and Social Science in 1889, merging with the Pennsylvania branch of the ASSA, in order to maintain the connection to other social sciences and social reform. Despite its initial radicalism, the AEA quickly became a broad professional organization as opposed to a narrower and more partisan association.  In December 1887, the AEA Council proposed to amend the constitution to remove the radical ""statement of principles"" of the 1885 constitution, and a new constitution was adopted at the third annual meeting in Philadelphia in December 1888 (Report p.314). Nonetheless, the new constitution remained overtly Historicist in tone, including as its object: """"the encouragement of economic research, especially the historical and statistical study of the actual conditions of economic life"" (1890, Art II), while simultaneously promising ""perfect freedom of economic discussion"".. Its social reform objectives also continued - among its early resolutions were requests to establish committees on hot policy topics like labor working hours, women in factories, municipal finance, public works, rent, a national railroad commission, suffrage in local elections, transportation and the silver question (1890: res).  If ""New Generation"" proto-Institutionalists were overrepresented in the early membership rolls of the AEA, it was also because the ""old school"" American economists - such as Laughlin, Sumner, Taussig and Hadley - refused to join. They viewed the AEA suspiciously as a socialistic organization.  However, most of their misgivings were allayed after Ely's resignation as secretary in 1892.  The AEA was set more firmly on a professional tack, unattached to any particular school of thought, as new Neoclassicals and even old school apologists began gradually joining it (Laughlin, however, continued to refuse throughout his career, and chided Taussig for breaking ranks and consorting with the upstarts). Ely's ""loss of control"" of the AEA was not taken kindly his fellow travelers, and provoked a new split in 1895: the creation of the ""Political Science Association"" (PSA). The name was deceptive. It was an economics association, chock-full of bona fide economists - mainly Institutionalist economists from the Midwest, who had been former colleagues and students of Ely (notably HC Adams at Michigan and John Commons, then at Indiana; Ely himself had moved to Wisconsin in 1892). Disappointed by the neutral turn of the AEA, the PSA explicitly ""restored"" the original political and social reform goals of the original AEA. Although the PSA diplomatically assured the AEA that it was not a rival organization, but merely a regional one, limited to the Midwest, it was nonetheless perceived as a threat. The PSA charged that the AEA was dominated by eastern economists, that meetings were always east of the Alleghenies, negligent of the needs and struggles of Midwestern states, and the pressure which Midwestern economists were under in their universities (this was the height of agrarian socialism and the Bryan campaign, where Midwestern economists being asked to pick sides). The threat of schism prompted the AEA to hold joint meetings with the PSA in Indianapolis (Commons's base) in 1895 and elected HC Adams as president to mollify the midwesterners. The PSA lingered on as a regional organization, but its schismatic character dissipated when Ely was unexpectedly elected president of the AEA in 1899, healing some of the old rifts. Curiously, it was only in 1925, and after some energetic lobbying efforts by Paul H. Douglas, that the AEA finally got around to offering Institutionalist icon Thorstein Veblen the presidency of the AEA - which Veblen, of course, refused with pleasure. Publications From the beginning, the American Economic Association began putting out the Publications of the AEA, in 1886, as a bi-monthly series. R.T. Ely had originally wanted the Pub AEA to serve as something akin to policy briefs, rather than pure academic fare.  But over time it became more consciously academic. The Pub AEA was not a journal properly speaking, but more like a monograph or occasional paper series - each number usually contained a single study by a single author.  Only the number dedicated to the ""Papers & Proceedings"" of the annual AEA conference had multiple articles.  For a brief period, (1896-99), a bi-monthly series, including the proceedings, was published under a new title Economic Studies, reserving the Publications title for irregular briefs (""new series"").  This was soon discontinued, and the Publications of the AEA was re-launched as a more regular quarterly (""third series"") in 1900. Nonetheless, it  still remained mainly a monograph series, save for the conference proceedings number, which contained multiple papers and discussions. In 1908, Pub AEA was re-titled American Economic Association Quarterly, and a separate series, consisting entirely of book reviews, began to be published separately as a new quarterly, the Economic Bulletin. In 1911, the Publications of AEA and the Economic Bulletin were discontinued, and the AEA launched a single new quarterly journal, the American Economic Review (AER). .It was now determined to be a quarterly academic journal, with multiple articles per issue number. There were four numbers per year (March, June, Sep, Dec), with an additional fifth number of ""Papers and Proceedings"" (May).  It maintained that structure for the next century. The AER was designed in 1911 to compete with the rising economics journals put by other institutions - notably Columbia's Political Science Quarterly (PSQ, begun 1886), Harvard's Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE, 1886), Chicago's Journal of Political Economy (JPE, 1892), the Annals of  the American Academy of Political and Social Science (AAPSS, 1890) and the British Royal Economic Society's Economic Journal (EJ, 1890).  The AER quickly muscled itself into the top of the heap. In its early years, the American Economic Review was (and remains) aimed at a relatively wide audience and thus articles which were too technical or mathematical rarely found their way into the AER. To a certain extent, this anti-technical bias was also found in other contemporary American journals.  Nonetheless, this proved intolerable for technically-inclined economists - and a rival, worldwide organization, the ""Econometric Society"" and its journal Econometrica, was set up in the 1930s to fill the void left by the AER and other conventional journals.  As the technical language of economics advanced, the AER has admitted increasingly technical papers - although its wide audience does not permit it to overextend itself in this respect.  In the late 20th Century, the AEA introduced two additional quarterly journals to help its dissemination mission.  The Journal of Economic Literature (begun 1963 as the Journal of Economic Abstracts, but recast as JEL in 1969)  usually contains a few wide literature surveys, book reviews and annotated listings of new articles and abstracts in economics, is the reference journal of the profession. The Journal of Economic Perspectives (begun 1987) devoted exclusively to accessible articles and surveys of economic ideas and debates, serves as the communication line between increasingly specialized and often incomprehensible professional economists and the more general public. Starting in 2011, with the 100th volume, the AER abandoned its long-standing quarterly structure began publishing bi-monthly (six numbers a year - February, April, June, August, October, December) with an additional seventh volume of Papers & Proceedings (still May). .From 2014, the AER has become a monthly (12 numbers per year). In addition to its three long-standing journals (AER, JEL, JEP), the AEA recently (since 2009) began publishing four ""field journals"".  All of them are prefixed American Economic Journal, with specific subtitle Applied Economics, Economic Policy, Macroeconomics and Microeconomics.  The AEJ field journals, all of them quarterlies, were designed as outlets to handle the surge of new articles, and to give economists an alternative to the high-cost specialized journals put out by commercial houses.  AEA meetings Following up in the tradition of the old ASSA, the AEA continued to hold annual mid-winter meetings (usually early January), in conjunction with other associations under the overarching title of ""Allied Social Science Association"" (ASSA).   These have sometimes been a cause of consternation because the programs, usually organized the presidents, naturally exhibit their personal preferences and thus often exclude issues and groups which they dislike or feel do not deserve a hearing. Although many presidents attempt to be magnanimous in their coverage, heterodox economics is sometimes shunted out of the formal AEA conference programs - although many heterodox organizations set up their own separate meetings at the same time. Another accusation that the AEA has also borne in the past is that it is biased in its very lack of bias! At the very start, Ely & Co. sought to make the AEA an advocacy organization, with specific policy goals, but this was resisted.  Since then, for the most part, the AEA has adhered to the idea that it should make no pronouncements, as an organization, regarding any economic, social or political programs. The one exception to this rule is that it (sometimes) speaks, as an organization, against political attempts by governments to curtail freedom of speech and academic research. Some economists have felt uncomfortable with that narrow position. The AEA's refusal to take a position about the Vietnam War during the 1960s, for example, divided its members. AEA honors and awards The American Economic Association has also been a fountainhead of professional accolades and honors for economists to gather over time and attach to their sleeves. Ever since 1885, the American Economic Association has elected a member of the American profession to its presidency more on the basis of merit than on organizational ability. Its most watched award is perhaps the John Bates Clark Medal - which as instituted in the 1940s and is traditionally awarded every second year (now yearly) to a promising young economist under the age of forty. Every year since 1962 it also gives out a Distinguished Fellow award to one or two American economists (increased to three, then four, in recent years) - perhaps in fear that deserving economists might miss out on the more conventional awards. Previous to the Nobel Memorial Prize, the most prestigious prize in economics might have been the Francis A. Walker Medal, awarded every five years for outstanding lifetime achievements. It was discontinued after 1977, ostensibly because the Nobel Memorial Prize made it superfluous, even though they are not perfect substitutes.  The Walker medal - like the Clark medal and Distinguished Fellow award - was exclusive to economists working in the United States (while the Nobel Memorial Prize is open to all countries).  The AEA instituted the special award of ""Foreign Honorary Member"" to distinguished economists working in other countries. In the 1960s, the AEA instituted the Richard T. Ely Lecture, an address given by renowned economists at the annual AEA Conference - which is not confined, as its other awards usually are, to American economists.. The Richard T. Ely Lecture and the Presidential Address to the AEA are often the two favorite places that the great elders of the profession finally get to air their long-held opinions and complaints about the field, and so have a tradition of being rather firecracker lectures.      Lists Presidents of the American Economic Association The Francis A. Walker Medal Instituted in 1947 by the American Economic Association and awarded every five years to established economist for lifetime work, or rather ""to the living American economist who in the judgment of the awarding body has during his career made the greatest contribution to economics"". Named after early American economist, Francis Amasa Walker. The creation of the Nobel Memorial Prize has ostensibly made the Walker Medal effectively superfluous as a cap on a career, and the Walker medal was discontinued in 1981. John Bates Clark Medal Instituted in 1947 by the American Economic Association and awarded every second year (annually since 2009) to a promising young economist - i.e. ""to that American economist under the age of forty who is adjudged to have made a significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge"". Named after early Neoclassical economist, John Bates Clark, it is widely considered to be the profession's most coveted award -- exceeding, perhaps, even the Nobel Memorial Prize in prestige.  Richard T. Ely Lectures Distinguished lecture to the AEA, instituted in 1962 and not confined to Americans. Named after one of the founders of the AEA, Richard T. Ely. Distinguished Fellows Established by the AEA in 1965, this is awarded annually to not more than two ""economists of high distinction in the United States and Canada"".  The number was increased to ""not more than three"" in 2002-03 and to ""no more than four"" in 2010-11. All Walker medallists and presidents were awarded the title of ""Distinguished Fellow"" automatically.  To highlight specifically elected distinguished fellows, we omit the ex oficio fellows from this list .  Traditionally, portraits of the president appeared in the March (No.1)  issue of the AER, and the distinguished fellows in June (No. 2) and September (No.3).  After 2003, the third fellow appeared in the December issue (No.4).  With the reorganization in 2011 of the AER to six numbers per year, and distinguished fellows to four, the portrait of the President now appears in April (No.2), and distinguished fellows appear in June (No.4), August (No.5), October (No.6) and December (No.7) in the year after their service.

American Academy of Political and Social Science (AAPSS)," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the AAPSS or any other organization. See the official AAPSS website] The American Academy of Social and Political Science (AAPSS) was founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on December 14, 1889, at a conference with 22 members.  Most were teachers at local-area colleges (notably Pennsylavnia, Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr).  At this time, there were three societies already in existence whose researchers overlapped into the social sciences - the American Statistical Association (f.1839), the American Social Science Association (f.1865), the American Economic Association (f.1885).  The AAPSS was designed as a successor to the second of these, the SSA. The SSA had been originally founded in Boston in 1865 by a group of American social reformers, under the title ""American Association for the Promotion of Social Science"" (only later renamed ""Social Science Association"").  It was modeled on an equivalent British society, the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science (NAPSS) founded by Henry Brougham in 1857.  Neither the NAPSS in Britain nor the SSA in the US were academic-oriented institutions.  Rather, they were designed as networks of social reformers of various backgrounds (academics, activists, professionals, businessmen, government officials, etc.).  The associations put them in touch with each other and in communication with politicians, in order to coordinate a variety of social reforms and bring them into legislation, e.g. on public health, sanitation, education, penal reform, trade unions, etc.  They organized a large annual conference, where papers, studies and proposals were presented by the reformers.  As social science became professionalized and legislatures started commissioning their own research, the need for these societies gradually fell away.  The British NAPSS was defunct by 1886 and  the American SSA was moribund, wounded by the creation of the AEA.  Indeed, the SSA had never really been very vigorous.  As most relevant legislation on social reforms tended to be conducted at the state level, rather than federal, the SSA had been little more than a national umbrella for various state-level associations, and the degree of activity of the state associations varied enormously.  The Pennsylvania Social Science Association in Philadelphia was one of the most active, and grew impatient with the lethargic leadership of the distant SSA in Boston. Pennsylvania social reformers decided to break off and form the spearhead of their own national association. The American Academy of Political and Social Science (AAPSS) was formed in 1889 on the initiative of Pennsylvania-area academics, notably Edmund J. James of the University of Pennsylvania and Franklin H. Giddings of Bryn Mawr, most of whom had been active participants in the Pennsylvania branch of the Social Science Association, and annexed the latter after its creation.  They founded their own journal, the Annals of the AAPSS in 1890. It was dedicated to producing short articles summarizing the most recent scholarly research in the social sciences in an accessible manner for public consumption and politicians, with the goal of informing and affecting social policy.  A substantial part of its early articles were dedicated to economics.  For some time, the Annals competed with other economics journals, and was sometimes regarded as the ""house journal"" of Penn's economics department, comparable to Columbia's PSQ, Harvard's QJE and Chicago's JPE.  However, the Annals of the AAPSS never morphed into purely academic economics journal.  As professionalization deepened, the AAPSS maintained its wide embrace of the social sciences, and its mission of connecting scholarly research with social policy.  The economists who dominated its early years have since given way to sociologists, political scientists, criminologists, and others.

Verein f√ºr Socialpolitik
The Econometric Society"," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the Verein f√ºr Socialpolitik  or any other organization. See the official Verein f√ºr Socialpolitik website] The Verein f√ºr Socialpolitik (literally, ""Association for Social Policy"") is a professional organization of German-speaking economists.  It was originally founded in 1873, as a bastion of the German Historical School. Its roots are in a series of studies written around 1870-71 by several German academics - notably Gustav Schmoller, Adolph Wagner, Albert Sch√§ffle, Gustav von Sch√∂nberg and Lujo Brentano - examining the impact of industrial capitalism and free trade on the social order.  The academic studies called for State intervention to mitigate the pernicious effects of competition on the working classes and vulnerable members of society.   Their studies faced immediate hostility from the German liberal parties and press, who denounced their proposals as nothing short of socialism.  Surprised by the vigor of the assault, the academics tried to reply and a vigorous controversy raged in the German press.  The German Historicists earned their appellation as Kathedersozialisten (""Socialists of the (professorial) chair"") during this controversy - a moniker apparently coined by the liberal publicist H.B. Oppenheim. In this initial round of polemics, the academics were no match for the established political parties and their newspapers, and realized they must also organize if they hoped to reach public opinion.  The initiative came out of discussions between Hamburg publicist Julius von Eckhardt and Berlin professor Adolph Wagner, who roped in Gustav Schmoller (then at Halle) to do the legwork.    A group of 22 academic economists invited by Schmoller met at Halle in July 1872, and agreed they needed a forum where they could explain their ideas better.  The result was the conference in Eisenach on October 6-7, 1872 bringing together most of the academic economists in Germany, as well as representatives of trade unions, political parties and businesses, for a debate on the ""Social Question"" (""die soziale Frage""). It was arguably the first time academics scattered across Germany had come together, into direct contact with each other, and agreed to form an association to better coordinate with each other, to answer their critics and push for social reforms.  The next year, at another conference in Eisenach (Oct 12-13, 1873), the Verein f√ºr Socialpolitik was formally launched. [Note: although the Verein is sometimes dated as founded in 1872, its formal foundation was a year later, in 1873; the two Eisenach conferences should not be confused.  Note also that the original spelling of the organization - ""Socialpolitik"" - is retained to this day as a historical legacy, even though modern German spelling would have rendered it ""Sozialpolitik"".]     Among the economists at the founding meeting were Gustav Schmoller (now at Strasbourg), Adolph Wagner (Berlin), Lujo Brentano (Breslau), Johannes Conrad  (Halle),  Georg F..Knapp (Leipzig), Karl Knies (Heidelberg), Adolf Held (Bonn), Erwin Nasse (Bonn), Friedrich Julius Neumann (Freiburg), Gustav von Sch√∂nberg  (Tubingen) and Ernst Engel (Berlin Statistical Bureau).  Rudolf von Gneist (Berlin) was elected the first chairman of the Verein, and Adolf Held its first secretary.  Erwin Nasse was elected president in 1874, and held until his death in 1890. Conspicuous in their absence were academics from outside of the the German Reich - notably the Vienna professors Albert Sch√§ffle and Lorenz von Stein.  Although, in principle, the Verein was open up to any German-speaking economists, including those in Austria-Hungary and Switzerland, it was widely perceived as an exclusively Prussian-German thing, particularly given its political interface with the Bismarckian government in newly-unified Germany.  Despite repeated invitations, most Austrians refused to join - believing the Verein both ""too Socialist and too Prussian"" for their tastes. It has been argued that the Verein  f√ºr Socialpolitik was the first professional organization of economists in the world.  Although prior organizations dedicated to, or at least intersecting with, economics already existed in Britain, France and even Germany itself, they were not quite as academic.  The Verein's chief competition in Germany was the Volkwirthschaflich Gessellschaft zu Berlin (""Economic Society of Berlin"", f.1858), the most prominent regional subsidiary of the Kongre√ü deutscher Volkswirte (""Congress of German Economists"").  The VG was the successor of the Deutscher Freihandelsverein, the free trade association launched in 1846 by the English-born laissez faire activist John Prince-Smith.  The VG not only preceded the Verein, but also outnumbered it for quite some time. .  Nonetheless, the Verein was more academic, and focused on using research and publications to influence policy at the top, rather than by ground-roots political organization, public debates and dissemination of propaganda.  But the Verein did not initially see itself as a purely professional or academic affair, but rather the kernel of a political movement, with the explicit goal to affect public policy. It promoted active government social policy as a ""third way"" between Manchester school laissez faire liberalism (advocated by the VG and parties like the DFP) and outright socialist revolution (advocated by Marxists and parties like the SPD).  In many respects, the Verein were the academic cheerleaders (if not the voice) of the Bismarckian government's economic policies.  After the liberals were split and socialists banned in 1878, Bismarck pushed protectionism and a groundbreaking slate of social welfare institutions through the German Reichstag during the 1880s.  After the policies were in place and the controversies died own (the VG was defunct by 1885), the Verein became a larger tent for academics of various shades of opinion, only notionally retaining its overall goal for social reform. The Verein set the model and was the direct inspiration for organizations like the Italian Associazone per il progresso degli studi economici (f.1875),  the American Economic Association (f.1885) and, more distantly, the British Economic Association (f.1890).

The Econometric Society," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the Econometric Society or any other organization. See the official Econometric Society website] The 1920s were not a good time to be a Neoclassical theorist, particularly if one had a mathematical bent.  The Marginalist Revolution had basically petered out by then. The Institutionalist and Historicist schools dominated economics in America and the European continent.  In Great Britain, it had given way to the avowedly non-mathematical Marshallian School.  The few mathematically-minded Neoclassical economists that existed were scattered obscurely around the world.  In the English-speaking world, Irving Fisher had long been the sole voice in defense of Neoclassical formalism.  In 1912, he had tried to bring mathematical economists together into a society for professional advancement, but to no avail.  Channels for the exposition of mathematical economics had failed to grow in the interim.  With the possible exception of the Italian Giornale degli economisti, most economics journals had explicit or implicit editorial policies against publishing articles with mathematical content.   According to G√©rard Debreu,  the entire 1933 volume of the American Economic Review ""contained exactly four pages where any mathematical symbol appeared, and two of them were in the Book Review Section"" (Debreu, 1991). In 1928, prodded by the young Ragnar Frisch and Charles F. Roos, Fisher took up the issue of a society for mathematical economists again.    Fisher agreed to support it if one hundred economists could be found to charter it.  Frisch and Roos could come up with only eighty tentative names. A letter signed by Fisher, Frisch and Roos was sent out in June 1930 to these eighty economists to test its viability and get more suggestions for members.  Frisch had came up with the term ""econometrie"" in 1926 and, after undergoing much wrangling over alternative spellings (e.g. ""Oekonometrika"", ""Econometrika"", etc.), ""Econometric Society"" was decided upon. On December 29th, 1930, sixteen people gathered at the Stalton Hotel in Cleveland Ohio: Frisch, Roos,  Joseph A. Schumpeter, Harold Hotelling, Henry Schultz, Karl Menger, Edwin B. Wilson, Frederick C. Mills, William F. Ogburn, J. Harvey Rogers, Malcolm C. Rorty, Carl Snyder, W. A. Shewhart, Oystein Ore, Ingvar Wedervang and Norbert Wiener).  These became the founders of ""The Econometric Society, an International Society for the Advancement of Economic Theory in its Relation with Statistics and Mathematics"".  Aptly, its first academic meetings were held in September 1931 in Lausanne, Switzerland.  It had 173 charter members. The Constitution of the society, largely written by Frisch, was almost guild-like in its structure, a self-perpetuating society of ""Fellows"" who nominated the scholars that were to enter into their ranks.  Membership was wider, but all power remained in the hands of the Fellows.  The Fellows elect the ruling Council.  The Econometric Society's first president was Irving Fisher and its first council members included Frisch, Roos, Schumpeter, Wilson, Luigi Amoroso, Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, Arthur Bowley, Fran√ßois Divisia and Wl. Zadawsky.   The idea for a journal came up. The question of whether it would ""ghettoize"" mathematical economics was hotly debated, but it was the question of financing that made it particularly knotty.  In 1931, the American businessman, Alfred Cowles, offered to help finance the entire venture.  Cowles also offered to fund an ""Econometric Foundation"", but this was vigorously resisted by the European members, fearing that it might compromise the independence of the Econometric Society itself.  A compromise was reached and the separate Cowles Commission for Economic Research was founded in 1932.  Cowles himself stayed on to serve as treasurer and circulation manager for the Econometric Society.  For a while, the Econometric Society and the Cowles Commission shared the same offices in Colorado Springs.  The journal, Econometrica, was launched in January 1933 with Ragnar Frisch as Editor-in-Chief and a circulation of 300.  Articles could be submitted in English or French (and occasionally German) and there were no restraints on the degree of mathematical content.   There was a sufficiently large backlog of mathematical economics papers to make its first few issues relatively large.  But this pool quickly dried up.  Two other journals, the Vienna-based Zeitschrift f√ºr National√∂konomie (re-founded 1929) and the Review of Economic Studies (founded 1933 by L.S.E. students) competed for papers in high theory.  As such, Econometrica quickly became surprisingly thin.  To ""bulk it up"" -- and to bring mathematical economics to a wider audience -- Frisch commissioned a series of famous yearly surveys on Equilibrium Theory, Business Cycle Theory, Statistical Techniques and Statistical Information. After a few famous initial contributions (e.g. Marschak (1933), Tinbergen (1935), Hicks (1935), Frisch (1936)), these were eventually discontinued as regular pieces.  Only occasionally surveys were commissioned for the next half-century (e.g. Negishi (1962)).   Frisch also commissioned a series of articles on famous mathematical economists.   Thus we find  the classic biographical pieces by √Ökerman on Wicksell, Roy on Cournot, Schneider on von Thunen, Hicks  on Walras, Bowley on Edgeworth and, perhaps most controversially, Amoroso on Pareto. Also, important historical pieces such as the Jevons-Walras correspondence and Slutsky's 1915 article were reprinted. A good part of the Paretian Revival of the 1930s was played out in Econometrica (e.g. Hotelling, 1938,  Lange, 1942, etc.).   It was also the home of Kalecki's first English-language publication (1935) on macrodynamics. Hicks contributed his famous 1937 ""Mr Keynes and Classics"" paper, launching Neo-Keynesian macroeconomics.  But perhaps its most immediately significant piece was Haavelmo's 1944 ""Probability Approach"" paper which laid the foundation for modern econometrics.  During World War II, Econometrica foundered a bit as European universities were thrown in an upheaval and many mathematical economists scattered.  From 1942 to 1946, Oskar Lange of Chicago took over temporarily as editor because  Frisch, then in German-occupied Norway, had been unable to continue his duties (the University of Oslo was closed and Frisch sat in prison for one year).   The late 1940s and early 1950s saw an explosion in mathematical economics -- much of it arising from the research programs that stemmed in part from the Cowles Commission.  Besides the ""Cowles"" approach to econometrics, the most significant was the launch of Neo-Walrasian general equilibrium theory.  The famous existence theorems of Arrow and Debreu (1954) and McKenzie (1959)  were published in Econometrica.  The series of Arrow -Hurwicz papers of the late 1950s-early 1960s on stability theory were also published here. The prestige of the Econometric Society and Econometrica rose over time, both driving and echoing the increasing mathematization of the discipline as a whole.  Many have viewed this movement as having gone too far, to the point to which Econometrica has, it is charged, became inaccessible to most economists.  This has been a perennial source of complaint.  As Evsey Domar once cracked, ""the only connection I have with econometricians is the $8 I pay every year for their incomprehensible journal.""  In1958, Joan Robinson declined an invitation to serve on council of the Econometric Society, noting that she could not very well serve as an overseer of a journal she could not read. Ragnar Frisch's tenure as Editor-in-Chief of Econometrica lasted until 1955, but the imprint he left at the journal was deep.  After his departure, Econometrica began to swerve away from abstract theoretical economics and econometrics and towards more applied empirical studies -- a swing that has ebbed at times but remains pronounced to this day.   The Econometric Society has gradually evolved from a guerilla cell of mathematical mavericks to the most prestigious club in the economics profession.  Today, being elected a Fellow to the Econometric Society is widely regarded as one of the highest achievements of any professional economist.   As bizarre as it sounds, several top departments in the United States often make the request that a junior professor have at least one publication in Econometrica if he is to have any hope for tenure.   The very ""institutionalization"" of the Society has also made it a little bit dull.  The controversial polemics, the crusading spirit and the energy of scientific advance that could be felt in the early years of the Society have diminished considerably.  To look for a trace of that old spirit today, we would probably have to turn to the Journal of Economic Theory, Economic Theory or the Journal of Mathematical Economics.

"Research Institutes
The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)
The Kiel School
The Cowles Commission"," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the National Bureau for Economic Research (NBER) or any other organization. See the official NBER website] The National Bureau for Economic Research (NBER) is a private economic research institute, founded in 1920, and serves as the semi-official tabulator of the US Business Cycle. Foundation The NBER was the brainchild of Malcolm C. Rorty, an engineer-economist at AT&T.  One of Rorty's duties was to put out an AT&T house bulletin on current business conditions.  Part of that involved scanning the radical and socialist press for signs of labor unrest.  In 1916, Rorty stumbled on an article in the Intercollegiate Socialist magazine, written by Nahum I. Stone,  formerly a statistician at the US Tariff Commission, now a consultant on labor disputes. Stone's article was a review and critique of Nearing's 1916 famous study of income distribution.  Rorty entered into communication with Stone over the Nearing study, and in the course of their discussion, realized that the entire public debate on distribution then raging in the United States was marred by lack of reliable statistics on income shares.  Academics, employers, unions, journalists, etc. seemed to all be coming up with their own numbers and there was no agreement on what the facts actually were.  Rorty and Stone came up with the idea of establishing an independent committee, composed of economists of all schools of thought, and including representatives of labor and business interests, to establish an authoritative and objective statistical accounting of income distribution in the United States.   For this project, Rorty and Stone roped in three of the most prominent empirical economists of the time: Edwin F. Gay at Harvard, Wesley C. Mitchell at Columbia and John R. Commons at Wisconsin (then also serving as president of the AEA).  They were soon joined in 1917 by Allyn A. Young (then at Cornell and serving that year as president of the ASA), Thomas S. Adams (a fiscal expert at Yale), John P. Frey (a labor union journalist) and George E. Roberts (vice-president of National City Bank).  They formed the kernel of a ""Committee on the Distribution of Income"" by June 1917, and a prospectus was issued describing its objectives and seeking to raise funds.  The entry of the United States into World War I in 1917 and the problems of reconstruction after 1918 distracted the attentions of many participants, but the wartime experience also highlighted the importance and necessity of good and accurate economic statistics. The fund-raising effort resumed, and the money was finally in place in 1919, the lion's share  pledged by the Commonwealth Fund. By this time, the issue of business cycles had become a hot topic, and it was agreed that the committee should also take that on as a secondary topic.  The finalization of organization was made during the Winter meetings of the American Economic Association in Chicago in December 1919.  The ""National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc."" was formally chartered and launched on January 29, 1920.  Edwin F. Gay was to serve as the NBER's first president, and Wesley C. Mitchell was to serve as its first director of research. At its foundation, the NBER charter stated that its objective was ""To encourage, in the broadest and most liberal manner, investigation, research and discovery, and the application of knowledge to the well-being of mankind; and in particular to conduct, or assist in the making of, exact and impartial investigations in the field of economic, social and industrial science, and to this end to cooperate with governments, universities, learned societies and individuals"".  Or as it would would later clarify, """"it seeks not only to find facts and make them known, but to determine them in such manner and under such supervision as to make its findings carry conviction to Liberal and Conservative alike.""  A 19-member Board of Directors was instituted, which included a balanced representation of views and interests.  It included ex officio representatives of the AEA and ASA, as well as six designated universities (Harvard, Yale, Chicago, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania).  It also included representatives of the American Federation of Labor,  the National Bankers' Association, the National Industrial Conference Board,  Federation of Farm Bureaus, National Publishers' Association, Engineering Council, etc.  Plans to include representatives of the Federal Reserve and US departments of Treasury, Commerce and Labor were nixed as it might compromise the political independence of the NBER. (The composition of the board was rearranged in 1927, and increased to 22 directors). Research in 1920s Mitchell's initial research staff consisted of Wilford I. King, Frederick R. Macaulay and Oswald W. Knauth. They completed the founding study on income distribution in the United States within two years. It was published as two volumes in 1921-22.  The study famously presented two independent estimates of national income - one by Knauth involving income tax returns, another by King involving census and other data.  A slimmer volume by Knauth summarizing the 1919 findings by state came out a little later.  It proved a success, and persuaded the directors that the NBER should continue.  With the US reeling from the recession of 1920-21, Mitchell persuaded the NBER directors to take up business cycles as a second project.  This turn was helped when, in 1921, Herbert Hoover (then Harding's Secretary of Commerce) requested the NBER to provide reliable data on cyclical unemployment.  The Carnegie Corporation provided a grant to that end.  Knauth resigned in 1922 to take a job in the private sector (an updated edition of Knauth's income by states was completed by Maurice Leven in 1925).   To complete the Hoover Committee report on time, Leo Wolman and Willard L. Thorp were added to the research staff in 1922 (director T.S. Adams and a dozen other outside contributors also lent a hand to the Hoover study).  A supplement to the Hoover study's unemployment estimates by King came out in 1923.  In 1922, another request came, this time from the National Research Council, who proposed to fund a study on immigration. To undertake that study, Harry Jerome took leave from Wisconsin and joined the NBER staff in 1923.  Jerome's study on migration was published in 1926  Partly to deal with the expanding scope of NBER projects, Edwin F. Gay was appointed joint director of research in 1924.  Mitchell at Columbia and Gay at Harvard would serve as joint directors of research of the NBER  for the next decade.  The process of project approval was formalized shortly after.  Proposals were submitted by the directors of research to the NBER's board of directors for approval, and upon completion, nothing would go out without all the board first reading it, and voting in majority for its publication. With the board's approval, Mitchell began his own analytical treatise on business cycles in 1924, that would would eventually appear in 1927 as Business Cycles: the problem and its setting, while Willard Thorp began collecting the relevant cycle data on seventeen countries as far back to 1890 (some earlier) that would appear as Business Annals in 1926. Tangentially related to cycles, Wolman's monumental history of labor union membership was published in 1924, but a much-announced study of bond yields and interest rates over the cycle by Frederick Macaulay, begun as early as 1923, did not seem to get past the door and would not see the light of day until fifteen years later (1938).   The initial successes of the NBER had led to outside grants coming in to commission studies.  Even before the Jerome migration study was completed,  the NBER was asked by the NRC in 1925 to conduct two further studies on immigration, to be funded by the SSRC - one on the relationship between immigration and mechanization, another on international immigration patterns.  Jerome took up the former, while the venerable William F. Willcox (then at Cornell) agreed to take up the latter.  However, Jerome had to return to his teaching duties at Wisconsin in 1926, and continued only on a part-time basis.  Despite having his hands full, Jerome launched another project estimating hourly productivity, also financed by the SSRC grant.  The SSRC also provided a small grant for Wolman to undertake a study of the US labor market.  Of these new projects, only the first volume of Willcox's study on world migrations appeared before the end of the decade. In 1925, the NBER directors proposed yet another area of research: the structure of prices.  Frederick C. Mills of Columbia joined the NBER staff in 1925 to undertake this, and the resulting study was published in 1927.  Mills promptly began working on his second volume on prices.  In the meantime, with his theoretical treatise nearing completion, Mitchell began to project a second volume on business cycles, to digest Thorp's mass of data.  But Thorp had resigned from full-time at the NBER after completing his annals. To replace him, Mitchell's student Simon Kuznets joined the NBER staff in 1926, to sift through the data, loosely supervised by Thorp from a distance.  Nonetheless, Thorp continued to collect data, and announced in early 1929 his intention to publish a five-volume encyclopaedia of statistical series. Wilford I. King, charged since 1923 with undertaking a detailed study of income distribution, also much announced, also kept getting delayed.  Since Knauth's resignation, King was also responsible for updating income estimates and kept getting pestered to provide data for the periodic NBER Bulletin.  In 1926, King had to interrupt his distribution work to undertake a pilot study on philanthropic organizations on a grant from the Carnegie Corporation.  Exhausted and plagued by ill-health, King resigned from the NBER in 1927 to take up a position at NYU, leaving only the monograph on philanthropy to be published by the NBER in 1928. King's remaining work for the NBER would have to be primarily completed through assistants.   In late 1927, the Hoover Committee hit up the NBER again, requesting a survey of recent changes in the US economy since 1922.  The massive study  involved contributions from NBER staff and authors outside the NBER, supervised by Hoover committee secretary E.E. Hunt.  (Hoover himself resigned the committee half-way through to run for president; A.W. Shaw chaired the committee thereafter).  The study was finally completed in February 1929  and published in two volumes that May.  Wolman, Thorp, Mills and King (via Copeland) offered chapters based on their impending work.  It offered a comprehensive snapshot of the US economy up to the eve of the Great Depression. 1930s 1930 finally saw the publication of W.I. King's study on income, effectively updating the 1921-22 study.The NBER put out a periodic Bulletin until 1940, when it was replaced by the ""Occasional Paper"" series.  Its early crop of researchers included Wilford I. King, F.C. Macalay and Leo Wolman.  NBER stalwarts Frederick C. Mills and Simon Kuznets joined the NBER shortly after, Arthur F. Burns joined the research staff in 1933 (to be completed)      Directors of Research at the NBER       Resources on the NBER   All rights reserved, Gon√ßalo L.

See the official NBER website] The National Bureau for Economic Research (NBER) is a private economic research institute, founded in 1920, and serves as the semi-official tabulator of the US Business Cycle. Foundation The NBER was the brainchild of Malcolm C. Rorty, an engineer-economist at AT&T.  One of Rorty's duties was to put out an AT&T house bulletin on current business conditions.  Part of that involved scanning the radical and socialist press for signs of labor unrest.  In 1916, Rorty stumbled on an article in the Intercollegiate Socialist magazine, written by Nahum I. Stone,  formerly a statistician at the US Tariff Commission, now a consultant on labor disputes. Stone's article was a review and critique of Nearing's 1916 famous study of income distribution.  Rorty entered into communication with Stone over the Nearing study, and in the course of their discussion, realized that the entire public debate on distribution then raging in the United States was marred by lack of reliable statistics on income shares.  Academics, employers, unions, journalists, etc. seemed to all be coming up with their own numbers and there was no agreement on what the facts actually were.  Rorty and Stone came up with the idea of establishing an independent committee, composed of economists of all schools of thought, and including representatives of labor and business interests, to establish an authoritative and objective statistical accounting of income distribution in the United States.   For this project, Rorty and Stone roped in three of the most prominent empirical economists of the time: Edwin F. Gay at Harvard, Wesley C. Mitchell at Columbia and John R. Commons at Wisconsin (then also serving as president of the AEA).  They were soon joined in 1917 by Allyn A. Young (then at Cornell and serving that year as president of the ASA), Thomas S. Adams (a fiscal expert at Yale), John P. Frey (a labor union journalist) and George E. Roberts (vice-president of National City Bank).  They formed the kernel of a ""Committee on the Distribution of Income"" by June 1917, and a prospectus was issued describing its objectives and seeking to raise funds.  The entry of the United States into World War I in 1917 and the problems of reconstruction after 1918 distracted the attentions of many participants, but the wartime experience also highlighted the importance and necessity of good and accurate economic statistics. The fund-raising effort resumed, and the money was finally in place in 1919, the lion's share  pledged by the Commonwealth Fund. By this time, the issue of business cycles had become a hot topic, and it was agreed that the committee should also take that on as a secondary topic.  The finalization of organization was made during the Winter meetings of the American Economic Association in Chicago in December 1919.  The ""National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc."" was formally chartered and launched on January 29, 1920.  Edwin F. Gay was to serve as the NBER's first president, and Wesley C. Mitchell was to serve as its first director of research. At its foundation, the NBER charter stated that its objective was ""To encourage, in the broadest and most liberal manner, investigation, research and discovery, and the application of knowledge to the well-being of mankind; and in particular to conduct, or assist in the making of, exact and impartial investigations in the field of economic, social and industrial science, and to this end to cooperate with governments, universities, learned societies and individuals"".  Or as it would would later clarify, """"it seeks not only to find facts and make them known, but to determine them in such manner and under such supervision as to make its findings carry conviction to Liberal and Conservative alike.""  A 19-member Board of Directors was instituted, which included a balanced representation of views and interests.  It included ex officio representatives of the AEA and ASA, as well as six designated universities (Harvard, Yale, Chicago, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania).  It also included representatives of the American Federation of Labor,  the National Bankers' Association, the National Industrial Conference Board,  Federation of Farm Bureaus, National Publishers' Association, Engineering Council, etc.  Plans to include representatives of the Federal Reserve and US departments of Treasury, Commerce and Labor were nixed as it might compromise the political independence of the NBER. (The composition of the board was rearranged in 1927, and increased to 22 directors). Research in 1920s Mitchell's initial research staff consisted of Wilford I. King, Frederick R. Macaulay and Oswald W. Knauth. They completed the founding study on income distribution in the United States within two years. It was published as two volumes in 1921-22.  The study famously presented two independent estimates of national income - one by Knauth involving income tax returns, another by King involving census and other data.  A slimmer volume by Knauth summarizing the 1919 findings by state came out a little later.  It proved a success, and persuaded the directors that the NBER should continue.  With the US reeling from the recession of 1920-21, Mitchell persuaded the NBER directors to take up business cycles as a second project.  This turn was helped when, in 1921, Herbert Hoover (then Harding's Secretary of Commerce) requested the NBER to provide reliable data on cyclical unemployment.  The Carnegie Corporation provided a grant to that end.  Knauth resigned in 1922 to take a job in the private sector (an updated edition of Knauth's income by states was completed by Maurice Leven in 1925).   To complete the Hoover Committee report on time, Leo Wolman and Willard L. Thorp were added to the research staff in 1922 (director T.S. Adams and a dozen other outside contributors also lent a hand to the Hoover study).  A supplement to the Hoover study's unemployment estimates by King came out in 1923.  In 1922, another request came, this time from the National Research Council, who proposed to fund a study on immigration. To undertake that study, Harry Jerome took leave from Wisconsin and joined the NBER staff in 1923.  Jerome's study on migration was published in 1926  Partly to deal with the expanding scope of NBER projects, Edwin F. Gay was appointed joint director of research in 1924.  Mitchell at Columbia and Gay at Harvard would serve as joint directors of research of the NBER  for the next decade.  The process of project approval was formalized shortly after.  Proposals were submitted by the directors of research to the NBER's board of directors for approval, and upon completion, nothing would go out without all the board first reading it, and voting in majority for its publication. With the board's approval, Mitchell began his own analytical treatise on business cycles in 1924, that would would eventually appear in 1927 as Business Cycles: the problem and its setting, while Willard Thorp began collecting the relevant cycle data on seventeen countries as far back to 1890 (some earlier) that would appear as Business Annals in 1926. Tangentially related to cycles, Wolman's monumental history of labor union membership was published in 1924, but a much-announced study of bond yields and interest rates over the cycle by Frederick Macaulay, begun as early as 1923, did not seem to get past the door and would not see the light of day until fifteen years later (1938).   The initial successes of the NBER had led to outside grants coming in to commission studies.  Even before the Jerome migration study was completed,  the NBER was asked by the NRC in 1925 to conduct two further studies on immigration, to be funded by the SSRC - one on the relationship between immigration and mechanization, another on international immigration patterns.  Jerome took up the former, while the venerable William F. Willcox (then at Cornell) agreed to take up the latter.  However, Jerome had to return to his teaching duties at Wisconsin in 1926, and continued only on a part-time basis.  Despite having his hands full, Jerome launched another project estimating hourly productivity, also financed by the SSRC grant.  The SSRC also provided a small grant for Wolman to undertake a study of the US labor market.  Of these new projects, only the first volume of Willcox's study on world migrations appeared before the end of the decade. In 1925, the NBER directors proposed yet another area of research: the structure of prices.  Frederick C. Mills of Columbia joined the NBER staff in 1925 to undertake this, and the resulting study was published in 1927.  Mills promptly began working on his second volume on prices.  In the meantime, with his theoretical treatise nearing completion, Mitchell began to project a second volume on business cycles, to digest Thorp's mass of data.  But Thorp had resigned from full-time at the NBER after completing his annals. To replace him, Mitchell's student Simon Kuznets joined the NBER staff in 1926, to sift through the data, loosely supervised by Thorp from a distance.  Nonetheless, Thorp continued to collect data, and announced in early 1929 his intention to publish a five-volume encyclopaedia of statistical series. Wilford I. King, charged since 1923 with undertaking a detailed study of income distribution, also much announced, also kept getting delayed.  Since Knauth's resignation, King was also responsible for updating income estimates and kept getting pestered to provide data for the periodic NBER Bulletin.  In 1926, King had to interrupt his distribution work to undertake a pilot study on philanthropic organizations on a grant from the Carnegie Corporation.  Exhausted and plagued by ill-health, King resigned from the NBER in 1927 to take up a position at NYU, leaving only the monograph on philanthropy to be published by the NBER in 1928. King's remaining work for the NBER would have to be primarily completed through assistants.   In late 1927, the Hoover Committee hit up the NBER again, requesting a survey of recent changes in the US economy since 1922.  The massive study  involved contributions from NBER staff and authors outside the NBER, supervised by Hoover committee secretary E.E. Hunt.  (Hoover himself resigned the committee half-way through to run for president; A.W. Shaw chaired the committee thereafter).  The study was finally completed in February 1929  and published in two volumes that May.  Wolman, Thorp, Mills and King (via Copeland) offered chapters based on their impending work.  It offered a comprehensive snapshot of the US economy up to the eve of the Great Depression. 1930s 1930 finally saw the publication of W.I. King's study on income, effectively updating the 1921-22 study.The NBER put out a periodic Bulletin until 1940, when it was replaced by the ""Occasional Paper"" series.  Its early crop of researchers included Wilford I. King, F.C. Macalay and Leo Wolman.  NBER stalwarts Frederick C. Mills and Simon Kuznets joined the NBER shortly after, Arthur F.

The Kiel School," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by Kiel Institute of World Economics or any other organization. See the official Kiel Institute website] The ""Kiel School"" refers to the group of German reform economists attached to the Kiel Institute of World Economics during the interwar period. Founded by Bernhard Harms in 1914,  the Kiel Institute was headed by Adolph Lowe from 1926 to 1931. Its research associates included Hans Neisser, Jacob Marschak, Gerhard Colm and Wassily Leontief. The Kiel School was dismantled after Hitler's rise to power and its members dispersed.  Many of its leading members reassembled at the New School for Social Research in New York, where,  recast as the ""Institute of World Affairs"", they tried to carry on their pre-war research program. The research program of the Kiel School can be summarized succinctly as ""structural"" theories of growth and the business cycle.  Succinctly, the ""structural"" approach argues that the source of growth and cycles is the relationship between various sectors in the real economy.  They reached into a long Central European tradition of multi-sectoral models from Marx, Tugan-Baranovsky, Spiethoff,  Aftalion and Fel'dman. In the Kiel School approach, technical progress continuously modifies the real rate of return on capital, thereby causing for sectoral maladjustments, permanent excess capacity and technological unemployment during the process of growth.  The structural theories of   ""disproportional growth"" were taken up by other German economists, notably Emil Lederer,  joined the emigres of the Kiel Institute at the New School for Social Research.   The ""horizontally disaggregated"", i.e. multi-sectoral input-output approach of the Kiel School was imported into American economics by Wassily Leontief (1941), who was himself a researcher at Kiel in the 1920s.  Ragnar Nurkse's work (1934) is also associated with the Kiel approach. The Kiel School's structural growth theory implied policy measures which were different from the conventional ones: ""aggregate"" measures to reduce unemployment, such as lowering wages or stimulating demand, ignored inter-sectoral difficulties, the root cause of the problem, and thus needed to be more precisely directed.  As Lederer noted:  ""The primitive conception that, whenever unemployment exists one could always restore equilibrium by a reduction in wages belongs into the junk-room of theory"" (E. Lederer, 1931: p.32) They argued that the only policy-effective measures would be those that were targeted to clear up sectoral problems and achieve balanced growth. This emphasis on analyzing carefully the economic impact of policy measures and long-term growth targeting was emphasized in the fiscal policy work of Gerhard Colm, perhaps the Kiel School's most successful member. All this, of course, required a good degree of ""micro"" management by the government which implies a good amount of transfer of power to the State -- a prospect which the Kiel School, who suffered at the hands of the Nazis, did not relish.  As such, many members of the Kiel School, notably Adolph Lowe, ventured beyond the confines of economics to other social sciences and humanities, to inform their policy analysis.  Their ultimate vision was an  ""industrial democracy"" where policy would still be ""micro""-oriented, but under democratic control and responding to a well-defined set of welfare criteria.

The Cowles Commission," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the Cowles Foundation or any other organization. See the official Cowles Foundation website]  The ""Cowles Commission for Research in Economics"" was founded by the businessman and economist, Alfred Cowles in 1932. The Cowles Commission initially found its home in Colorado Springs, and its first research director, Charles F. Roos, appointed in 1934.  The Austrian emigre economists Gerhard Tintner and Abraham Wald found their way to Colorado Springs as research fellows. In 1939, the Cowles Commission moved to the University of Chicago under the directorship of Theodore O. Yntema (a student of the recently-deceased Henry Schultz). Jacob Marschak took over as director in 1943 until 1948, when he passed the reins over to Tjalling C. Koopmans.  Rising hostile opposition to the Cowles Commission by the department of economics at Chicago during the 1950s  led Koopmans to convince the Cowles family to move it to Yale University in 1955 (where it was renamed the ""Cowles Foundation""). As its motto (Science is Measurement, later adjusted to Theory and Measurement) indicates, the Cowles Commission was dedicated to the pursuit of linking economic theory to mathematics and statistics. Its main contributions to economics lie in its ""creation"" and consolidation of two important fields -- general equilibrium theory and econometrics - which were vigorously pursued by its two most famous directors: Jacob Marschak (director from 1943 to 1948) and Tjalling C. Koopmans (director from 1948 to 1954).  James Tobin would become director after the 1955 move to Yale.  From 1955 to 1967, the directorship became a veritable musical chair between Tobin and Koopmans. The Cowles Commission benefited greatly from the great European intellectual migration of the 1930s and 1940s: many economists, statisticians and mathematicians from Central Europe and elsewhere poured into the United States. Many of these, such as those of the Vienna Colloquium were familiar with Walrasian theory and thus the Cowles Commission was an important haven for many of them. General Equilibrium Theory The list of economists who passed through Cowles on the way to establishing Walrasian G.E. Theory is rather large. Theodore O. Yntema, Oskar Lange and Jacob Mosak were early Cowles Commission associates that began working immediately on G.E. systems. The 1944 Cowles monographs on Price Flexibility and Employment by Oskar Lange and General Equilibrium Theory in International Trade by Jacob Mosak are classics of G.E. theory. From its inception, the Cowles Commission had set down links across the Atlantic: early Cowles participants included Ragnar Frisch, Rene Roy and the L.S.E. economists, R.G.D.Allen and Abba Lerner. They were joined in the 1940s by more foreigners interested in G.E., such as Leonid Hurwicz, Jacob Marschak and Tjalling Koopmans. Several young Americans of mathematical persuasion, such as Kenneth Arrow, I.N. Herstein and Herbert Simon, signed up soon after. From France, Gerard Debreu and Edmond Malinvaud, two students of Maurice Allais, joined quickly after. Lionel McKenzie, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and David Gale were also familiar faces at Cowles. The initial concern was the development of activity analysis and linear programming - initiated by the 1937 von Neumann paper and the works of Abraham Wald, both members of the old Vienna Colloquium -- to describe the production side and later the demand side of the economy. The famous 1951 Cowles conference and monograph, Activity Analysis of Production and Allocation edited by Koopmans provides a historic collection of breakthrough papers on this topic. The year 1951 also saw another path-breaking contribution appear as a Cowles monograph, namely Social Choice and Individual Values by Kenneth Arrow, which introduced the famous ""Arrow (Im)possibility Theorem"" and initiated the axiomatic development of Social Choice theory. The early post-war period attracted numerous young economists: Roy Radner, Martin J. Beckmann, Don Patinkin, Franco Modigliani, Stanley Reiter, Harry Markowitz, Hendrik Houthakker,  Helen Makower which were instrumental to the development of general equilibrium theory and its applications to other fields. The year 1959 saw the publication of two more historical Cowles monographs: Gerard Debreu's classic Theory of Value: An axiomatic approach and Harry Markowitz's Portfolio Selection. After the move to Yale in 1955, several more economists and mathematicians became involved in the Cowles project: James Tobin, Herbert Scarf, Martin Shubik, Donald J. Brown, Abraham Robinson, Edmund Phelps, Joseph Stiglitz, Menahem Yaari, Ross M. Starr, William Nordhaus and numerous others. The issue of choice under uncertainty and information was pursued in the 1967 series of monographs by Donald Hester and James Tobin. In 1972, the famous monograph Economic Theory of Teams of Jacob Marschak and Roy Radner appeared, and, in 1973, the Computation of Economic Equilibria by Herbert Scarf. Econometrics: The Cowles Commission approach to econometrics is famous for its concentration on the estimation of large, simultaneous equations models - particularly the economy-scale macroeconometric models enabled by the Keynesian Revolution in economics. The ""identification problem"" was a very early and famous concern of the Cowles Commission as were the methods of estimation and hypothesis testing used today in economics. The Cowles program on econometrics was pioneered in the 1930s and 1940s by Ragnar Frisch, Gerhard Tintner, Trygve Haavelmo, Lawrence Klein and, for a while, Abraham Wald. Other Cowles figures such as Jacob Marschak, T.C. Koopmans, Leonid Hurwicz, Edmond Malinvaud, Theodore W. Anderson, Carl Christ and Herman Rubin were also instrumental figures. Among the famous outputs of the Cowles work was the ""Klein Model"", an essentially multi-sectoral Neo-Keynesian behemoth of an econometric model. After a long pause since 1955, multi-equation econometrics at Cowles picked up again in the 1980s with the work of Ray C. Fair. There are two Cowles monographs on econometrics which deserve special mention, both of which came out in 1950: the Koopmans-edited Statistical Inference in Dynamic Economic Models, the proceedings of a conference which set up econometrics as we know it, and Lawrence Klein's Economic Fluctuations in the United States, 1921-1941, which introduced the world to the Klein Model. Cowles Nobels: Several Cowles associates have won Nobel prizes for research done while at the Cowles Commission. These include Tjalling Koopmans, Kenneth Arrow, Gerard Debreu, James Tobin, Franco Modigliani, Herbert Simon, Lawrence Klein, Trygve Haavelmo and Harry Markowitz.

The Nobel Memorial Prize," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by the Nobel Foundation, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences or any other organization. See the official Nobel Memorial Prize website]  In 1896, Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite, bequeathed his fortune to a foundation to create an annual prize for person ""who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.""   Nobel's will specified prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology/medicine, literature and peace.  These were first awarded in 1901. In 1969, the Swedish central bank (Sveriges Riksbank) established a prize known as the ""Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel"", which is commonly shortened to the Nobel Memorial Prize.   The Nobel Memorial Prize has a similar procedure of award selection (by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences) as the original Nobel prizes.  It also disburses the same monetary amounts and shares in the formal ceremony. The Nobel Memorial Prize has been quite controversial since its inception and numerous objections have been raised against it.  The first objection is, of course, that its name causes confusion with the original Nobel prizes created by Alfred Nobel. The usual implication is that economics is either not ""scientific"" enough or does not contribute to ""human advancement"" enough to merit the prestige of an award with the Nobel name.  The sentiment, often echoed in wider intellectual circles and the popular press, is shared by many economists themselves.  Indeed, Gunnar Myrdal, after having helped the Riksbank set it up in 1968 and receiving the award himself in 1974, eventually came to publicly regret this.   The second objection, is that the Bank of Sweden's decision to use the prestigious ""Nobel"" name catapulted that specific prize to an undue degree of prominence over other honors, such as the AEA Walker's Medal or the Econometric Society's fellowships. Moreover, it has been accused of thrusting economics into a kind of medal race, pitting nations, universities and individual economists against each other.  All this leads to a lot of unnecessary acrimony that distracts and disrupts serious economics research.  A third objection, and one that has become increasingly louder, is that there is an insufficient number of truly outstanding economists that deserve it.  After the initial splash of glorious names in the 1970s and early 1980s, many have come to argue that the awards made since the 1990s are more disputable.    This is true to some extent, but also understandable. When the awards began being handed out from 1969 onwards, there were generations upon generations of deserving scholars which had to be quickly awarded before it was too late.  The choices of the 1970s were not really disputed.  By sheer bad luck, giants such as Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor, Abba Lerner and Don Patinkin never won the award partly because they were unfortunate enough to die too soon.   By the mid-1980s, with the ""doubtless"" Nobel laureates either already rewarded or dead, it was natural for the awards committee to begin pacing itself somewhat and start scooping gems from a little bit below the cream.   A fourth objection is that the Nobel awards committee has its own agenda and doles out the awards with an eye to encourage the profession to move in a particular direction.   At the crudest level, some have claimed that it has  a ""Chicago School"" bias, given the number of economists associated with the University of Chicago that have won the awards (for a breakdown of the awards by nationality and school, click here).   This is not wholly untrue, but it ought to be placed in context. The Nobel name, of course, lends a powerful platform to the recipients -- and the awards committee has made controversial and idiosyncratic choices which have had a profound impact on the economics profession.  The 1974 award to the nearly-obscure Friedrich A. Hayek, for instance, generated a huge resurgence of interest in Hayek and Austrian economics.  Milton Friedman's 1976 award elevated him overnight from the profession's maverick to one of its elder statesmen and gave Monetarism a more respectable polish.  In more recent years, awards have brought entire fields of study into the research spotlight: bounded rationality was virtually unknown before Herbert Simon's 1978 award; so was Public Choice theory until James Buchanan's 1986 award.   New Institutionalism and New Economic History were still fringe movements before the awards to Coase, Becker, Fogel and North in 1991-1993. Of course, at times, the suggestions of the Nobel committee do not seem to have the desired impact.  The awards to Kuznets and Stone, for instance, were perhaps meant to encourage the vital but unglamorous tasks of data compilation and interpretation, but there was no perceptible rise in interest in their aftermath.  A corollary to this is that the Bank of Sweden is occasionally criticized is for failing to choose the most popular candidates.  Some of the choices it has made have been openly criticized by professional economists.  There are a number of perennial candidates so universally liked and recommended, always leading straw polls year after year, whom nonetheless received no award.   However, it is precisely because of the erratic and disproportionate ""impact"" the Bank of Sweden's choice has upon the profession and the shape of subsequent economics research that many  have called for an end to the Nobel Memorial Prize. One proposition is to replace it with a less lop-sided and less pretentious ""lifetime award"", like the Francis Walker Medal that used to be handed out by the American Economic Association. The Bank of Sweden's Nobel Memorial prize for economics is announced around October 12th of every year, while the actual ceremony (shared with the original Nobel awards) is on December 8th.  Winners are requested to present a ""Nobel Memorial Lectures"", which is initially published in the volume Les Prix Nobel en xxxx, put out every year by the Nobel Foundation and then republished later in the academic journals of their laureate's choice.  In recent years, the American Economic Review has intermittently reprinted many of the Nobel Memorial Lectures.

Journals are ordered chronologically from date of first issue.  Acronyms and nicknames we use in this website are given under journal titles.  (Click here for alphabetical list of journal acronyms) Pre-Enlightenment (pre-1750) The means of communication of economic ideas have, of course, varied over the centuries.  Medieval scholastic writers expressed their economic theories mostly in religious treatises on law and justice (De justitie et jure).  In the 17th and 18th Centuries, Mercantilists and other economic writers published their work (usually anonymously) as pamphlets of persuastion, usually addressed to rulers and parliaments, in the hope of influencing policy.  Some (e.g. Cameralists) were already state officials, and publishing handbooks for their successors.  Throughout this time, only a handful of regularly-published journals existed.  These were set up largely to review scientific literature that was published elsewhere rather than as a repository for new essay-length treatises.  The two leading serious journals in Europe were the French Journal des Savants and the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.  In the 1690s we begin seeing the first commercial newspapers, put out as reading materials for the merchant customers of London coffee houses.  In the early 1700s starts the great explosion of Augustan literary reviews, - DeFoe's Review, Swift's Examiner, and Steele & Addison's Spectator, usually written singlehandedly. While dedicated to politics, satire and scandal, they could occasionally turn to economic and financial matters.  Journal des Savants (France, 1665-)# Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (Britain, 1665-)#  Nouvelles de la r√©publique des lettres (France, 1685-1710)# Lloyd's List and Shipping Gazette, (Britain, 1696-) The Course of the Exchange, and Other Things (1698-) A Review of the Affairs of France: and of all Europe, as influence'd by that nation (1704-1712)#* The Tatler (Britain, 1709-1711)#* The Examiner (Britain, 1710-1714)#* The Spectator (Britain, 1711-1714)#* Enlightenment Journals (c. 1750-1800) Around the mid-18th Century, gripped by the Enlightenment spirit, a new means of communication emerged, the learned journal or review.  The demand during this period was clear: the middle classes were looking for ""self-improvement"", the educated classes looking for exciting debates and new ideas, and for the nobility looking for topics for social conversation (perfect for poseurs!).   The success of  Denis Diderot's Encyclop√®die, published between 1751 and 1765, was the great spur for the development of journals.  True, the public had always demanded magazines -- weekly or monthly publications dedicated to witty, political position papers, current news or contemporary dramatic and literary criticism, like the early 18th century light magazines Mercure de France or the Tatler and Spectator.  But what the Encyclop√®die specifically taught was that the public was willing to digest high-level theoretical essays -- bound together, published regularly over time and distributed as fascicules to subscribers. In short, journals.   It seems as if encyclopedias, and not magazines, are the true antecedents of the modern scholarly journal. There was an explosion of high-quality learned journals in the 1750s and 1760s, particularly in France.  Several of them were exclusively dedicated to serious treatises on political economy.   The following were the leading journals of the period where economic writers were welcome:  Scots Magazine (Britain, 1739-1826)# Encyclop√®die, ou Dictionnaire raisonn√© des sciences, des m√©tiers et des arts. (France, 1751-1765)# Journal oeconomique (France, 1751-1772) Novelliste Oeconomique et Litt√©raire (France, 1754-1761) Edinburgh Review (Britain, 1755-1756)# Journal du Commerce (Belgium, 1759-1762) Gazette du Commerce (France, 1763-1783)* Journal d'agriculture, du commerce et des finances (France, 1765-1783) Eph√©m√©rides du Citoyen (France, 1765-1772) Nouvelles Eph√©m√©rides Economiques (France, 1774-1766, 1788?). Ephemeriden der Menschheit (Germany, 1776-1782) Treatises and Reviews  (c.1800-1850) Then something happened.  We are not quite sure what,  but it seems as if, by at least the early 1790s, many of the learned journals  disappeared.  Doubtlessly, some were closed down by the nervousness of kings and clergy.  Perhaps this was reinforced by the passing of the Enlightenment's penchant for self-improvement and the subsequent exigencies of revolution and war.  What seems certain is that the means of economic communication entered a new phase.  Economic essays continued to be written, but without specialized journals, distribution was a problem.  For the most part, essay-length treatises were turned either into policy pamphlets, or entries into encyclopedias (and numerous ones were intermittently cobbled together) or were snuck into the (few) existing journals of other scientific fields (statistical journals were a particular favorite).  Alternatively, they could write a book.  It was around this time that the first book-length (and, more interestingly, signed) treatises in economics began to appear.  The first were probably those of Sir James Steuart (1767) and Adam Smith (1776).   Virtually every economist of the time -- such as Say, Ricardo and Malthus --  eventually attempted their hand at a comprehensive, book-length  ""treatise"".  While excellent in offering the author free reign in abstract theorizing, the book-length treatise was not always a good means of transmitting new ideas and generating scholarly debate.  Often written as textbooks (to convince publishers of sales value), readers would have to dig through two hundred or so pages of elementary, well-known basic principles and mountains of definitions and illustrative examples, before finally reaching the theoretical ""meat"".   This was also the time of the great British ""reviews"" - the Whiggish Edinburgh Review (f.1802), the staunchly Tory Quarterly Review (1809), Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine (1817), the Benthamite Westminster Review (1824), etc.  But these reviews were a throwback to the pre-Enlightenment formula - that is, geared to reviewing existing pamphlets and treatises, rather than a medium for original essays.  To be sure, the reviewers inserted their own perspectives in the reviews, but there wasn't space for the kind of abstract, focused theoretical treatment you would have found in the Enlightenment journals.  Of the four, the Edinburgh Review probably commands pride of place of retaining a high equality focus on economics from its inception until at least the 1840s.  The others were more news-oriented, general-topic magazines. Finally, we should make mention of the production of small volumes for popular consumption - like  Jane Marcet (1816) and Harriet Martineau (1834).  These outlined economic principles for general ""low-brow"" consumption.  One should also take note of  the emergence of magazines such as the weekly The Economist and the monthly Journal des √©conomistes. Lighter and more journalistic than the reviews, these magazines were at least a bit more focused on issues related to political economy.  Naturally, there was even less room for abstract theoretical essays in these magazines, but they were important channels by which economists could influence the general public opinion on economic policies and issues of the day.   The following is a selection of the the major periodicals of this era: La D√©cade philosophique (France, 1794-?) Journal des d√©bats (1789-1842)*# Journal d'√©conomie publique, de morale et de politique (France, 1796-?)* Annales de statistique, ou Journal d'√©conomie politique, industrielle et commerciale, de g√©ographie, d'histoire naturelle, d'agriculture, de physique, d'hygi√®ne et de litt√©rature (France, 1801-?)# Edinburgh Review (Britain, 1802-1929)#   Quarterly Review (Britain 1809-1967)# Le Censeur, (France 1814-15)#   Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine (Britain, 1817-1980)*# Le Censeur Europ√©en ou Examen de diverses questions de droit public et de divers, (France 1818)#   Revue Encyclop√©dique (France, 1819-1835)# Westminster Review (Britain, 1824-1914)# The Spectator (Britain, 1828-)*# Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country (Britain, 1830-)*# Proceedings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (Britain, 1833-) Journal of the (Royal) Statistical Society of London  (Britain, 1838-)# Bulletin of Manchester Statistical Society (Britain, 1833-)# Journal des √©conomistes (France, 1841-1940)* New York Daily Tribune (U.S., 1841-1924) Punch Magazine (Britain, 1841-)*# Rheinische Zeitung f√ºr Politik, Handel und Gewerbe (Germany, 1842-1843) The Economist (Britain, 1843-)* New Englander and Yale Review (U.S., 1843-1892)*# Libre-√âchange (France, 1846-?)* Neue Rheinische Zeitung: Organ f√ºr demokratie (Germany, 1848-1849) Emergence of Academic Economics Journals (c.1850-c.1915) The specialized, scholarly journals we are familiar with today emerged around mid-century in Central Europe.  The serious research traditions and early academic professionalization in Continental European universities required a serious outlet -- and this generated the resurrection of the scholarly journal.   The Anglo-American universities, which still seemed like  ""young gentlemen finishing schools"" during much of this period , caught up much more slowly.  However, nearing the turn of the century, there emerged a series of ""new"" research universities along Continental lines, such as Johns Hopkins, Chicago, M.I.T. and the  L.S.E..  The research needs and the competitive spirit of these fledgling institutions encouraged the exploration of various avenues by which to make their institutional mark on the academic landscape.  At every step, their efforts were copied by the older universities such as Cambridge, Harvard and Yale who were eager not to be left behind and, in the process, reinvented themselves as research schools.  Creating professional associations and launching journals was a quick way of raising the profile of a university and stamping it as a ""serious"" research institution.  Hosting a journal is always good way to attract attention, but what is even better is that by controlling the editorship of the house journal, the universities simultaneously ensured that their own faculty's publication lists will climb a lot faster than those of others.   The incentive to establish journals in economics was even greater than for other fields: recall that the status of economics as a serious, ""scientific"" subject was in grave doubt in the 1860s and 1870s, thus anything that could be done to ""legitimize"" it professionally was encouraged.  Thus, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, the American Economic Association, the Royal Economic Society, the Journal of Political Economy, etc. were all clear attempts by  professional academic economists to not only raise the profiles of their universities on a national scale, but also that of their departments within the university. Also worth mentioning was the rise of the left-wing economics magazine during this period.  As labor movements, cooperatives and more radical socialist movements emerged, they found themselves uniformly opposed by the conventional reviews and magazines.  They thus created their own -- not only to influence wider public opinion, but also to raise the political and economic consciousness of the working classes they claimed to represent.  Most of these did not last long -- usually for lack of funds and/or political suppression. But a handful of ones -- particular those associated with established parties (e.g.  Labour in Britain) -- managed to survive into the next era. The following economics periodicals were begun in this period: Zeitschrift f√ºr die gesamte staatswissenschaft (Germany, 1844-) Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© d'√©conomie politique (France,1846-) De Economist ((Netherlands, 1852-)  The Atlantic Monthly (U.S., 1857-)*# Macmillan's Magazine (Britain, 1859-?)  Founded by David Masson, a literature professor at Edinburgh.  In the 1880s, it snatched Morley from the Fortnightly Review, who brought along some economists for a a few yours. Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr national√∂konomie und statistik (German, 1863-) Fortnightly Review (Britain, 1865-1954 )*# Contemporary Review (Britain, 1866- )*# Jahrbuch f√ºr Verwaltung und Rechtspflege des Deutschen Reichs (Germany, 1871-) L'√âconomiste fran√ßais (1873 -1937)* Giornale degli Economisti (Italy, 1875-) Mind (Britain, 1876-)# Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (U.S., 1877-)# La r√©forme sociale, (France, 1881-1930) Die Neue Zeit: Revue des geistigen und √∂ffentlichen Lebens (Germany, 1883-1923) Annuaire de l'√©conomie politique et de la statistique (France, 1884-1899) The Commonweal (Britain, 1885-1895)*# Quarterly Journal of Economics (U.S., 1886-)  Political Science Quarterly (U.S., 1886-) Revue d'√©conomie politique (France, 1887-) Stats√∏konomisk tidsskrift (Norway, 1887-) Journal of American Statistical Association (U.S.,1888-) Economic Journal (Britain, 1891-) Economic Review (Britain, 1891-1914) Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Sciences (U.S., 1890-)# The Clarion  (Britain, 1891-1931)*# Journal of Political Economy (U.S., 1892-) Yale Review (U.S., 1892-1911?)

Biometrika (Britain, 1901-)# Revue √©conomique internationale (Belgium, 1904-1940) Proceedings of the American Political Science Association (U.S., 1904-, then American Political Science Review, 1913-)# The Nation  (Britain, 1907-1931)*# Revue d'histoire √©conomique et sociale (France, 1908-) Bulletin of the American Economic Association (U.S., 1908-1910) American Economic Review (U.S., 1911-) Archiv fur Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik (Germany, 1911-1923) The New Statesman (Britain, 1912-)*# The International Institutional Wave (c. 1915-c.1970) The experience of the previous period demonstrated that a journal was a particularly effective way of advertising an institution like a university or a professional association.  After World War I, numerous ""new"" institutions hungry for attention absorbed the lesson and put out a journal.  Many of these institutions included attention-hungry universities like L.S.E, Manchester, Osaka, Oxford, Louvain, the New School, etc.  New research institutes, like Kiel Institute and the Institut de Sciences Economiques Applique√©s, did the same.  In a peculiar twist, entire countries (e.g. Australia, South Africa, Canada,  Scotland, etc.) brought out journals as flag-carriers, symbols of national research prestige.  Even commercial banks and companies, such as Lloyds and Banca Nazionale de Lavoro introduced house journals. A second kind of journal emerged in this period -- namely, those created in response to the restrictive editorial policies of the older journals.  Particularly important were Econometrica and the Review of Economic Studies created by economists frustrated at the anti-mathematical bent of the existing journals.  Similarly, Metroeconomica and the Journal of Economic Issues, were created in response to the refusal of older journals to consider articles which were not written in accordance with the dominant Anglo-American economic orthodoxy of the day.   The following journals were created during this period (many institutionally-backed journals are generalist, so we don't give details for all). Weltwirtschaftliches Archiv (Germany, 1913-)  Chinese Social and Political Science Review (China, 1916-1937) Review of Economics and Statistics  (U.S., 1919-) Economica (Britain, 1921-) International Labour Review (International, 1921-) Zeitschrift f√ºr Volkswirtschaft und Socialpolitik (Austria, 1921-1927) Journal of Business (U.S., 1922-) Annali di economia (Italy, 1924-) Economic Record (Australia, 1924-) Kyoto University Economic Review (Japan, 1926-?)

Although they relieved a good amount of backlog that had been accumulating, they were not specialist journals.  But academic economists are specialized people.  That means that the average subscriber to, say, the Bohemian Journal of Economics would have to consider himself extraordinarily lucky to find one or two articles of interest in every journal issue he received.  A specialized journal would be nice, they thought, but which institution is to provide it?  The easiest way was to form haphazard ""societies"" in a specialized academic subject and then hire a commercial publishing house to publish the ""society's"" journal.  Sometimes, one can dispense with the society altogether.  It was in some version of this that specialized journals -- such as the Journal of Economic Theory, the Journal of Public Economics, the Journal of Monetary Economics, etc. -- emerged.   Many of these were highly successful, climbing quickly in prestige over the older institution-backed journals. The need was certainly there for many of them.  But by the late 1980s, and certainly the mid-1990s, many people argue that things have gone perhaps a bit overboard (not only in economics, but in many other fields as well).   The big commercial publishing houses (you know who they are!) caught on to the game quickly enough.  Whatever journal they put out, there is always a demand (i.e. at worst, there are the university libraries who are generally ""forced"" to buy them).  Similarly, there is always a supply (economists, pressed by ""publish-or-perish"", always have articles).  And finding an editor is always easy (editorship of a journal brings professional prestige to an individual in the academic rat race -- a slight variation on the institutional prestige theme we talked about earlier).  So, in recent years, the publishing houses have been pushing journals like there was no tomorrow:  every topic and sub-topic and sub-sub-topic has its own journal today.   It is easy to see why this has gone too far: most are unaffordable to individuals (exorbitant prices are set to gouge libraries), quality per issue has declined (the few good articles in a field end up being spread too thin among the many competing journals) and, some claim, the situation has degenerated to the point where the publishing houses will gleefully put out ""personal boutique"" journals -- where little beyond the editor's own vanity or bid for self-promotion justifies its existence.  Currently, economics is the discipline with the largest number of new journals every year. Specialization, of course, breeds blinders -- so demand for a second type of journal -- the ""survey"" journal -- emerged in this period.  These journals collect and publish comprehensive and easy-to-understand surveys of the state of the art in various topics and fields.  Such surveys used to be occasionally published by the conventional journals such as Econometrica, as a way for specialists in other fields to have an idea what was going on somewhere else.   However, the degree of specialization in economics is such that more surveys are necessary, and ever more often, and ever simpler. There are now a handful of journals, such as the Journal of Economic Literature and the Journal of Economic Perspectives, dedicated exclusively to surveys.  [It has been speculated that the old general-purpose conventional journals might eventually be done in by this trend: economists today are happy enough to concentrate all their journal-reading on their own specialized sub-sub-field journal plus one or two general survey journals.] A third type of journal emerged in this period: the heterodox journal, such as the Review of Radical Political Economy, the Journal of Post Keynesian Economics, the Cambridge Journal of Economics, etc. These were established as non-mainstream economists were increasingly finding themselves blocked out of the existing journals.   Consequently, they organized themselves and formed journals dedicated to their own school-of-thought -- not unlike the mathematical economists did with Econometrica and RES in the early 1930s.  However, we should emphasize that the heterodox journal arose not out of a bid by a school of thought for institutional legitimacy. Indeed, some claim that quite the reverse happened: the worst thing for a heterodox school of thought to do is to ""ghettoize"" itself out of the mainstream with a journal (there is an exception to this rule: the early prestige of the JPE ensured that the Chicago School could ghettoize itself without appearing to actually do so).  Rather,  the emergence of the heterodox journal was an indicator of how bad things really got in terms of editorial decisions of the conventional journals. The following journals were established in this period.  We cannot hope to list all the publishing house journals here so the list just captures a few of the (more legitimate) earlier ones.  As most have self-explanatory titles, we do not bother to give details.

(Click here for alphabetical list of journal acronyms) Pre-Enlightenment (pre-1750) The means of communication of economic ideas have, of course, varied over the centuries.  Medieval scholastic writers expressed their economic theories mostly in religious treatises on law and justice (De justitie et jure).  In the 17th and 18th Centuries, Mercantilists and other economic writers published their work (usually anonymously) as pamphlets of persuastion, usually addressed to rulers and parliaments, in the hope of influencing policy.  Some (e.g. Cameralists) were already state officials, and publishing handbooks for their successors.  Throughout this time, only a handful of regularly-published journals existed.  These were set up largely to review scientific literature that was published elsewhere rather than as a repository for new essay-length treatises.  The two leading serious journals in Europe were the French Journal des Savants and the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.  In the 1690s we begin seeing the first commercial newspapers, put out as reading materials for the merchant customers of London coffee houses.  In the early 1700s starts the great explosion of Augustan literary reviews, - DeFoe's Review, Swift's Examiner, and Steele & Addison's Spectator, usually written singlehandedly. While dedicated to politics, satire and scandal, they could occasionally turn to economic and financial matters.  Journal des Savants (France, 1665-)# Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (Britain, 1665-)#  Nouvelles de la r√©publique des lettres (France, 1685-1710)# Lloyd's List and Shipping Gazette, (Britain, 1696-) The Course of the Exchange, and Other Things (1698-) A Review of the Affairs of France: and of all Europe, as influence'd by that nation (1704-1712)#* The Tatler (Britain, 1709-1711)#* The Examiner (Britain, 1710-1714)#* The Spectator (Britain, 1711-1714)#* Enlightenment Journals (c. 1750-1800) Around the mid-18th Century, gripped by the Enlightenment spirit, a new means of communication emerged, the learned journal or review.  The demand during this period was clear: the middle classes were looking for ""self-improvement"", the educated classes looking for exciting debates and new ideas, and for the nobility looking for topics for social conversation (perfect for poseurs!).   The success of  Denis Diderot's Encyclop√®die, published between 1751 and 1765, was the great spur for the development of journals.  True, the public had always demanded magazines -- weekly or monthly publications dedicated to witty, political position papers, current news or contemporary dramatic and literary criticism, like the early 18th century light magazines Mercure de France or the Tatler and Spectator.  But what the Encyclop√®die specifically taught was that the public was willing to digest high-level theoretical essays -- bound together, published regularly over time and distributed as fascicules to subscribers. In short, journals.   It seems as if encyclopedias, and not magazines, are the true antecedents of the modern scholarly journal. There was an explosion of high-quality learned journals in the 1750s and 1760s, particularly in France.  Several of them were exclusively dedicated to serious treatises on political economy.   The following were the leading journals of the period where economic writers were welcome:  Scots Magazine (Britain, 1739-1826)# Encyclop√®die, ou Dictionnaire raisonn√© des sciences, des m√©tiers et des arts. (France, 1751-1765)# Journal oeconomique (France, 1751-1772) Novelliste Oeconomique et Litt√©raire (France, 1754-1761) Edinburgh Review (Britain, 1755-1756)# Journal du Commerce (Belgium, 1759-1762) Gazette du Commerce (France, 1763-1783)* Journal d'agriculture, du commerce et des finances (France, 1765-1783) Eph√©m√©rides du Citoyen (France, 1765-1772) Nouvelles Eph√©m√©rides Economiques (France, 1774-1766, 1788?). Ephemeriden der Menschheit (Germany, 1776-1782) Treatises and Reviews  (c.1800-1850) Then something happened.  We are not quite sure what,  but it seems as if, by at least the early 1790s, many of the learned journals  disappeared.  Doubtlessly, some were closed down by the nervousness of kings and clergy.  Perhaps this was reinforced by the passing of the Enlightenment's penchant for self-improvement and the subsequent exigencies of revolution and war.  What seems certain is that the means of economic communication entered a new phase.  Economic essays continued to be written, but without specialized journals, distribution was a problem.  For the most part, essay-length treatises were turned either into policy pamphlets, or entries into encyclopedias (and numerous ones were intermittently cobbled together) or were snuck into the (few) existing journals of other scientific fields (statistical journals were a particular favorite).

Virtually every economist of the time -- such as Say, Ricardo and Malthus --  eventually attempted their hand at a comprehensive, book-length  ""treatise"".  While excellent in offering the author free reign in abstract theorizing, the book-length treatise was not always a good means of transmitting new ideas and generating scholarly debate.  Often written as textbooks (to convince publishers of sales value), readers would have to dig through two hundred or so pages of elementary, well-known basic principles and mountains of definitions and illustrative examples, before finally reaching the theoretical ""meat"".   This was also the time of the great British ""reviews"" - the Whiggish Edinburgh Review (f.1802), the staunchly Tory Quarterly Review (1809), Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine (1817), the Benthamite Westminster Review (1824), etc.  But these reviews were a throwback to the pre-Enlightenment formula - that is, geared to reviewing existing pamphlets and treatises, rather than a medium for original essays.

The following is a selection of the the major periodicals of this era: La D√©cade philosophique (France, 1794-?) Journal des d√©bats (1789-1842)*# Journal d'√©conomie publique, de morale et de politique (France, 1796-?)* Annales de statistique, ou Journal d'√©conomie politique, industrielle et commerciale, de g√©ographie, d'histoire naturelle, d'agriculture, de physique, d'hygi√®ne et de litt√©rature (France, 1801-?)# Edinburgh Review (Britain, 1802-1929)#   Quarterly Review (Britain 1809-1967)# Le Censeur, (France 1814-15)#   Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine (Britain, 1817-1980)*# Le Censeur Europ√©en ou Examen de diverses questions de droit public et de divers, (France 1818)#   Revue Encyclop√©dique (France, 1819-1835)# Westminster Review (Britain, 1824-1914)# The Spectator (Britain, 1828-)*# Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country (Britain, 1830-)*# Proceedings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (Britain, 1833-) Journal of the (Royal) Statistical Society of London  (Britain, 1838-)# Bulletin of Manchester Statistical Society (Britain, 1833-)# Journal des √©conomistes (France, 1841-1940)* New York Daily Tribune (U.S., 1841-1924) Punch Magazine (Britain, 1841-)*# Rheinische Zeitung f√ºr Politik, Handel und Gewerbe (Germany, 1842-1843) The Economist (Britain, 1843-)* New Englander and Yale Review (U.S., 1843-1892)*# Libre-√âchange (France, 1846-?)* Neue Rheinische Zeitung: Organ f√ºr demokratie (Germany, 1848-1849) Emergence of Academic Economics Journals (c.1850-c.1915) The specialized, scholarly journals we are familiar with today emerged around mid-century in Central Europe.  The serious research traditions and early academic professionalization in Continental European universities required a serious outlet -- and this generated the resurrection of the scholarly journal.   The Anglo-American universities, which still seemed like  ""young gentlemen finishing schools"" during much of this period , caught up much more slowly.  However, nearing the turn of the century, there emerged a series of ""new"" research universities along Continental lines, such as Johns Hopkins, Chicago, M.I.T. and the  L.S.E..  The research needs and the competitive spirit of these fledgling institutions encouraged the exploration of various avenues by which to make their institutional mark on the academic landscape.  At every step, their efforts were copied by the older universities such as Cambridge, Harvard and Yale who were eager not to be left behind and, in the process, reinvented themselves as research schools.  Creating professional associations and launching journals was a quick way of raising the profile of a university and stamping it as a ""serious"" research institution.  Hosting a journal is always good way to attract attention, but what is even better is that by controlling the editorship of the house journal, the universities simultaneously ensured that their own faculty's publication lists will climb a lot faster than those of others.   The incentive to establish journals in economics was even greater than for other fields: recall that the status of economics as a serious, ""scientific"" subject was in grave doubt in the 1860s and 1870s, thus anything that could be done to ""legitimize"" it professionally was encouraged.  Thus, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, the American Economic Association, the Royal Economic Society, the Journal of Political Economy, etc. were all clear attempts by  professional academic economists to not only raise the profiles of their universities on a national scale, but also that of their departments within the university. Also worth mentioning was the rise of the left-wing economics magazine during this period.  As labor movements, cooperatives and more radical socialist movements emerged, they found themselves uniformly opposed by the conventional reviews and magazines.  They thus created their own -- not only to influence wider public opinion, but also to raise the political and economic consciousness of the working classes they claimed to represent.  Most of these did not last long -- usually for lack of funds and/or political suppression. But a handful of ones -- particular those associated with established parties (e.g.  Labour in Britain) -- managed to survive into the next era. The following economics periodicals were begun in this period: Zeitschrift f√ºr die gesamte staatswissenschaft (Germany, 1844-) Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© d'√©conomie politique (France,1846-) De Economist ((Netherlands, 1852-)  The Atlantic Monthly (U.S., 1857-)*# Macmillan's Magazine (Britain, 1859-?)  Founded by David Masson, a literature professor at Edinburgh.  In the 1880s, it snatched Morley from the Fortnightly Review, who brought along some economists for a a few yours. Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr national√∂konomie und statistik (German, 1863-) Fortnightly Review (Britain, 1865-1954 )*# Contemporary Review (Britain, 1866- )*# Jahrbuch f√ºr Verwaltung und Rechtspflege des Deutschen Reichs (Germany, 1871-) L'√âconomiste fran√ßais (1873 -1937)* Giornale degli Economisti (Italy, 1875-) Mind (Britain, 1876-)# Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (U.S., 1877-)# La r√©forme sociale, (France, 1881-1930) Die Neue Zeit: Revue des geistigen und √∂ffentlichen Lebens (Germany, 1883-1923) Annuaire de l'√©conomie politique et de la statistique (France, 1884-1899) The Commonweal (Britain, 1885-1895)*# Quarterly Journal of Economics (U.S., 1886-)  Political Science Quarterly (U.S., 1886-) Revue d'√©conomie politique (France, 1887-) Stats√∏konomisk tidsskrift (Norway, 1887-) Journal of American Statistical Association (U.S.,1888-) Economic Journal (Britain, 1891-) Economic Review (Britain, 1891-1914) Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Sciences (U.S., 1890-)# The Clarion  (Britain, 1891-1931)*# Journal of Political Economy (U.S., 1892-) Yale Review (U.S., 1892-1911?)

After World War I, numerous ""new"" institutions hungry for attention absorbed the lesson and put out a journal.  Many of these institutions included attention-hungry universities like L.S.E, Manchester, Osaka, Oxford, Louvain, the New School, etc.  New research institutes, like Kiel Institute and the Institut de Sciences Economiques Applique√©s, did the same.  In a peculiar twist, entire countries (e.g. Australia, South Africa, Canada,  Scotland, etc.) brought out journals as flag-carriers, symbols of national research prestige.  Even commercial banks and companies, such as Lloyds and Banca Nazionale de Lavoro introduced house journals. A second kind of journal emerged in this period -- namely, those created in response to the restrictive editorial policies of the older journals.  Particularly important were Econometrica and the Review of Economic Studies created by economists frustrated at the anti-mathematical bent of the existing journals.  Similarly, Metroeconomica and the Journal of Economic Issues, were created in response to the refusal of older journals to consider articles which were not written in accordance with the dominant Anglo-American economic orthodoxy of the day.   The following journals were created during this period (many institutionally-backed journals are generalist, so we don't give details for all). Weltwirtschaftliches Archiv (Germany, 1913-)  Chinese Social and Political Science Review (China, 1916-1937) Review of Economics and Statistics  (U.S., 1919-) Economica (Britain, 1921-) International Labour Review (International, 1921-) Zeitschrift f√ºr Volkswirtschaft und Socialpolitik (Austria, 1921-1927) Journal of Business (U.S., 1922-) Annali di economia (Italy, 1924-) Economic Record (Australia, 1924-) Kyoto University Economic Review (Japan, 1926-?)

Although they relieved a good amount of backlog that had been accumulating, they were not specialist journals.  But academic economists are specialized people.  That means that the average subscriber to, say, the Bohemian Journal of Economics would have to consider himself extraordinarily lucky to find one or two articles of interest in every journal issue he received.  A specialized journal would be nice, they thought, but which institution is to provide it?  The easiest way was to form haphazard ""societies"" in a specialized academic subject and then hire a commercial publishing house to publish the ""society's"" journal.  Sometimes, one can dispense with the society altogether.  It was in some version of this that specialized journals -- such as the Journal of Economic Theory, the Journal of Public Economics, the Journal of Monetary Economics, etc. -- emerged.   Many of these were highly successful, climbing quickly in prestige over the older institution-backed journals. The need was certainly there for many of them.  But by the late 1980s, and certainly the mid-1990s, many people argue that things have gone perhaps a bit overboard (not only in economics, but in many other fields as well).   The big commercial publishing houses (you know who they are!) caught on to the game quickly enough.  Whatever journal they put out, there is always a demand (i.e. at worst, there are the university libraries who are generally ""forced"" to buy them).  Similarly, there is always a supply (economists, pressed by ""publish-or-perish"", always have articles).  And finding an editor is always easy (editorship of a journal brings professional prestige to an individual in the academic rat race -- a slight variation on the institutional prestige theme we talked about earlier).  So, in recent years, the publishing houses have been pushing journals like there was no tomorrow:  every topic and sub-topic and sub-sub-topic has its own journal today.   It is easy to see why this has gone too far: most are unaffordable to individuals (exorbitant prices are set to gouge libraries), quality per issue has declined (the few good articles in a field end up being spread too thin among the many competing journals) and, some claim, the situation has degenerated to the point where the publishing houses will gleefully put out ""personal boutique"" journals -- where little beyond the editor's own vanity or bid for self-promotion justifies its existence.  Currently, economics is the discipline with the largest number of new journals every year. Specialization, of course, breeds blinders -- so demand for a second type of journal -- the ""survey"" journal -- emerged in this period.  These journals collect and publish comprehensive and easy-to-understand surveys of the state of the art in various topics and fields.  Such surveys used to be occasionally published by the conventional journals such as Econometrica, as a way for specialists in other fields to have an idea what was going on somewhere else.   However, the degree of specialization in economics is such that more surveys are necessary, and ever more often, and ever simpler. There are now a handful of journals, such as the Journal of Economic Literature and the Journal of Economic Perspectives, dedicated exclusively to surveys.  [It has been speculated that the old general-purpose conventional journals might eventually be done in by this trend: economists today are happy enough to concentrate all their journal-reading on their own specialized sub-sub-field journal plus one or two general survey journals.] A third type of journal emerged in this period: the heterodox journal, such as the Review of Radical Political Economy, the Journal of Post Keynesian Economics, the Cambridge Journal of Economics, etc. These were established as non-mainstream economists were increasingly finding themselves blocked out of the existing journals.   Consequently, they organized themselves and formed journals dedicated to their own school-of-thought -- not unlike the mathematical economists did with Econometrica and RES in the early 1930s.  However, we should emphasize that the heterodox journal arose not out of a bid by a school of thought for institutional legitimacy. Indeed, some claim that quite the reverse happened: the worst thing for a heterodox school of thought to do is to ""ghettoize"" itself out of the mainstream with a journal (there is an exception to this rule: the early prestige of the JPE ensured that the Chicago School could ghettoize itself without appearing to actually do so).  Rather,  the emergence of the heterodox journal was an indicator of how bad things really got in terms of editorial decisions of the conventional journals. The following journals were established in this period.  We cannot hope to list all the publishing house journals here so the list just captures a few of the (more legitimate) earlier ones.

The Encyclop√©die," The great Encyclop√©die, ou Dictionnaire raisonn√© des sciences, des m√©tiers et des arts, (1751-65), edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert, was a landmark event of the French Enlightenement. Origins The Encyclop√©die of Diderot and d'Alembert was not the first encyclopedia.  Dictionaries consisting of reference articles on topics organized in alphabetical order had been around for a while, not only in France but also in England, Germany, Italy and elsewhere.   There were dictionaries of language and etymology, historical dictionaries (e.g. Pierre Bayle's), scientific dictionaries,  dictionaries of commerce (e.g. Savary's), dictionaries of  crafts, dictionaries of art, etc. and a few dictionaries of everything (e.g. Moreri, Chambers). Indeed, there were so many that a ""dictionary of dictionaries"" came out in 1758!   The mid-18th Century was gripped by a ""mania"" for dictionaries and publishers were eager to cash in on it.    In 1745, the Parisian publisher Andr√© Le Breton struck a deal with John Mills, an Englishman living in Paris, to produce a French translation of Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia or an Universal Dictionary of arts and sciences (which had been published in England in 1728). Mills, however, procrastinated, and a furious Le Breton eventually fired Mills (and beat him with a cane!).  When Le Breton re-launched the project with new partners in 1746,  it was adjusted to be not merely a straight translation of Chambers but rather a French ""adaptation"" of a universal dictionary of crafts and sciences from various sources. Le Breton hired the Abb√© Gua de Malves as editor-in-chief, who brought on board several younger assistants, including the technically-gifted Jean le Rond d'Alembert, a very young Etienne Bonnot de Condillac and the experienced translator Denis Diderot.  When Gua de Malves quit the project in October 1747,  Le Breton asked Diderot and d'Alembert to lead the project themselves. Diderot and d'Alembert threw themselves into the project.  They undertook extensive research in the craft workshops of Paris, solicited their friends in the ""republic of letters"" to compose entries, purchased engravings and hired an illustrator (Groussier) to add more.  But already at this stage, the project was endangered by Diderot's repeated scrapes with the authorities.  A provocative free-thinker, Diderot's anonymous treatise, Pens√©es philosophiques, had already been condemned by the Parlement of Paris in July 1746. When Diderot put out a controversial essay on blindness in 1749, Diderot was arrested and thrown into prison in Vincennes for several months.  Nonetheless, Diderot stayed with the project and in November 1750, Diderot and d'Alembert issued the final prospectus inviting subscriptions to the Encyclop√©die, ou Dictionnaire raisonn√© des sciences, des m√©tiers et des arts to be published by Le Breton in Paris.  The prospectus originally envisaged it as ten volumes with an additional two volumes of plate illustrations.   Diderot's prospectus emphasized that the Encyclop√©die would be unlike other dictionaries. It would not merely provide definitions, but also bring newly-discovered facts and fresh new perspectives, made possible by the revival of arts and sciences since the 17th C.  It sought to collect all in one reference work. It was not to be a dictionary of arcane curiosities, or erudite definitions, nor a handbook for practitioners, but a plain-spoken, direct dictionary of arts, sciences and technology ""to enlighten those who learn only for themselves"".  The Encyclop√©die became an event, perhaps the epitomizing event, of the French Enlightenement.  It is celebrated not so much for its content -  indeed, much of it was mundane and dull, more radical writing could be found elsewhere - as for its spirit and for the opposition it attracted.  It served as a lightning rod for both foes and friends of illuminisme. In the end, the Encyclop√©die would consist of 28 volumes (17 text volumes plus 11 plate volumes) published between 1751 and 1765, to which may be added the  five volumes of later supplements (published 1776-77) and two volumes of indexes (published 1780).  Overall, it was composed of 70,000 articles involving around 135 contributors.  In its original run,  over the course of its publication from 1751 to 1765, it would attract some 4,000 subscribers, about half of them in France, the other half abroad.  A full set of the original Encyclop√©die cost subscribers a little over 1,000 livres (or ¬£50 sterling then, or about US$11,000 today).  As such, it was a luxury affordable only to the well-to-do - mostly haute bourgeoisie and libraries in political and academic centers. Cheaper editions would be later brought out by foreign publishers, starting in the 1770s, and it would gradually become accessible to professionals, merchants and the middle classes of commercial and manufacturing cities. Publication (1751-1759) The first volume (A to Azy) of the Encyclop√©die came out in June 1751, with a ""Discours pr√©liminaire"" authored primarily by D'Alembert.  It  incorporated Diderot's prospectus, including a chart outlining the ""tree"" of human knowledge - how different sciences, fields and categories connected to each other.  The Jesuits, who dominated education in France, took an immediate dislike to the Encyclop√©die, and already in 1751, articles appeared in several publications (notably the Journal de Tr√©voux) accusing the Encyclop√©die of plagiarism and attacking it for criticizing Jesuit teaching methods, denigrating saints and kings, encouraging free-thinking and Deism and urging its proscription.   Diderot replied acerbically to some of his critics (notably the Jesuit writer Berthier) - conscious that controversy helped advertise the project and attracted more subscribers.   The leading philosophe of the age, Voltaire, in a counter-article in the Si√®cle (December, 1751),  rose to the defense and praised the Encyclop√©die.  Nonetheless, the philosophes could not prevent the appointment of a royal censor to watch the project.  However, the choice of censor - Malesherbes - turned out to be congenial to the project. The second volume (B to Ce) came out in February 1752.  Here began the participation of the Baron d'Holbach and the prolific Chevalier de Jaucourt (who would go on to author nearly a quarter of the articles of the Encyclop√©die).  The second volume contained a firecracker,  a controversial article on ""Certainty"" by Abb√© Jean-Martine des Prades, which caused a bit of a storm (it was eventually condemned as heretical by the Sorbonne and the Archbishop of Paris in November, 1752). A few days later, the Jesuits's supporters secured a royal order from the Council of State formally suppressing the Encyclop√©die.  What that meant in practice was not clear.  Prades and a few of the radical collaborators were exiled and publication was suspended.  But the sympathetic censor Malesherbes and the Madame de Pompadour, the king's powerful mistress, prevented the shut down of their offices and seizure of their papers. They insinuated that Diderot and d'Alembert ought to continue working as if nothing had happened. The third volume (Cha to Cons)  came out discretely in November 1753, and contained a series of economic articles by the Neo-Colbertiste economist Fran√ßois Veron de Forbonnais.  D'Alembert's article on schools (""Coll√®ge"") was highly critical of the Jesuit stranglehold on education, and provoked predictable protests.  But the polemics were not really sustained. The fourth volume (Cons to Diz) came out a year later (Oct 1754) without significant protests.  The fifth volume (Do to Es), which came out in November 1755, was preceded by the famous ""√âloge a Montesquieu"" by d'Alembert, a combative manifesto of Enlightenment thinking.  It also included the first articles contributed by Voltaire, who, sensing the succ√®s de scandale it was becoming, could not resist climbing aboard. It also contained the entry ""Economie"" authored by  Jean-Jacques Rousseau (Rousseau's numerous other articles were confined to music). The sixth volume (""Et to Fn"", Nov 1756) contained the first known contributions of writers who would later become the Physiocrats - two articles by Fran√ßois Quesnay (his first writings), three articles by a young Jacques Turgot, and some theological articles by the Abb√© Morellet. The venerable philosophe Voltaire contributed many articles to this volume, mostly related to literature and grammar. The Seventh volume (Fo to Gy) appeared in November 1757.  It again includes articles by Quesnay, Turgot and Morellet.  Once again Voltaire contributes many articles..  The late Montesquieu only (posthumous) contribution to the Encyclop√©die appeared now, an article on taste (""go√ªt""), completed by Voltaire. The seventh volume turned out to be the last volume for a while. Prior to its release, a series of articles had appeared over the summer of 1757 in the Mercure de France by conservative historian Jacob-Nicholas Moreau skewering the Encyclop√©die, satirizing the contributors as a  little ""indian tribe"", suggesting the writers are a tight-knit clique conspiring to overthrow morality, religion and even the government.  Given the assassination attempt on Louis XV by an unemployed lackey, Francois Damiens back in January 1757, this was not an idle allegation.  Parts of the French press eagerly insinuated an association  between ""free thinking"" encyclop√©disme and the attempted regicide.  The appearance of the seventh volume did nothing to calm those fears. One of  Voltaire's articles (""Geneva"", co-authored with d'Alembert) provoked a vituperative protest from the government of the Geneva Republic  A French religious group, led by the Franciscan friar Hayer, read a ""Deist"" profession of faith in the volume, and began pumping out La Religion Veng√©e, a series of volumes with detailed criticism of the Encyclopedie. But it also had its supporters. The periodical Journal encyclop√©dique, founded by Pierre Rousseau in 1756 and published over the border in Liege, had as its principal function the defense of the Encyclop√©die from its critics. In May 1758, while the eighth volume was in preparation, the radical hedonistic philosopher Claude-Adrien Helv√©tius published his treatise De l'√âsprit.  It was widely-read, scandalously-received and instantly condemned.  Although Helv√©tius was not a contributor to the Encyclop√©die, he was a personal friend of Diderot and other writers, and the critics did not parse the difference.  In the fall of 1758, the Jansenist A.J. Chaumeix launched a long series of detailed attacks on both, conjoining the two.   Egged on by Chaumeix and other parts of the press, the Parlement of Paris opened a session in January 1759 to examine the subversive works.  Helv√©tius's work was formally banned and burned.  The Encyclop√©die was also examined, and only just escaped proscription.  But it was clear its days were numbered.  Suspension (1759-1765) On March 8, 1759 the French crown revoked the publication of privileges of of the Encyclop√©die thereby suspending its publication.   Begun in 1751, only seven volumes had appeared so far, covering topics from A to G.  The suspension seems to have come about by the intervention of sympathizers - specifically Pompadour and Malesherbes - as a means to remove the matter from the legal courts and avoid more serious consequences.  Nonetheless, Malesherbes made it clear to the editors that the suspension would be enforced - that he would not tolerate its publication abroad.  A few months later, in July, the French government issued a decree ordering the publisher to Le Breton to refund subscribers for the missing volumes (but apparently no one took it up).   On September 3, 1759 Pope Clement XIII issued the encyclical ""Ut Primam"" [ch] condemning the Encyclop√©die. The polemics, which had reached their height in 1759, would linger during the suspension. Hayer's Society, Chaumeix and  Abb√© Gauchat continued pumping out their anti-encyclopediste pamphlets unabated. In May, 1760, Charles Palissot put on a farcical play at the Com√©die Fran√ßaise skewering the philosophes.   Having had enough, D'Alembert, resigned from the project in 1759.  Reportedly, it was due not merely the external problems, but also internal ones; the ego of some heavyweight contributors - namely Voltaire - had worn d'Alembert down.  Turgot, who had only recently proposed to write many articles, also decided to quit (Neymark, p.47).  Diderot was left in charge as sole editor.  In 1760, with the controversy beginning to die down, Le Breton and Diderot announced that they would begin publication of ""plate volumes"" for the continuing Encyclop√©die subscribers. These would consist almost purely of illustrations (with text merely describing the pictures).  This was implicitly allowed by the censor Malesherbes.  Over the course of the next decade (from 1762 to 1772),  Diderot arranged for the publication of eleven plate volumes in ten installments.  The appearance of the plate volumes was facilitated by the sudden change of mood in France.  The prosecution of the Jesuit Order by the Parlement of Paris in 1761 had stoked anti-religious feeling, raising it to a feverish pitch by 1762, and eliminated one of the Encyclop√©die's most vocal enemies (the Jesuits were expelled from France in 1763).  The other main anti-encyclopedists - Hayer, Chaumeix and Gauchat - quietly wound up their polemical pamphlets in 1762.  So the tide had turned by 1762.  It was not that the encyclopedistes were suddenly graced with public favor, but rather that the anti-encylopediste hysteria had waned.  As early as 1761, the Abb√© Irailh felt comfortable enough to write a sober account of the controversy as a past event rather than an on-going issue (Querelles Litt√©raires, v.4, p.118).  A volume put out by Abb√© Jean Saas in 1762 did not touch polemics, but merely pointed out factual errors and mistakes in the Encyclop√©die (albeit Saas's larger 1764 volume touches on some). French censorship had encouraged well-wishers abroad.  In 1762, the empress Catherine the Great of Russia invited Diderot to St. Petersburg, offering to allow him to continue publication of the text volumes there.  Diderot briefly considered it, but eventually turned it down.  Joseph of Austria (future Emperor Joseph II from 1765), an avid reader of the  Encyclop√©die, also tendered an offer. Resumption (1765-66) The break finally came in December 1765, with the death of Louis Ferdinand, Dauphin of France and son and heir of Louis XV.  Louis Ferdinand had been the principal supporter of the conservative religious party in the royal court, and an intractable enemy of the the project.  Within days of his death, Diderot announced the publication of the remaining ten volumes (volume 8 through volume 17) of the text Encyclop√©die.  Most appeared rather quickly in early 1766 (although stamped with a December 1765 date).  Diderot sidestepped the 1759 suspension (formally still in effect) with a careful rewording of the title and adding the false imprint of Samuel Fauche of  Neufch√¢tel (Switzerland), to suggest the volumes were being published abroad.  The new royal censor Sartine (a friend of Diderot's) turned a blind eye and let it go forward.  The only wrinkle in the resumption was when publisher Andr√© Le Breton was arrested and briefly imprisoned for having dispatched copies of the remaining volumes to Versailles without permission.   There are few articles of interest written by economists in the remaining volumes. As noted, Turgot, who had planned several, never finished them. Voltaire contributed a bunch to volume 8, and it is sometimes suggested that Claude Dupin wrote the article on salt mines for volume 14. The journals of the day were largely quiet about the publication of the remaining volumes in 1766.  The only real polemical attempt was Maleville's 1766 attack on the ""Eclectique"" article, but it wasn't followed up.  The volumes and the supplement (see below) passed largely without controversy in the press, until Barruel's wider-ranging attack on the philosophes in general in 1781, drawing evidence from the Encyclopedie articles.  (A couple of decades later, in his famous 1797 Memoirs, Barruel would blame the wild Jacobinism of the French Revolution on the influence of the Encyclop√©die). Suppl√©ments (1776-77) From the start, it was clear the Encyclop√©die was deficient. Setting aside the objections to the content by religious conservative critics, even sympathizers like Grimm and Voltaire noted its faults.  D'Alembert characterized it as a harlequin's outfit - some sparkling gems, but the rest of it rags.  Saas's 1762-64 letters showed up embarrassing errors.  In a memorandum written in 1768, Diderot outlined the problems.  Besides the numerous factual mistakes, it failed to properly cover physics, and chemistry almost not at all, that the sections on mathematics and natural history needed to be expanded, that great swathes of articles on philosophy (logic, metaphysics and ethics) were poorly written or plagiarized, geography was inconsistent, the art sections needed serious revision from experts, and that the plates did not connect well with the text. Already many had predicted there would have to be a second, corrected edition of the Encyclop√©die.  But the publisher Andr√© Le Breton balked at the prospect.  The original subscribers, who had paid a hefty price, would likely be infuriated to find their expensive set obsolete so quickly. Finding a new set of subscribers would mean scraping the poorer down-market, and less likely to cover the costs.  Moreover, the official suspension was still place, and having visited the Bastille, Le Breton was not willing to risk the ire of the authorities again.  Le Breton sold the rights to the Encyclop√©die to another publisher Charles-Joseph Panckoucke in December 1768. Diderot was asked by Pancoucke in 1769 to stay on as editor for the second edition, but turned it down.  Diderot had already promised the empress Catherine of Russia in 1768 that the second edition would be printed in St. Petersburg, under her patronage, and was already making separate plans (they turned out for naught - Diderot went to Russia in the early 1770s full of enthusiasm, but could not get his old friends or the Russians to give him anything more than promises; Diderot returned to France in 1774, disappointed by the whole experience, swearing off any encyclopedic projects, and moving on to other things). Pancoucke soon encountered the problems Le Breton had feared: he could not drum up enough new subscribers or writers for a completely revised new edition. So Pancoucke scrapped the original plan and instead announced he would re-print the original edition, largely as it was (incorporating only the corrections of Saas) for any new subscribers, and to add a few supplementary volumes to be sold to the original subscribers.  This ran immediately into trouble.  As Pancoucke began re-printing the first volumes in early 1770, the French authorities cracked down on the printing house and impounded the copies.  Pancoucke consequently decided to split the project - focusing on the supplementary volumes, and outsourcing the reprinting the original Encyclop√©die to partners abroad.  After prolonged negotiations with the republican authorities of Geneva, the re-edition of the originals finally begin to come out in 1771, published by Gabriel Cramer in Geneva for Pancoucke.. There still remained the Suppl√©ment volumes to organize. With Diderot uninterested, Pancoucke tapped Jean-Baptiste Ren√© Robinet, an ex-Jesuit turned philosophe to serve as editor of the Suppl√©ment volumes.  Voltaire jumped aboard eagerly, and began writing articles to contribute to the supplement.  But few others were as enthusiastic.  Robinet obtained promises, but many failed to deliver.  As the delays prolonged, some of the early contributors decided to withdraw their articles and print them separately on their own. Voltaire took some of the hundred articles he had prepared and published them as Questions sur l'Encyclop√©die (1770-72), an irreverent mini-encyclopedia of his own.   D'Alembert's protege, the Marquis de Condorcet, withdrew his articles on monopoly and monopolist to publish separately.  Condorcet's other articles, mostly on pure mathematics, however, would remain. After much wrangling, the Suppl√©ment volumes prepared by Robinet finally came out, composed of four text volumes and one plate volume.  The first two text volumes came out in 1776, the last two plus the plate volume in 1777.   They were published by Pancoucke in Paris and Marc-Michel May in Amsterdam.  The cap the project, two index volumes, edited by pastor Pierre Mouchon, were published in 1780. Encyclop√©die m√©thodique (1782-1832) The ink was still wet on the Encyclop√©die when Charles Joseph Pancoucke launched a new encyclopedia project to supplant the old one.  This new work, the Encyclop√©die m√©thodique, was to be grander, larger and better organized than the Encyclop√©die of Diderot and d'Alembert.  It would be more modern, more correct, more scientific, written (or revised from other dictionaries) by experts rather than amateurs or freelance hacks, and purged of the irreverence and outdated polemics of mid-century philosophes.  In some ways, the Encyclop√©die m√©thodique would be the encyclopedia that Diderot and d'Alembert had probably originally hoped for, but did not have the resources or time to pull together.  Dissatisfied with the fragmented structure of the original Encyclop√©die.  Pancoucke divided the volumes into subject areas, and had experts write comprehensive reviews of each subject in a single article, rather than forcing the reader to scamper around multiple fractional articles just to get the general idea.  It was a sprawling work of over 200 volumes - 157 text volumes and the remainder plates.  But it really consists of some 35 separate multi-volume dictionaries, with one universal index volume.  The Encyclop√©die m√©thodique, would take a half-century to complete - beginning in 1782 and finishing only in 1832.  As such, it spanned over multiple dramatic and dizzying political and social changes in France - the Revolution, the Empire, the Restoration.  Pancocke died in 1798, and it would have to be completed by his son-in-law Henri Agasse. The economics articles were originally supposed to be under the supervision of the Physiocrat Abb√© Nicolas  Baudeau.  Indeed, Baudeau edited the three volumes on Commerce (pulling its articles mostly from the pre-Physiocratic 1723 Dictionnaire universel du commerce of Jacques Savary de Bruslons).  But Baudeau was too busy to edit the four volumes on political economy proper (√âconomie politique et diplomatique) which drew articles, including Quesnay's own, from the original Encyclop√©die.  So the task was given instead to Jean Nicolas D√©meunier.  More inclined to the more recent economics of Adam Smith, D√©meunier drew much from Smith for his articles.  However, one of the main contributors to the economics volume, Guillaume Grivel, was a dyed-in-the-wool Physiocrat, and wrote his articles from that perspective, drawing from Quesnay and Mercier de la Riviere.  As a result, there are competing Physiocratic and Classical economics articles,  unsynthesized, sitting side-by-side, in the Encyclop√©die m√©thodique.  It is curious that Quesnay's original article ""Grains"", an exposition of  the Physiocratic doctrine, was not used for the ""Grains"" entry here (written by D√©meunier) but rather re-appeared in Grivel's article ""Bled"". The dictionary on finance drew much from the Oeconomiques of Claude Dupin (1745-46) and the Recherches (1758) of Fran√ßois Veron de Forbonnais and the M√©moires concernans les impositions (1768-69) of Jean-Louis Moreau de Beaumont.
     The Encyclop√©die, ou Dictionnaire raisonn√© des sciences, des m√©tiers et des arts, edited by Denis Diderot and Jean Le Rond d'Alembert, consists of 28 total volumes - 17 text volumes (1751-65) plus 11 plate volumes (1762-72) Suppl√©ments to Encylop√©die L‚ÄôEncyclop√©die m√©thodique ou par ordre de mati√®res par une soci√©t√© de gens de lettres, de savants et d'artistes ; pr√©c√©d√©e d'un Vocabulaire universel, servant de Table pour tout l'Ouvrage, orn√©e des Portraits de MM.

Physiocratic Journals," At their height during the French Enlightenment, the Physiocrats enjoyed access to two periodicals at different times to communicate and spread their ideas - the Journal d'agriculture, du commerce & des finances from 1765 to 1767, and the √âph√©m√©rides du citoyen thereafter from 1767 to 1776. Contents I - Introduction to the Physiocratic Journals Prelude The burgeoning Enlightenment spirit of the 18th Century called forth a splurge of energy to bring practical information on arts and sciences to readers.  Its first spate of energy was packaged in the form of dictionaries - the production of which became a veritable mania from the 1720s through 1740s.  Among the economics-dedicated ones of this period was the celebrated Dictionnaire universel du commerce of Jacques Savary de Bruslons in 1723.  Coming at the end of this era, and opening a new one, was the great Encyclop√©die, ou Dictionnaire raisonn√© des sciences, des m√©tiers et des arts,  edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert, which began to be published in 1751.   It purported to go beyond mere definitions but provide whole systematic articles, incorporating all the latest scientific knowledge.  The Neo-Colbertiste economist  Fran√ßois Veron de Forbonnais contributed most of the economics-related articles in the early volumes of the Encyclop√©die (volumes 3 through 5, 1753-55) and  Jean-Jacques Rousseau was tapped for its important ""Economie"" article in v.5 (1755).  But in  the sixth (1756) and seventh (1757) volumes, the early Physiocrats - Fran√ßois Quesnay, the young Jacques Turgot and the Abb√© Morellet, still in their pre-Physiocratic phase - contributed several articles to the Encyclop√©die (albeit the bulk of the economic articles were now written by the indefatigable Charles-√âtienne Pesselier, a tax farmer). The Encyclop√©die was suspended in 1759.  By this time, Quesnay had devised his Tableau Economique, and Turgot had drafted several unpublished articles for the Encyclop√©die, but neither had a venue to publish.  So they turned to the reviews. There were several French periodicals and journals dedicated, or open, to economic matters that cropped up during the Enlightenment age, the most notable of which were: The Journal oeconomique, ou, M√©moires, notes et avis sur l'agriculture, les arts, le commerce &tc., was arguably the first European review dedicated exclusively to economic topics - agriculture, industry and commerce.  It was founded in Paris by Antoine Boudet, begun as a monthly in January 1751.   Its April 1751 issue contained the famous article by Ren√© Louis de Voyer, Marquis d'Argenson with the famous story of Colbert and the merchants, and their ""laissez nous faire"" reply. (p.111).  The Journal oeconomique ruled the roost for nearly two decades, folding only in 1772. In 1754, seeing the potential market for a competing economics journal, the publishers of La Nouvelle bigarrure (f.1749) reset and renamed their publication Le Nouvelliste oeconomique et litt√©raire. The Nouvelliste was dedicated to collecting and reprinting articles from other journals and newspapers, French and foreign, about the rural economy, estate management, agriculture and developments in the mechanical arts.  . In 1759, another French economic review,  the Journal de commerce was founded by the Abb√© Roubaud and Le Camus, and entered into publication in Brussels.  It was the third such dedicated publication in a now crowded market.  Competition did not hold for long.  In 1761, the Nouvelliste folded, followed soon by the Journal du Commerce in 1762, leaving only the Journal oeconomique.   But Roubaud and Le Camus re-launched their journal in Paris in January 1765, under a new title, the Gazette du Commerce.  This one would last (with some interruptions) until 1783.  In 1765, the Paris-edited Gazette du Commerce initiated the publication of a monthly journal, as a supplementary annex to the Gazette, collecting weightier theoretical and policy essays.  This supplement was entitled the Journal de l'agriculture, du commerce et des finances (henceforth JdACF)  The creation of the journal was encouraged by the controller-general Cl√©ment Charles Fran√ßois de Laverdy.  The first issue of JdACF came out in July 1765, with  Le Trosne (under his own name) taking up the cudgels for free trade against the Neo-Colbertistes.  But things took a decided turn in September of that year when, under the influence of some well-wishers (probably Abb√© Morellet or Trudaine), the young Pierre Samuel Dupont de Nemours, was appointed editor of the JdACF.  For the next year,  from September 1765 until November 1766, the JdACF  under the editorship of the young Dupont de Nemours became the veritable mouthpiece of the Physiocratic sect. Nearly all the great Physiocrats contributed regularly to it. The Physiocratic leader Fran√ßois Quesnay published numerous articles in it, under a variety of pseudonyms - ""Mr. H"", ""Mr. N."", ""Mr. de l'Isle"", ""Mr. Nisaque"" (an anagram of his name) and even engaged in self-debates between his alternate personae (e.g. between Mr. H, an opponent, and Mr. N a proponent, of Physiocracy)  Other contributors included Dupont de Nemours himself (as ""Editeur"" and ""Mr. C""), the Marquis of Mirabeau (as ""Mr. F""), Mercier de la Rivi√®re (as ""Mr. G""), Saint-P√©ravy (as ""Mr.K"") and Le Trosne (under his own name and as ""Mr. M"").  Annoyed at the Physiocratic splurge,  the Abb√© Baudeau, then still a conventional Colbertiste, launched his own journal in November 1765, the Eph√©m√©rides du citoyen (see below).  When La Trosne published a pro-Physiocratic article in the Eph√©m√©rides, Baudeau reciprocated with a a counter-article in the JdACF (as ""M. l'Abb√© B***"").  But the duel was short-lived - Baudeau himself would be converted to Physiocracy over the course of the next year. In December 1766, the Gazette director Thomas-Fran√ßois de Gr√¢ce fired Dupont de Nemours, and appointed the Abb√© Claude Yvon as the new editor of the JdACF.  Yvon promptly shut out the Physiocrats and gave the journal over to the Neo-Colbertistes.  Veron de Forbonnais (""Mr. ABCD"") appeared regularly from 1767 onwards.  In 1769, the journal  added ""des artes"", and became known as Journal de l'agriculture, du commerce, des arts et des finances. While the JdACF was in Neo-Colbertiste hands, the Physiocrats decamped to Baudeau's journal, Eph√©m√©rides du citoyen. In 1770, Abb√© Roubaud took over the Gazette and the JdACF from de Gr√¢ce.  Under his editorship, from June 1770, Roubad re-oriented the JdACF back into the liberal camp, running alongside the Eph√©m√©rides for a while.  Roubaud's famous defenses of the Physiocrats against their critics, notably against Galiani in 1770 and against Linguet in 1774, were published in the form of letters in the Gazette.  Ultimately, it was a series of articles critical of the Maurepas administration led to suppression of the JdACF in December 1774. Roubaud went into exile. The JdACF resumed publication in January 1778,  under the editorship of Hubert Pascal Ameilhon.  Blavet's French translation of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations appeared serialized as columns in the JdACF from January 1779 to December 1780.  Ameilhon stepped down in late 1781, when the editorship was taken up by the Abb√© Fontenai, who renamed it Journal d'agriculture, commerce, artes et finances and edited it down to its last issue in December 1783.  It was then absorbed by the Affiches, Annonces et Avis divers, which adopted subtitle Journal g√©n√©ral de France, which later became its main title in 1785. A supplement devoted to agriculture was issued from 1787 to 1790. (The contributor key for the JdACF for the years 1765-66 was revealed by Dupont de Nemours in his ""Avertissement"" of April, 1769 (p.x) of the Ephemerides du citoyen)  [entry in Hatin]  This journal was first founded as a biweekly sheet (modeled after the English Spectator) by Abb√© Nicholas Baudeau in November 1765, under the title √âph√©m√©rides du citoyen, ou chronique de l'√©sprit national.   It was published every Monday and Friday, from November 4, 1765 to October 31, 1766.  It began as a Neo-Colbertiste response to the Physiocrat-dominated Journal d'agriculture, du commerce et des finances  (JdACF).  When Le Trosne published an article in the √âph√©m√©rides promoting free trade, Baudeau reciprocated by publishing an article in the JdACF.  This opened up a debate with Dupont de Nemours , editor of the JdACF.  Baudeau eventually met personally with Dupont to discuss the issues, and was soon converted to Physiocracy himself. When Dupont was dismissed and the JdACF taken over by Colbertistes in December, 1766, Baudeau reformatted his own journal, which began appearing as a monthly in January 1767 under the title  √âph√©m√©rides du citoyen, ou biblioth√®que raisonn√©e des sciences morales et politiques.   The Abb√© Baudeau stepped down as editor a year later, and appointed Dupont de Nemours as editor of the √âph√©m√©rides from May 1768.  After Baudeau was called to Poland on ecclesiastical affairs in late 1768, Dupont de Nemours became also  the official director from January 1769. The √âph√©m√©rides du citoyen became the new Physiocratic journal, and the Physiocrats were once again regular contributors under a new set of pseudonyms: Fran√ßois Quesnay (as ""Mr. A"" or ""Alpha""), Marquis of Mirabeau (as ""Mr. B""), Jacques Turgot (as ""Mr.C"" or ""Mr.X""),  Dupont de Nemours  (as ""Mr. H""),  Abb√© Baudeau  (as ""Mr.L"" or ""L.B.""),  Abb√© Roubaud (as ""Mr. G"" or ""Mr. R""), Saint-P√©ravy  (as ""Mr. Q""), Vauvilliers (as ""Mr.Y""). According to Dupont de Nemours, Mercier de la Rivi√®re (Mr. G in JdACF), La Trosne (Mr. M in JdACF) and unknown (Mr. L in JdACF, Abeille?) did not contribute to the √âph√©m√©rides (at least not prior to April 1769). The √âph√©m√©rides du citoyen continued publication until March 1772, when it was suppressed by royal order.  In late 1773, Abb√© Nicholas Baudeau having returned from abroad, launched a new journal under the title Nouvelles √âph√©m√©rides √©conomiques, ou biblioth√®que raisonn√©e de l'histoire, de la morale et de la politique.  This new journal ran from December 1773 to June 1776, through the duration of the Turgot administration.

The Edinburgh Review," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by The Edinburgh Review or any other journal or organization.] The Edinburgh Review or Critical Journal was one of the most prominent and widely-circulating of the great British political and literary reviews of the 19th C. From its beginning in 1802 until at least the 1840s, The Edinburgh Review maintained a strong laissez-faire and reformist bent, thrusting the journalistic knee to the back of the Whig spine. It played an instrumental role in the development of the classical school of economics and its wide circulation helped propagate classical liberalism in Britain.    The Edinburgh Review was founded in 1802, jointly by Sydney Smith, Francis Jeffrey, Francis Horner and Henry Brougham.  All were quite young at the time - Smith was 31, Jeffrey 29, Horner 24 and Brougham 23.  Most had been students of Dugald Stewart. at the University of Edinburgh and members of the ""Speculative Society"", a discussion club of Edinburgh students formed back in 1764.  Jeffrey had attended the University of Glasgow, but was active in the Edinburgh society. Sydney Smith, the only Englishman among the group, had come to Edinburgh to study under Stewart.  All had been trained as lawyers, all were largely classical liberals, adherents to the principles of laissez-faire and political Whigs (if not quite perfectly clear immediately) The Edinburgh Review can be regarded as the testament of the (waning) Scottish Enlightenment, its bequest unto the new century, and transmitter of that spirit beyond Scotland to the country as a whole .  The founders consciously named their journal after another Edinburgh Review - Adam Smith's pugnacious journal of 1755, which had lasted only a few numbers.  The new ER's political bias was unapologetic - its buff and blue cover was instantly recognizable as the colors of the Whig party (colors supposedly originally chosen by Whig leader Charles James Fox in honor of George Washington's uniforms).  The ER quartet saw themselves as fulfilling the vision of their venerable teacher Dugald Stewart, giving birth to a new liberal political order, reviving the moribund Whig Party with a new ideology and deploying it as the vehicle for liberal political, economic and social change.  As Sydney Smith later recollected: ""To appreciate the value of the Edinburgh Review, the state of England at the period when that journal began should be had in remembrance. The Catholics were not emancipated ‚Äî the Corporation and Test Acts were unrepealed ‚Äî the Game Laws were horribly oppressive ‚Äî Steel-traps and spring-guns were set all over the country ‚Äî Prisoners tried for their lives could have no counsel ‚Äî Lord Eldon and the Court of Chancery pressed heavily on mankind ‚Äî Libel was punished by the most cruel and vindictive imprisonments ‚Äî the principles of Political Economy were little understood ‚Äî The Law of Debt and Conspiracy were on the worst footing ‚Äî the enormous wickedness of the Slave Trade was tolerated ‚Äî a thousand evils were in existence which the talents of good and noble men have since lessened or removed: and these efforts have been not a little assisted by the honest boldness of the Edinburgh Review"". (Sydney Smith, 1839, Works, p.vi) When it came out in 1802, the Edinburgh Review was largely unprecedented as a publication.  Sitting somewhere between a scientific journal and a chatty magazine, its articles consisted of essay-length reviews of recently-published books on politics, literature, philosophy and science.  It sought to bring the latest progress on the intellectual frontier to the educated middle classes of Britain, broadly speaking. It was read not only by scholars and artists, but also by politicians, civil servants, lawyers, doctors,  etc.  It sought not merely to inform, but transform, public opinion.  Its reviews were usually overtly biased and polemical, sometimes savage outright, but that sharp edge only increased its appeal to readers.  The ER adopted as its motto ""Judex damnatus cum nocens absolvitur"" (""condemned is the judge who absolves the guilty""). (Sydney Smith had originally proposed a line from Virgil ""Tenui musam meditamur avena"" - ""We cultivate the muse upon a little oatmeal""). The Edinburgh Review was published quarterly by printer Archibald Constable of Edinburgh, Scotland, at that time already publisher of the Whiggish weekly Scots Magazine. Issue numbers came out Oct, Jan, Apr, July until 1810, thereafter Nov, Feb, May, Aug.  It was originally designed for contributions ""by gentlemen"", without remuneration, although arrangements were eventually made to pay each reviewer ¬£10 and the editor ¬£200 per year.  The reviews were all anonymous.  Although authorship was sometimes easy to deduce from hints elsewhere (e.g. in correspondence, or by later reprints in collected works), many of the ER's articles remain unattributed, or only speculatively attributed, to this day. Although originating in Scotland, the ER was also distributed in England.  The printer T.N. Longman of London had a long-standing agreement to serve as the sales agent and distributor of Archibald Constable's publications in the south.  But Constable felt that Longman (at that time publisher of the Eclectic Review and Annual Review) had a conflict of interest and so placed the southern distribution of the ER in charge of Andrew Murray of Fleet Street.  This caused a bit of legal ripple between Constable and Longman.  After Murray died in 1809, Constable tried to set up his own branch in London (Constable, Hunter, Park & Hunter), but it failed very quickly and so southern distribution was placed in the hands of White, Cochrane & Co.  In 1814, Constable and Longman reconciled, and Longman resumed his role as southern distributor.   Ruined by the financial crisis of 1825, Archibald Constable went bankrupt in early 1826, and full rights for publication of the Edinburgh Review was taken up by  T.N. Longman of London, while Adam Black became the publisher in Edinburgh. The first issue of the Edinburgh Review came out in October 10, 1802, under the editorship of Sydney Smith.  Francis Jeffrey took over the editing role in 1803, and would remain at the helm until 1829, when Jeffrey was elected as Dean of the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh by the Scottish Bar and felt continuing as editor would be a conflict of interest.  He was replaced as editor by Macvey Napier (who had served as Constable's editor for the famous 1824 Supplement to Encyclopaedia Britannica).  Napier became chief editor of the ER in 1829. Other Scottish characters who contributed to the enterprise included writers like Sir Walter Scott, scientist John Playfair, philosopher Thomas Brown, orientalist Alexander Hamilton, jurists Henry Cockburn, Sir John Mackintosh and  Macvey Napier, essayist Thomas Carlyle, divines Thomas Chalmers and William Hamilton,  and economists like James Mill and, most prolifically, John Ramsay McCulloch.  English contributors included William Hazlitt, T. Robert Malthus, Robert Torrens and, most actively, Thomas Macaulay.  Irish contributors include the politician Henry Parnell and scientist-economist Dionysus Lardner.  Notable later economist contributors include Herman Merivale, Richard Whately, Nassau W. Senior and John Stuart Mill. In 1809, Sir Walter Scott, annoyed at the strong Whig atmosphere Francis Jeffrey was imposing on the ER, decamped and helped found the Quarterly Review in London, as the Tory response to the ER.  The continuous duel between the liberal Whig Edinburgh Review and conservative Tory Quarterly Review would run through much of the 19th C.  It was an acute but elevated rivalry, driving - not merely driven by - British politics. More bitter was the ER's the cross-town rivalry with the rabidly ultra-Tory monthly Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine (f.1817), and the brawls between them were vicious.   To the left of the ER was the Radicals' quarterly, the Westminster Review (f.1824), founded by utilitarian philosophers Jeremy Bentham and James Mill. On a lower rung were the lighter monthlies: the old and mildly Whiggish Monthly Review (founded 1749, the first to begin the custom of offering reviews) and the High Tory Critical Review (founded 1756, folded 1817, its role duly taken up by the BEM).  The Dissenters had the Eclectic Review (f.1801), the Catholics had the Dublin Review (f.1836), so we can safely say by the 1830s all parties and factions of Britain were represented by their own literary review.  In economics, however, the Edinburgh Review had no parallel.  Henry Brougham and Francis Horner produced most of the economic articles from 1802 until 1818, when  John Ramsey McCulloch was brought on board.  Through to the end of the 1830s, McCulloch used the ER to promote the doctrines of the Classical School.  The ER was probably the only British review that published regular, serious articles on economics.   During the height of the classical era, by one calculation (O'Brien, 2004: 16), fifteen members of the Political Economy Club wrote for the Edinburgh Review, six for the Westminster Review, four for the Quarterly Review and none for Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. By 1850, the Edinburgh Review had published 250 economics-related articles, 78 of which were by McCulloch alone.  In terms of circulation: Edinburgh Review sold 14,000, Quarterly Review 10,000 Blackwoods Edinburgh Magazine 6,000 and the Westminster Review 2-3,000.

The Westminster Review," [Note: Part of the HET Website.  This page is not related to or endorsed by The Westminster Review or any other journal or organization.] British review,  published quarterly, associated with the Philosophical Radicals.  Founded in 1823 by Sir John Bowring and utilitarian philosophers Jeremy Bentham and James Mill. Beginning with its first issue in 1824, the Westminster Review counted among its early contributors the young John Stuart Mill, George Grote, Edwin Chadwick, William Ellis among others, and threw its weight behind the political questions of the day such as the Corn Laws, slavery, prison reform, religious tests, etc.  The Philosophical Radicals also had the Globe. Alongside the Whig Edinburgh Review and the Tory Quarterly Review, the Westminster Review was one of the three principal political, economic and literary journals in 19th C. Britain. In 1828, T. Perronet Thompson took over the Westminster Review and the Mills withdrew (Bowring stayed on as editor).  A new journal, the London Review, projected in 1834, started publishing in April 1835, with Sir William Molesworth as principal backer and John Stuart Mill as editor (although not announced).  But shortly after, Molesworth bought the Westminster Review and by the fifth number (April 1836), the two reviews were unified under the title of The London and Westminster Review until 1840, when it became simply Westminster Review again. Poet Thomas Moore  famously mocked  the appeal of the Westminster Review to 'bluestocking' intellectuals.      As contributions were anonymous, we have made use of F.W. Fetter (1962) attribution of authors, and other sources.
